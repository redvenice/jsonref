The message was crystal clear: Brad’s a deadbeat dad. Furious Pitt hit back immediately, saying he’d loaned his wife $8 million for a house in which to live with their children, and given her $1.3 million for bills. That’s a lot of money for 18 months of childcareFriends told the New York Post he had fulfilled all financial obligations to his kids, including payments for therapists, travel expenses and round-the-clock bodyguards.The friends added that Jolie is being ‘ridiculously unreasonable’ and is ‘fuelled by anger’.They also said how hurt Pitt is by her decision to make this damning ‘deadbeat dad’ allegation in open court rather than in front of a private judge as the rest of the orce has so far been heard.I’m sure he is.It’s hard to imagine a worse thing for any father to be accused of then failing to take proper care of his children.It’s also hard to imagine a worse thing for any child than reading, or seeing on TV, that their father is a mean tightwad who refuses to take responsibility for them.In any orce, a lot of mud gets slung.No marriage ends happily, whatever absurd PR spin some celebrity couples try to put on their ‘conscious uncoupling’.But when children are involved, the right thing to do, indeed the imperative thing to do, is to keep the mudslinging behind closed doors.If you’re going to shout insults at each other, do it when the kids can’t hear it.If you want to make very damaging legal claims about each other, then don’t do it in open court.This is particularly important for anyone famous because once this stuff gets into the public domain, then it stays there for your children to read for the rest of their lives.Angelina Jolie knows this better than anyone, as she’s now been married three times.  Angelina should know that once it\u0027s in the public domain it\u0027s there for your children to read forever. She\u0027e been married three times (seen here with first husband Johnny Lee Miller) and she lived through her own famous parents\u0027 bitter orce after Jon Voight cheatedShe also knows from her own parents’ bitter orce (her mother Marcheline Bertrand left her father Jon Voight when Angelina was a toddler, after he cheated) how scarring it can be to have lurid details of your parents’ break-up set in permanent internet stone.So why would she decide to publicly humiliate her own children’s father like this?And why would she further compound the children’s unhappiness by making it hard for him to see them when he wants to?Unlike most ‘deadbeat dads’, Pitt has been fighting to see more, not less of his kids.But Jolie has apparently been resisting this so vigorously that the orce judge reportedly warned her in June to stop it or risk losing primary custody.He was also said to have ordered her to provide Pitt with a cell phone number for each child, to allow him to call whenever he wants, barred her from reading the children’s text messages from their father, and laid out a summer schedule for each child to see him.I don’t know the truth about what’s gone wrong in the Brangelina marriage – only they do.          So why would she decide to publicly humiliate her own children’s father like this?  Unlike most ‘deadbeat dads’, Pitt has been fighting to see more, not less of his kids. But Jolie has apparently been resisting this vigorously. I don\u0027t know why Angelina is now behaving in such an irrational and vicious mannerBy his own admission, Brad wasn’t a perfect father or husband and seemed to have hit some kind of mid-life crisis by the time they split.Nor do I know why Angelina is now behaving in such an irrational and vicious manner. Though some fear her rage may not be entirely unconnected to the fact his new girlfriend is a stunning and brilliantly clever MIT professor, Neri Oxman.However, what I do know is that Angelina’s decision to publicly attack him this week can only turn out to be incredibly damaging to their children.And it sits very uneasily with her claim that those children ‘will always come first’.But then what Angelina says and does are often two very different things.For example, she once said: ‘To be intimate with a married men, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn’t be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.’Then she fell in love with Jennifer Anniston’s husband Brad Pitt on the film Mr and Mrs Smith, and stole him from her.So Angelina’s halo, which she ruthlessly ensures has an almost permanent glisten to it, may not shine quite so brightly when she looks away from the mirror.There’s also another weird aspect to her court action this week.Angelina Jolie has always proudly affirmed herself as a tough, independent woman who doesn’t need a man to help her get on in life.           Angelina’s halo may not shine quite so brightly anymore . Also, she\u0027s always proudly affirmed herself as a tough, independent woman who doesn’t need a man to help her get on in life. So WHY now look so grasping, whining, needy and man-reliant?The true embodiment, you might think, of modern feminism.And she’s been remarkably successful at it, making more money from movies and endorsements than almost any actress in history.So why would she now want to make herself look so grasping, whining, needy and man-reliant?If Angelina Jolie really thinks Brad Pitt is a useless deadbeat dad, then what better way to prove it then to tell him to stuff his money where the sun don’t shine and provide for her kids herself?She can certainly easily afford to if she wishes.Instead, she’s chosen to deliberately, and what may well be falsely, embarrass the father of her children in public.That’s such a weak, cheap shot Angelina – especially for a humanitarian who says she always puts her children first."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/09/19/4EF4FE5100000578-6044653-image-a-24_1533838484154.jpg","title":"Lions lionesses playing London Zoo match Gareth Southgates lions","story":"    Having a gnawsome time trying to get at the catnip, this Asiatic lioness tries to get its claws into a Boomer ball filled with the herb during a photocall at the ZSL London Zoo, ahead of World Lion Day (August 10)          Not so cuddly now: a lioness growls at the approaching Bhanu, right. Asiatic lions are up to 2.9m in length, from nose to tail, and the males weigh about 160-190kg, while the females weigh 110-120kg.

Carolyn Harris, Welsh deputy leader, vehemnetly denies the accusations and described a \u0027lovely\u0027 office atmosphere filled with \u0027banter\u0027, where colleagues were friends who laughed and talked about \u0027anything and everything\u0027          The \u0027dyke boots\u0027 that Miss Clarke wore to work were ridiculed by her boss, Mrs Harris says she does not remember saying anything and if she did it would have been \u0027banter\u0027They were made during the trial of Miss Clarke, her former constituency office manager, on fraud and forgery charges. Last week, Miss Clarke was cleared at Cardiff Crown Court after being accused of awarding herself a £2,000 pay rise and cutting her work hours without her boss\u0027s authority.Miss Clarke, 42, had been accused of forging Mrs Harris\u0027s signature on a form, submitted to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) in August 2015, increasing her £37,000-a-year salary and reducing her 40-hour working week to 37.5 hours.When Ipsa sent a confidential email to Mrs Harris to confirm the change, the prosecution claimed Miss Clarke accessed the MP\u0027s account and replied: \u0027Yes, this is correct.\u0027 Furious Tory MP accuses No10 of launching a ¿witch hunt¿...Corbyn \u0027handed ultimatum by powerful backers Momentum who...Share this articleBut Miss Clarke insisted she was following Mrs Harris\u0027s verbal instructions, claiming it was common practice for her to sign forms on behalf of the \u0027over-bearing\u0027 MP, whom, she said, \u0027detested paperwork\u0027.Indeed, the picture Miss Clarke painted of a highly dysfunctional office — hotly disputed by the MP — raises questions about Carolyn Harris\u0027s suitability for the Shadow front bench role.For Miss Clarke claimed in court that the MP had also \u0027outed\u0027 her to colleagues, after she confided in Mrs Harris she was gay in 2011, quizzed her on her sex life and made fun of her \u0027dyke\u0027 boots.          Miss Clarke says working for Mrs Harris felt like being in the \u0027Army\u0027 and that she felt \u0027more like a slave than an employee\u0027Here, in her first interview since she was cleared, Miss Clarke reveals she, too, was at the Swansea Pride event — and hid from her former boss.\u0027I felt sick when I saw her dancing, waving her arms and laughing with people at the parade. I was so overwhelmed by anxiety, I was shaking,\u0027 says Miss Clarke.\u0027From the day I confided in her that I was in a gay relationship, her attitude towards me seemed to change overnight.\u0027Miss Clarke also alleged in court that in November 2014, Mrs Harris had grabbed her by the hair as she sat at her desk, violently shaking her head — a claim strenuously denied by the MPInstead, Mrs Harris described a \u0027lovely\u0027 office atmosphere filled with \u0027banter\u0027, where colleagues were friends who laughed and talked about \u0027anything and everything\u0027.As for the reference to \u0027dyke\u0027 boots, she said: \u0027I don\u0027t remember saying that, but if I did, it would have been banter. I\u0027m certainly not homophobic. I\u0027m an ally of the LGBT community and I always have been.\u0027The jury took just 90 minutes to acquit Miss Clarke, who has joined calls for the MP to resign from the front bench, claiming working for Mrs Harris left her a \u0027nervous wreck\u0027 on antidepressants.          Miss Clarke claims she was assaulted in November 2014 when Mrs Harris began rubbing her shoulders before grabbing her hair and violently shaking her head backwards and forwards\u0027I gave nine years of loyalty to Carolyn, but she never showed me any of the respect I watched her give to the marchers at Spring Pride,\u0027 she says.Sitting in the two-bedroom council maisonette she shares with daughter Rachael, 22, tears well up as she recalls how her dream job turned sour, ending with her arrest and the threat of up to two years in jail.\u0027All I\u0027m guilty of is being naive and stupid,\u0027 she says. \u0027Nothing happened in that office that Carolyn didn\u0027t know about. She called me her \u0027office angel\u0027, but working for her felt like being in the Army. Sometimes I felt more like a slave than an employee.\u0027If I could go back, I\u0027d insist on doing everything by the book, but I put up and shut up because I was a single parent and I didn\u0027t want to lose a well-paid job.\u0027Miss Clarke was a mature student at Swansea University, reading social sciences and criminology, when she became a part-time aide for the then Swansea East MP, Sian James, in September 2008.          Senior party members are calling on Mrs Harris to quit — or for Mr Corbyn to suspend her from the frontbench — over the allegations and she is also facing calls for an investigation into the alleged assaultShe worked as case worker in the busy office, dealing with constituents\u0027 problems. A life-long Labour supporter, she loved her new job.Heading the small team was Carolyn Harris, who was office manager. From the start, Miss Clarke — who saw little of MP Mrs James, who was often in the House of Commons — says she found Mrs Harris \u0027forceful, loud, abrupt, bossy and lacking in tact\u0027.Single mother Miss Clarke had split from her male partner of 17 years when their daughter was five. In 2010, she started her first gay relationship with neighbour Rihanna Power, 32, who she\u0027s still with. \u0027When I met Rhianna, something just clicked,\u0027 she says. \u0027I was the happiest I\u0027d ever been in a relationship.\u0027In 2011, during a meeting to discuss work performance, Miss Clarke decided to confide in Mrs Harris: \u0027It was no one else\u0027s business, but the very next day in the office Carolyn started going on about how I had some news for everyone,\u0027 she says.\u0027My colleagues kept asking: \u0027What is it, Jen?\u0027 I felt goaded into revealing I was in a gay relationship. One colleague rolled her eyes and said: \u0027Is that it? I thought you were going to say you had cancer, the way Carolyn was going on.\u0027 \u0027Then, Miss Clarke claims, Mrs Harris\u0027s comments about her appearance started. \u0027When I started working there, I was always smart, but after a while I started dressing in more relaxed clothes, sometimes in jeans,\u0027 says Miss Clarke.\u0027One day I came in and Carolyn said: \u0027Look at you in your dyke boots.\u0027 Then to everyone else, she said: \u0027Jen has her dyke boots on today.\u0027\u0027I was absolutely mortified — embarrassed rather than angry, so I just sat at my desk, kept my head down and tried to ignore it.\u0027It was said in a jokey voice, and perhaps she didn\u0027t realise it had upset me, but it\u0027s moonshine for her to suggest we were all sitting around laughing and exchanging banter.\u0027Former MP Sian James told the jury Miss Clarke had raised the issue with her in 2013, upset over references to her clothing and the use of the word \u0027dyke\u0027, which she found offensive.\u0027She was starting to feel it had gone beyond banter and it was causing her concern,\u0027 she said, adding that the matter was addressed informally.\u0027She (Mrs Harris) was very shocked. She was very concerned that these comments, made within the atmosphere of the office, had caused hurt to Jenny. Both of them were very keen that the issue was addressed.\u0027Certainly, Miss Clarke never considered leaving her job, believing the matter had been resolved.She does not deny that Mrs Harris could be nice, too, giving her holidays in her mother\u0027s caravan, a TV and a car — but she felt such kindnesses came with strings attached. She says the favours left her feeling indebted and \u0027manipulated\u0027 into being at her boss\u0027s \u0027beck and call\u0027 — offering to clean the caravan, mow lawns and build furniture for Mrs Harris\u0027s son.Then, in November 2014, came the alleged assault, which Miss Clarke says she is still struggling to understand. Mrs Harris insists the allegation is untrue. She believes it was made as a result of jealousy caused by her selection to succeed Mrs James as the MP, after she stepped down in May 2015.\u0027I was sitting at my desk typing, when Carolyn walked past and started rubbing my shoulders,\u0027 claims Miss Clarke.\u0027Suddenly I felt her hands grip my hair and start moving my head violently backwards and forwards. I screamed: \u0027What are you doing? Get off!\u0027 I had to grip onto her hands to let go. It hurt like hell.\u0027It was as if she just flipped. When I challenged her, she dropped to her knees and kept saying how sorry she was, and how she loved me more than her son. She just couldn\u0027t explain it.\u0027I wish I\u0027d gone to the police then, but she was crying and seemed so sorry. It was Sian\u0027s last few months as an MP before standing down, and I didn\u0027t want to ruin things for her, so I decided to let it drop, but that night I couldn\u0027t sleep I was in so much pain and had to hold ice packs to my head.\u0027Paulette Smith, a Labour councillor who worked in the office at the time of the alleged assault — or a disaffected former employee in the eyes of Mrs Harris — told the jury she had witnessed the alleged assault. She spoke of a \u0027blood-curdling scream\u0027 and seeing Mrs Harris\u0027s hands, with tufts of Miss Clarke\u0027s hair in them. \u0027Jen was in agony,\u0027 she said.Nevertheless, when Mrs Harris was elected MP, Miss Clarke agreed to become office manager.\u0027Carolyn\u0027s ego went through the roof. Suddenly it felt like being in the Army. She wanted us to sign in, she wanted calls recorded, she wanted to know everything that was happening,\u0027 says Miss Clarke.\u0027One day I was sorting out pay rise forms for her, and Carolyn said to me: \u0027Give yourself an extra £2,000 while you are at it,\u0027 so stupidly I took her at her word and did just that.\u0027It wasn\u0027t forgery, I didn\u0027t try to copy Carolyn\u0027s signature, I just wrote her name just as I\u0027d done on countless other documents.\u0027Without telling her boss, Miss Clarke also reduced her hours to bring them in line with colleagues after noticing a discrepancy.\u0027It was stupid, but I knew Ipsa would email Mrs Harris for confirmation and she\u0027d see it then. She seemed fine with it. It was agreed I\u0027d send the confirmation back.\u0027 Mrs Harris denied this in court or authorising the pay rise. Demoted and then dismissed in January 2016, for unrelated matters, Miss Clarke lodged a grievance and decided to make a complaint to the police about the alleged assault two years earlier — but falling outside time limits, no action was taken.Last weekend, the BBC reported that Jeremy Corbyn and First Minister Carwyn Jones were both fully supporting Mrs Harris.But some Labour members of the Welsh Assembly and senior party members are calling on her to quit — or for Mr Corbyn to suspend her from the frontbench — over the allegations.She is also facing calls for a Labour investigation into the alleged assault.National Executive Committee member John Lansman said last week: \u0027I don\u0027t believe that Carolyn Harris can continue as a frontbench spokesperson on equalities when she has been accused in open court with supportive evidence of having used homophobic language.\u0027I think she needs to be removed from her role and in my view there must be an immediate investigation of the alleged assault.\u0027Welsh Government Environment Minister Hannah Blythyn, one of three LGBT politicians elected to the Assembly in 2016, said in a tweet: \u0027It\u0027s never banter — it\u0027s homophobic language.\u0027In a statement released by Mrs Harris\u0027s parliamentary office after Miss Clarke\u0027s acquittal, the MP said: \u0027When I uncovered evidence of wrongdoing in my office, I immediately reported it to the relevant authorities.\u0027However, in this instance the jury found the case was not provable beyond reasonable doubt.

Experts at the University of Warwick said the hard-sell language and tactics used by the gambling companies created the impression that viewers should rush to have a betThe researchers in applied psychology were also concerned that some adverts were designed in such a way that punters were likely to misjudge the probabilities of winning. One bookmaker advertised a bet ahead on England versus Tunisia, which included: \u0027England to win by three or more goals, Harry Kane to score, and over 11 corners\u0027. The odds were 16-to-1, but customers would only win if all three elements turned out to be correct.The academics said because each part of the bet feels likely to happen, people overestimate the chances of all three elements occurring. In fact, anyone who took up the bet lost, because while Harry Kane scored twice, England only won by a single goal margin. Betting firm William Hill warns it may have to close 900...Betting firms who target youngsters in adverts will face...Share this articlePrevious research by the group found these bets come in less often than fans think and have very high profit margins for the bookies.The research report entitled \u0027Impulsiveness and urgency: Gambling advertising and the 2018 soccer World Cup\u0027 was written by Dr Philip Newall, Mr Ankush Thobhani, Dr Lukasz Walasek and Professor Caroline Meyer.Dr Newall said: \u0027Technology and legislation have transformed the UK\u0027s gambling scene.

Struggling to cope: Trolleys in NHS corridors as shown in the BBC series HospitalHealth bosses say the NHS is in the midst of a ‘summer crisis’ with soaring temperatures leaving hospitals running at ‘boiling point all year round’.Nick Scriven, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said the heatwave had led to increases in attendances and admissions in those suffering from dehydration, particularly the frail elderly.He warned the increased pressure on services was likely to be bad news for the coming winter, when trusts face their busiest time.‘The summer months are traditionally the time acute hospitals and frontline staff have to recharge the batteries – this year we have had no respite and draining conditions,’ he said.The surge in attendances has been blamed for worsening waiting times, with more than 4.3 million patients waiting to start treatment.Urgent referrals for cancer treatment have now been breached for 30 months in a row, with just 79.2 per cent of patients seen within 62 days – well below the target of 85 per cent.In A\u0026ampE, the number of patients being seen within four hours fell to 89.3 per cent, compared to 90.7 per cent in June and 90.3 per cent in July 2017.Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said: ‘The summer has provided no respite for NHS staff who are now working flat out to meet unsustainable levels of demand both in the summer and the winter. This is a symptom of an NHS running at boiling point all year round.’ NHS England said: ‘As temperatures soared, the NHS saw an unprecedented summer surge last month.‘Thanks to the hard work of staff, nine in ten people were seen, treated and admitted or discharged within four hours.’÷ Nearly a fifth of children and young people referred for an eating disorder wait four weeks or longer for treatment, according to figures yesterday.The share of ordinary cases being seen within four weeks – the NHS target waiting time – was 79.9 per cent in the three months between April and June.

He has swum in a glacial lake on Everest and braved the freezing waters off Antarctica. He was the first person to complete a long-distance swim in all five of Earth\u0027s oceans, and has swum the length of the Thames. And now he aims to become the first person to swim the full length of the Channel — that\u0027s 330 miles.The narrowest distance across the Channel is a mere 22 miles. Since Captain Matthew Webb became the first person to swim it in 1875 (though he went off course and ended up swimming 39 miles), 1,800 people have emulated him, including Pugh in 1992.But no one has ever swum its full length — the equivalent of 15 Channel crossings, from Land\u0027s End to Dover, in just cap, goggles and swimming trunks.          United Nations Environment Programme Patron of the Oceans Lewis Pugh at the Speedo and Surfers Against Sewage Marazion Beach Clean UpUnder Channel Swimming Association rules, that — plus as much grease as he wants — is all Pugh is allowed to wear. He mustn\u0027t touch his support boat, the Aquila, during his daily swims, or ever swim behind it or behind another person, because he might then benefit from the slipstream.Pugh started at Land\u0027s End on July 12 and after 28 days has completed about 180 miles, following the coastline at a distance and generally, when not swimming, spending all his time on the support boat, which must drop anchor whenever he finishes a swim.

He has also been struggling with a shoulder injury and yesterday saw a physiotherapist at AFC Bournemouth.So why is he doing it?

It took on its current name in 1941. In 1985 it was bought out by the Fayed brothers, the owners of Harrods, for £615million, who floated the company on the London stock exchange began a major refurbishment of the department store.The chain launched online in 2007 and opened its first international store in 2013 in Abu Dhabi.House of Fraser\u0027s current owner - the Chinese conglomerate Sanpower Group - bought 89 per cent of the department store in September 2014 for £480million.  After disappointing Christmas sales last year it announced it would close failing stores and reduce the size of others, beginning the latest chain of financial rescue efforts.        "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/10/09/4EFB6B9000000578-0-image-m-11_1533888097957.jpg","title":"100 year old message bottle discovery reveals epic tale Londoners quest adventure","story":"    The message in the bottle (pictured) read: ‘Hugh Craggs, Yacht St George RTYC.

He said he could not remember flicking his cigarette butt at them or knocking Ali unconscious a short time later.Stokes insisted Ali was aggressive and homophobic towards Mr O\u0027Connor and Mr Barry.\u0027He was aggressive and violent towards me in what he said but he was definitely verbally aggressive with Mr Barry and Mr O\u0027Connor,\u0027 Stokes said. \u0027It\u0027s clearly in my statement that I admit to throwing multiple punches. At the time of that situation, I constantly felt under threat from Mr Ali.\u0027Stokes was asked about what Ali was doing in the moments before he knocked him out and he said he could not remember.Mr Corsellis asked: \u0027Is it because you are hiding behind your lack of recollection because you know full well you carried out a retaliatory attack upon those two men, first Mr Hale and then Mr Ali?\u0027Stokes replied: \u0027No, all my actions were in self-defence and fearing for my safety.\u0027Yesterday, the cricketer told Bristol Crown Court: \u0027I initially got involved with a verbal altercation which then turned into an attack which did involve weapons – a glass bottle was used as a weapon – which then turned into a fight.\u0027Throughout the whole time that I was using any force it was in the complete belief that these two gentlemen – who I had never met before – were willing to use weapons again as they had already. \u0027I didn\u0027t know ... they could be carrying more weapons on them. They could decide to attack me at any time if I was to turn my back on either of these two. \u0027While these two were in front of me I wasn\u0027t going to let any opportunity to let these two iniduals have that opportunity towards me. At all times I felt under threat from these two.\u0027Having been denied entry to a Bristol nightclub, Stokes and his England teammate Alex Hales – out celebrating a team win – started walking to a casino, the court heard. They encountered Hale and Ali around the corner. Stokes claimed he overheard them using homophobic language against Mr Barry and Mr O\u0027Connor, although he couldn\u0027t remember the words used.    Stokes and teammate Alex Hales were together (pictured on the night) after celebrating with the England cricket team, who had just beaten the West Indies in a one-day international\u0027I was trying to stop Mr Ali from doing damage to anyone with a glass bottle.\u0027 Stokes denied taunting Mr Barry and Mr O\u0027Connor, insisting he was the one being mocked for his designer trainers and his admitted questionable fashion sense. The prosecution has accused Stokes of mimicking the flamboyant pair\u0027s \u0027camp\u0027 mannerisms minutes before he \u0027lost control\u0027 and the brawl broke out.Jurors were yesterday shown the Buscemi high-top trainers that Stokes was wearing in the early hours of September 25 last year. The white Italian leather shoes, which feature a gold padlock on each heel, were held aloft by defence solicitor Gordon Cole QC.Stokes, a father of two who plays county cricket for Durham, told jurors: \u0027My attire on that night got mentioned. It was one of the gay couple.\u0027I get told by quite a lot of my teammates that I dress the worst in the team. We both exchanged comments about what one another were wearing.\u0027 Wearing a white shirt with a light blue shirt and tie as he took the stand yesterday, Stokes was watched by wife Clare Ratcliffe from the front row of the public gallery. Stokes said he drank at least ten alcoholic drinks on the night of the incident, including two or three pints of lager and at least seven vodka-lemonades.Asked by Mr Cole if he was homophobic, Stokes said: \u0027No, absolutely not. The only comments between myself and the gay couple was what we had chosen to wear that night.\u0027He also denied humiliating nightclub doorman Andrew Cunningham, who said he and Hales couldn\u0027t come in, adding: \u0027I didn\u0027t use the c-word towards him. I said to him \u0027come on mate, I\u0027ve got s*** tattoos as well, let us back in\u0027.\u0027              Stokes starred in the cricket last week (pictured) as England beat India at EdgbastonMr Cole asked Stokes: \u0027At any stage had you become enraged for any reason at all in the incident you had been involved with, from leaving Mbargo?\u0027Stokes replied: \u0027I find it a difficult question to answer.\u0027He also said he could not remember who he contacted following his arrest. He told jurors: \u0027I was stuck in a bit of a problem as I wasn\u0027t sure who was the best person to contact. \u0027Being a cricket player, I have a manager who looks after my stuff. I also had a fiancee who I was pretty sure needed to be contacted. I can\u0027t actually remember who was contacted.\u0027Stokes, of Castle Eden, Durham, and Ali, of Bristol, both deny affray.

She’s also a very beautiful, very famous and very successful movie star who for the past 12 years has been married to a very handsome, very famous and very successful movie star  Angelina Jolie always like to remind us she\u0027s \u0027more\u0027 than an actress. She’s a Special Envoy for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, regularly embarking on trips to war-torn countriesEXCLUSIVE: Rosé-colored glasses! Brad and Angelina\u0027s Chateau...Brad Pitt is pictured at law office amid bitter custody...Share this article    This week Angelina launched a savage public attack on her husband Brad Pitt, the father to their six children. The message was crystal clear: Brad’s a deadbeat dad. Furious Pitt hit back immediately, saying he’d loaned his wife $8 million for a house in which to live with their children, and given her $1.3 million for bills. That’s a lot of money for 18 months of childcareFriends told the New York Post he had fulfilled all financial obligations to his kids, including payments for therapists, travel expenses and round-the-clock bodyguards.The friends added that Jolie is being ‘ridiculously unreasonable’ and is ‘fuelled by anger’.They also said how hurt Pitt is by her decision to make this damning ‘deadbeat dad’ allegation in open court rather than in front of a private judge as the rest of the orce has so far been heard.I’m sure he is.It’s hard to imagine a worse thing for any father to be accused of then failing to take proper care of his children.It’s also hard to imagine a worse thing for any child than reading, or seeing on TV, that their father is a mean tightwad who refuses to take responsibility for them.In any orce, a lot of mud gets slung.No marriage ends happily, whatever absurd PR spin some celebrity couples try to put on their ‘conscious uncoupling’.But when children are involved, the right thing to do, indeed the imperative thing to do, is to keep the mudslinging behind closed doors.If you’re going to shout insults at each other, do it when the kids can’t hear it.If you want to make very damaging legal claims about each other, then don’t do it in open court.This is particularly important for anyone famous because once this stuff gets into the public domain, then it stays there for your children to read for the rest of their lives.Angelina Jolie knows this better than anyone, as she’s now been married three times.  Angelina should know that once it\u0027s in the public domain it\u0027s there for your children to read forever. She\u0027e been married three times (seen here with first husband Johnny Lee Miller) and she lived through her own famous parents\u0027 bitter orce after Jon Voight cheatedShe also knows from her own parents’ bitter orce (her mother Marcheline Bertrand left her father Jon Voight when Angelina was a toddler, after he cheated) how scarring it can be to have lurid details of your parents’ break-up set in permanent internet stone.So why would she decide to publicly humiliate her own children’s father like this?And why would she further compound the children’s unhappiness by making it hard for him to see them when he wants to?Unlike most ‘deadbeat dads’, Pitt has been fighting to see more, not less of his kids.But Jolie has apparently been resisting this so vigorously that the orce judge reportedly warned her in June to stop it or risk losing primary custody.He was also said to have ordered her to provide Pitt with a cell phone number for each child, to allow him to call whenever he wants, barred her from reading the children’s text messages from their father, and laid out a summer schedule for each child to see him.I don’t know the truth about what’s gone wrong in the Brangelina marriage – only they do.          So why would she decide to publicly humiliate her own children’s father like this?  Unlike most ‘deadbeat dads’, Pitt has been fighting to see more, not less of his kids. But Jolie has apparently been resisting this vigorously. I don\u0027t know why Angelina is now behaving in such an irrational and vicious mannerBy his own admission, Brad wasn’t a perfect father or husband and seemed to have hit some kind of mid-life crisis by the time they split.Nor do I know why Angelina is now behaving in such an irrational and vicious manner. Though some fear her rage may not be entirely unconnected to the fact his new girlfriend is a stunning and brilliantly clever MIT professor, Neri Oxman.However, what I do know is that Angelina’s decision to publicly attack him this week can only turn out to be incredibly damaging to their children.And it sits very uneasily with her claim that those children ‘will always come first’.But then what Angelina says and does are often two very different things.For example, she once said: ‘To be intimate with a married men, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn’t be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.’Then she fell in love with Jennifer Anniston’s husband Brad Pitt on the film Mr and Mrs Smith, and stole him from her.So Angelina’s halo, which she ruthlessly ensures has an almost permanent glisten to it, may not shine quite so brightly when she looks away from the mirror.There’s also another weird aspect to her court action this week.Angelina Jolie has always proudly affirmed herself as a tough, independent woman who doesn’t need a man to help her get on in life.           Angelina’s halo may not shine quite so brightly anymore . Also, she\u0027s always proudly affirmed herself as a tough, independent woman who doesn’t need a man to help her get on in life. So WHY now look so grasping, whining, needy and man-reliant?The true embodiment, you might think, of modern feminism.And she’s been remarkably successful at it, making more money from movies and endorsements than almost any actress in history.So why would she now want to make herself look so grasping, whining, needy and man-reliant?If Angelina Jolie really thinks Brad Pitt is a useless deadbeat dad, then what better way to prove it then to tell him to stuff his money where the sun don’t shine and provide for her kids herself?She can certainly easily afford to if she wishes.Instead, she’s chosen to deliberately, and what may well be falsely, embarrass the father of her children in public.That’s such a weak, cheap shot Angelina – especially for a humanitarian who says she always puts her children first."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/09/21/4EF7CB1B00000578-6044943-image-m-96_1533845108363.jpg","title":"Labours equalities minister accused outing aide gay saying wears dyke boots","story":"    Jenny Lee Clarke, who was Labour minister\u0027s aide, was cleared of forgery and fraud, Miss Clarke claimed in court that the MP had quizzed her on her sex life made fun of her \u0027dyke\u0027 boots and outed her as gay to colleagues\u0027Labour are committed to making sure our LGBT community get all the rights and respect they deserve,\u0027 she said in a YouTube video.\u0027I\u0027m very proud to be here in my home city and am looking forward to a glorious day with my friends, and people who have come from wide and far to help us celebrate ersity.\u0027It\u0027s hard to reconcile that image with the one of Mrs Harris painted by her gay former aide. Today, Mrs Harris\u0027s political career appears to hang in the balance, as senior party members call for her to be sacked over courtroom allegations — made by Jenny Lee Clarke — that she is a \u0027homophobic bully\u0027.It must be said at the outset that Mrs Harris — a political \u0027rags-to-riches\u0027 success story, who once worked as a school dinner lady and rose to the highest ranks in Westminster — vehemently denies these allegations.          Carolyn Harris, Welsh deputy leader, vehemnetly denies the accusations and described a \u0027lovely\u0027 office atmosphere filled with \u0027banter\u0027, where colleagues were friends who laughed and talked about \u0027anything and everything\u0027          The \u0027dyke boots\u0027 that Miss Clarke wore to work were ridiculed by her boss, Mrs Harris says she does not remember saying anything and if she did it would have been \u0027banter\u0027They were made during the trial of Miss Clarke, her former constituency office manager, on fraud and forgery charges. Last week, Miss Clarke was cleared at Cardiff Crown Court after being accused of awarding herself a £2,000 pay rise and cutting her work hours without her boss\u0027s authority.Miss Clarke, 42, had been accused of forging Mrs Harris\u0027s signature on a form, submitted to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) in August 2015, increasing her £37,000-a-year salary and reducing her 40-hour working week to 37.5 hours.When Ipsa sent a confidential email to Mrs Harris to confirm the change, the prosecution claimed Miss Clarke accessed the MP\u0027s account and replied: \u0027Yes, this is correct.\u0027 Furious Tory MP accuses No10 of launching a ¿witch hunt¿...Corbyn \u0027handed ultimatum by powerful backers Momentum who...Share this articleBut Miss Clarke insisted she was following Mrs Harris\u0027s verbal instructions, claiming it was common practice for her to sign forms on behalf of the \u0027over-bearing\u0027 MP, whom, she said, \u0027detested paperwork\u0027.Indeed, the picture Miss Clarke painted of a highly dysfunctional office — hotly disputed by the MP — raises questions about Carolyn Harris\u0027s suitability for the Shadow front bench role.For Miss Clarke claimed in court that the MP had also \u0027outed\u0027 her to colleagues, after she confided in Mrs Harris she was gay in 2011, quizzed her on her sex life and made fun of her \u0027dyke\u0027 boots.          Miss Clarke says working for Mrs Harris felt like being in the \u0027Army\u0027 and that she felt \u0027more like a slave than an employee\u0027Here, in her first interview since she was cleared, Miss Clarke reveals she, too, was at the Swansea Pride event — and hid from her former boss.\u0027I felt sick when I saw her dancing, waving her arms and laughing with people at the parade. I was so overwhelmed by anxiety, I was shaking,\u0027 says Miss Clarke.\u0027From the day I confided in her that I was in a gay relationship, her attitude towards me seemed to change overnight.\u0027Miss Clarke also alleged in court that in November 2014, Mrs Harris had grabbed her by the hair as she sat at her desk, violently shaking her head — a claim strenuously denied by the MPInstead, Mrs Harris described a \u0027lovely\u0027 office atmosphere filled with \u0027banter\u0027, where colleagues were friends who laughed and talked about \u0027anything and everything\u0027.As for the reference to \u0027dyke\u0027 boots, she said: \u0027I don\u0027t remember saying that, but if I did, it would have been banter. I\u0027m certainly not homophobic. I\u0027m an ally of the LGBT community and I always have been.\u0027The jury took just 90 minutes to acquit Miss Clarke, who has joined calls for the MP to resign from the front bench, claiming working for Mrs Harris left her a \u0027nervous wreck\u0027 on antidepressants.          Miss Clarke claims she was assaulted in November 2014 when Mrs Harris began rubbing her shoulders before grabbing her hair and violently shaking her head backwards and forwards\u0027I gave nine years of loyalty to Carolyn, but she never showed me any of the respect I watched her give to the marchers at Spring Pride,\u0027 she says.Sitting in the two-bedroom council maisonette she shares with daughter Rachael, 22, tears well up as she recalls how her dream job turned sour, ending with her arrest and the threat of up to two years in jail.\u0027All I\u0027m guilty of is being naive and stupid,\u0027 she says. \u0027Nothing happened in that office that Carolyn didn\u0027t know about. She called me her \u0027office angel\u0027, but working for her felt like being in the Army. Sometimes I felt more like a slave than an employee.\u0027If I could go back, I\u0027d insist on doing everything by the book, but I put up and shut up because I was a single parent and I didn\u0027t want to lose a well-paid job.\u0027Miss Clarke was a mature student at Swansea University, reading social sciences and criminology, when she became a part-time aide for the then Swansea East MP, Sian James, in September 2008.          Senior party members are calling on Mrs Harris to quit — or for Mr Corbyn to suspend her from the frontbench — over the allegations and she is also facing calls for an investigation into the alleged assaultShe worked as case worker in the busy office, dealing with constituents\u0027 problems. A life-long Labour supporter, she loved her new job.Heading the small team was Carolyn Harris, who was office manager. From the start, Miss Clarke — who saw little of MP Mrs James, who was often in the House of Commons — says she found Mrs Harris \u0027forceful, loud, abrupt, bossy and lacking in tact\u0027.Single mother Miss Clarke had split from her male partner of 17 years when their daughter was five. In 2010, she started her first gay relationship with neighbour Rihanna Power, 32, who she\u0027s still with. \u0027When I met Rhianna, something just clicked,\u0027 she says. \u0027I was the happiest I\u0027d ever been in a relationship.\u0027In 2011, during a meeting to discuss work performance, Miss Clarke decided to confide in Mrs Harris: \u0027It was no one else\u0027s business, but the very next day in the office Carolyn started going on about how I had some news for everyone,\u0027 she says.\u0027My colleagues kept asking: \u0027What is it, Jen?\u0027 I felt goaded into revealing I was in a gay relationship. One colleague rolled her eyes and said: \u0027Is that it? I thought you were going to say you had cancer, the way Carolyn was going on.\u0027 \u0027Then, Miss Clarke claims, Mrs Harris\u0027s comments about her appearance started. \u0027When I started working there, I was always smart, but after a while I started dressing in more relaxed clothes, sometimes in jeans,\u0027 says Miss Clarke.\u0027One day I came in and Carolyn said: \u0027Look at you in your dyke boots.\u0027 Then to everyone else, she said: \u0027Jen has her dyke boots on today.\u0027\u0027I was absolutely mortified — embarrassed rather than angry, so I just sat at my desk, kept my head down and tried to ignore it.\u0027It was said in a jokey voice, and perhaps she didn\u0027t realise it had upset me, but it\u0027s moonshine for her to suggest we were all sitting around laughing and exchanging banter.\u0027Former MP Sian James told the jury Miss Clarke had raised the issue with her in 2013, upset over references to her clothing and the use of the word \u0027dyke\u0027, which she found offensive.\u0027She was starting to feel it had gone beyond banter and it was causing her concern,\u0027 she said, adding that the matter was addressed informally.\u0027She (Mrs Harris) was very shocked. She was very concerned that these comments, made within the atmosphere of the office, had caused hurt to Jenny. Both of them were very keen that the issue was addressed.\u0027Certainly, Miss Clarke never considered leaving her job, believing the matter had been resolved.She does not deny that Mrs Harris could be nice, too, giving her holidays in her mother\u0027s caravan, a TV and a car — but she felt such kindnesses came with strings attached. She says the favours left her feeling indebted and \u0027manipulated\u0027 into being at her boss\u0027s \u0027beck and call\u0027 — offering to clean the caravan, mow lawns and build furniture for Mrs Harris\u0027s son.Then, in November 2014, came the alleged assault, which Miss Clarke says she is still struggling to understand. Mrs Harris insists the allegation is untrue. She believes it was made as a result of jealousy caused by her selection to succeed Mrs James as the MP, after she stepped down in May 2015.\u0027I was sitting at my desk typing, when Carolyn walked past and started rubbing my shoulders,\u0027 claims Miss Clarke.\u0027Suddenly I felt her hands grip my hair and start moving my head violently backwards and forwards. I screamed: \u0027What are you doing? Get off!\u0027 I had to grip onto her hands to let go. It hurt like hell.\u0027It was as if she just flipped. When I challenged her, she dropped to her knees and kept saying how sorry she was, and how she loved me more than her son. She just couldn\u0027t explain it.\u0027I wish I\u0027d gone to the police then, but she was crying and seemed so sorry. It was Sian\u0027s last few months as an MP before standing down, and I didn\u0027t want to ruin things for her, so I decided to let it drop, but that night I couldn\u0027t sleep I was in so much pain and had to hold ice packs to my head.\u0027Paulette Smith, a Labour councillor who worked in the office at the time of the alleged assault — or a disaffected former employee in the eyes of Mrs Harris — told the jury she had witnessed the alleged assault. She spoke of a \u0027blood-curdling scream\u0027 and seeing Mrs Harris\u0027s hands, with tufts of Miss Clarke\u0027s hair in them. \u0027Jen was in agony,\u0027 she said.Nevertheless, when Mrs Harris was elected MP, Miss Clarke agreed to become office manager.\u0027Carolyn\u0027s ego went through the roof. Suddenly it felt like being in the Army. She wanted us to sign in, she wanted calls recorded, she wanted to know everything that was happening,\u0027 says Miss Clarke.\u0027One day I was sorting out pay rise forms for her, and Carolyn said to me: \u0027Give yourself an extra £2,000 while you are at it,\u0027 so stupidly I took her at her word and did just that.\u0027It wasn\u0027t forgery, I didn\u0027t try to copy Carolyn\u0027s signature, I just wrote her name just as I\u0027d done on countless other documents.\u0027Without telling her boss, Miss Clarke also reduced her hours to bring them in line with colleagues after noticing a discrepancy.\u0027It was stupid, but I knew Ipsa would email Mrs Harris for confirmation and she\u0027d see it then. She seemed fine with it. It was agreed I\u0027d send the confirmation back.\u0027 Mrs Harris denied this in court or authorising the pay rise. Demoted and then dismissed in January 2016, for unrelated matters, Miss Clarke lodged a grievance and decided to make a complaint to the police about the alleged assault two years earlier — but falling outside time limits, no action was taken.Last weekend, the BBC reported that Jeremy Corbyn and First Minister Carwyn Jones were both fully supporting Mrs Harris.But some Labour members of the Welsh Assembly and senior party members are calling on her to quit — or for Mr Corbyn to suspend her from the frontbench — over the allegations.She is also facing calls for a Labour investigation into the alleged assault.National Executive Committee member John Lansman said last week: \u0027I don\u0027t believe that Carolyn Harris can continue as a frontbench spokesperson on equalities when she has been accused in open court with supportive evidence of having used homophobic language.\u0027I think she needs to be removed from her role and in my view there must be an immediate investigation of the alleged assault.\u0027Welsh Government Environment Minister Hannah Blythyn, one of three LGBT politicians elected to the Assembly in 2016, said in a tweet: \u0027It\u0027s never banter — it\u0027s homophobic language.\u0027In a statement released by Mrs Harris\u0027s parliamentary office after Miss Clarke\u0027s acquittal, the MP said: \u0027When I uncovered evidence of wrongdoing in my office, I immediately reported it to the relevant authorities.\u0027However, in this instance the jury found the case was not provable beyond reasonable doubt. It goes without saying that I respect the process of justice.\u0027 But, as criticism mounted over her use of the word \u0027banter\u0027 in her evidence, an apologetic Mrs Harris responded: \u0027I understand that banter was an entirely inappropriate, indeed offensive, word to use.\u0027I honestly do not remember making such a comment, and hearing it alleged in court struck me to the core.\u0027It is a word that many LGBT people have heard to justify homophobic abuse for too long. And I apologise — unreservedly and unequivocally — for my use of it.\u0027Miss Clarke, who is still unemployed, is planning to lodge a complaint with Ipsa and the Labour Party, says: \u0027That\u0027s all well and good, but where\u0027s my apology?\u0027For nine years I was loyal to Carolyn and kept quiet, but not any more. She has to go.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/09/23/4EECC4F600000578-6045215-image-a-16_1533853461711.jpg","title":"Academics call ban live odds gambling ads commercials World Cup misled viewers","story":"    At least some of the commercials could have contravened new marketing codes designed by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) to protect the publicThey said this same tactic will be used around Premier League matches starting this weekend and, such are the \u0027significant concerns\u0027 about the impact on punters, it may be necessary to ban all \u0027live odds\u0027 commercials.The team said the use of this type of commercial appears to the against the spirit of ASA guidance, which came into force in April and covers the issues of \u0027impulsiveness and urgency\u0027.The ASA\u0027s code states: \u0027In order not to encourage gambling behaviour that is irresponsible, marketing communications should not unduly pressure the audience to gamble, especially when gambling opportunities offered are subject to a significant time limitation.\u0027 The researchers tracked the frequency and content of \u0027live-odds\u0027 TV adverts shown during all 32 World Cup matches on ITV, with a particular interest in advertising around the England games.

Experts at the University of Warwick said the hard-sell language and tactics used by the gambling companies created the impression that viewers should rush to have a betThe researchers in applied psychology were also concerned that some adverts were designed in such a way that punters were likely to misjudge the probabilities of winning. One bookmaker advertised a bet ahead on England versus Tunisia, which included: \u0027England to win by three or more goals, Harry Kane to score, and over 11 corners\u0027. The odds were 16-to-1, but customers would only win if all three elements turned out to be correct.The academics said because each part of the bet feels likely to happen, people overestimate the chances of all three elements occurring. In fact, anyone who took up the bet lost, because while Harry Kane scored twice, England only won by a single goal margin. Betting firm William Hill warns it may have to close 900...Betting firms who target youngsters in adverts will face...Share this articlePrevious research by the group found these bets come in less often than fans think and have very high profit margins for the bookies.The research report entitled \u0027Impulsiveness and urgency: Gambling advertising and the 2018 soccer World Cup\u0027 was written by Dr Philip Newall, Mr Ankush Thobhani, Dr Lukasz Walasek and Professor Caroline Meyer.Dr Newall said: \u0027Technology and legislation have transformed the UK\u0027s gambling scene.

And now he aims to become the first person to swim the full length of the Channel — that\u0027s 330 miles.The narrowest distance across the Channel is a mere 22 miles. Since Captain Matthew Webb became the first person to swim it in 1875 (though he went off course and ended up swimming 39 miles), 1,800 people have emulated him, including Pugh in 1992.But no one has ever swum its full length — the equivalent of 15 Channel crossings, from Land\u0027s End to Dover, in just cap, goggles and swimming trunks.

Now, the author of The Snap talks risk-taking, genre snobbery and not needing to know whodunnitBelinda Bauer heard the news that she’d been longlisted for this year’s Man Booker prize for her thriller Snap from her agent and editor, who called her together from the Harrogate crime writing festival, giggling so hard she could hardly tell what they were saying. Sworn to secrecy, she kept thinking she must have heard them wrong – she couldn’t quite believe it.A few days later, it was official: Snap, which is inspired by the murder of a pregnant woman, Marie Wilks, on the M50 in 1988 (the real-life crime remains unsolved), had become one of the very few crime-genre novels ever to be considered for the prize. The judges described it as “an acute, stylish, intelligent novel about how we survive trauma”, which “undermines the tropes of its own genre, and leaves us with something that lingers”. If it undermines the tropes of its genre, perhaps that’s because Bauer never set out to be a crime novelist. In fact, she says, she didn’t even realise that her 2010 debut, Blacklands – the story of a boy who enters into a dangerous correspondence with the imprisoned paedophile serial killer believed to have murdered his uncle – was a thriller at all.“I thought it was a book about a boy and his grandmother and there just happened to be a serial killer. Because the serial killer was already in prison, in my mind I was thinking: ‘Well, it’s not a whodunnit because we know whodunnit,’ so this is not a crime novel,” she says, in London for a Booker event before returning to her home near Cardiff. “For me it was all about the boy trying to heal his family relationships, with reference to a serial killer.”Bauer had worked as a journalist for an agency in Cardiff, and then as a screenwriter for seven years (“I’d failed miserably at that”), before she sat down, at the age of 45, to give novel writing a try.“Really I wrote the book to shut my mother up. She was nagging me for so many years, and I got so cross about it. I just thought: ‘At least I can show her something I’ve written. I keep telling her I’m a writer and she never sees anything I’ve written because the films aren’t getting made.’”She had enough money saved up to take a year out, and spent it writing Blacklands and a thriller called High Rollers, approaching them as she would a movie script, cutting and cutting, seeing the story unrolling like a film. Not a single publisher or agent would take a look at them.She worked for a friend’s gardening business, and took a six-month mortgage holiday. “All the time I was gardening and running out of money, and thinking to myself everything was going to be just fine. I don’t know why – it’s not like me. I’m very cautious.”In the last month of her mortgage holiday, a friend bought her a magazine with a competition in the back, for the Crime Writers’ Association debut dagger for unpublished writers. She didn’t win, but was shortlisted, which brought her to the attention of the agent Jane Gregory. After signing with Gregory, Blacklands sold within a week.“I was actually in Ikea when she called me and told me there was a bidding auction on the book. It really was amazing, I just felt so relieved more than anything. It’s just so unlike me to take a punt with my life and my money,” she says.So, having “never read anything that was actually marketed as a crime book”, she started out as a crime writer on “possibly a different footing to someone who was immersed in the genre”.Blacklands became one of the rare debuts to win the CWA golden dagger. Her next novels, Dark Side and Finders Keepers, follow crimes in the same Exmoor community.“The second book and the third I felt I was trying too hard to fit into the genre. It was a bit of a series, and I was trying to undermine the cliches, but at the same time I could feel myself becoming immersed in the tropes that were available to the genre,” says Bauer. “Dark Side and Finders Keepers are fine, but if I’d carried on going down that path I would have become very disillusioned, so that’s why I made a conscious decision to do something very different with my fourth book, Rubbernecker. I was really pleased I did, because it reaffirmed that you don’t have to conform to certain conventions in any genre.”About a medical student with Asperger’s who is out to solve a murder, Rubbernecker won the Theakston’s Old Peculier crime novel of the year prize. Bauer had been, despite initial misgivings, thoroughly assimilated into the crime-writing community.“Now I have so many ideas for books where obviously there is a crime in them, but that is not the point of the story … For me a book is always about the emotional journey. The plot is completely irrelevant as long as you can take people on that journey with you, say to them: ‘You know what? Terrible things are going to happen but if you trust me you’ll be emotionally satisfied.’ That’s why I’m not even interested in solving the crime, sometimes I don’t even care if you know what exactly happens or whodunnit. If you don’t love the characters, then who cares who did it, or if they got caught?”Snap opens with three children sitting in a sweltering car by the side of the motorway waiting for their mother to come back with help. When she doesn’t, 11-year-old Jack picks up the baby, Merry, and marshals his little sister Joy along the hard shoulder. Nobody stops. When they finally reach the emergency phone their mother set out to reach, it is dangling off the hook. Three years later, Jack is trying to keep up a facade of normality and stop his little sisters from being taken into care.“Those children were the starting point: that scene on the motorway,” says Bauer. Marie Wilks’s 11-year-old sister was found walking up the side of the M50, carrying Marie’s one-year-old son. “They walked up the hard shoulder on the motorway on a blazing hot day for miles, and not one single car stopped, this little girl carrying a baby. It haunted me for years and I wanted to use that as a kicking-off point.”Although Jack embarks on a dangerous game to find his mother’s killer, and although the police, in the form of the gloriously misanthropic DCI John Marvel, are pulled into the hunt, it was exploring the psychology of the children that Bauer found “most interesting”.“It fits into my style of writing, which is about young people, for the most part, involved in a crime. His mum says to him: ‘You’re in charge, Jack,’ as she walks away from the car, and three years later he’s still in charge, trying to keep all the balls in the air, everybody alive, hidden from the authorities, in this terrible house, which is now full of newspapers which his sister collects obsessively to try and find clues about his mother’s death.”Like Steven in Blacklands, Jack is the beating heart of Snap. He is a damaged, brave boy nearing adulthood, a time that holds a fascination for Bauer, which she attributes to Stephen King. Salem’s Lot, and its child protagonist, made a “lasting impression” on her when she read it at the age of 12. “It was so startling to me that there was this child, but it was a completely grownup book, and the child was solving the problems,” she says. “Without having read Salem’s Lot, I would never have written Blacklands the way I did.”Bauer has been an obsessive storyteller since she was a child, lying awake in bed and making up tales that she would pick up the next night. She lived in her own head so much that she would charge her sisters by the half-hour to play with her. “I could never get lost in a game with them because the story I was telling in my own head was better, so they were an interruption,” she says, grinning.Like many of the best writers about childhood, Bauer feels she has a complete recall of her own life back to a very young age. “When I was about seven or eight I remember thinking that grownups seem to have forgotten what it was like to be a child, and when I grow up I would never forget. I’ve always felt like that. Because I’ve never had children of my own I’ve been able and allowed and privileged to actually never let go of that, never have to move beyond it and become a grownup,” she says. “I’m so glad I have recall of it and relive it through these books. I know I put these children through hell. But when people ask me: ‘How could you do this to Steven or Jack?’ I say I never put these characters through more than they’re able to cope with, even though it may seem like that at the time. I really love them.”Bauer admits that she has had “some flak on Twitter” since the Booker longlisting. “‘How dare Belinda Bauer think she can be on this longlist?’ That sort of thing.” But she’s blissfully unbothered, and understands the snobbery around crime fiction, because she used to feel it. “I was a crime snob,” she says. But, first, “people are doing such incredible things inside this genre” second, “there are good and bad writers within any genre of fiction, literary as well as anything else” and third, if you think about it, “almost every book in history has a crime element to it”.She remains delighted by her longlisting. “If it’s tokenism, I don’t care, because it does so much not only for crime writers but for readers in general, because now hopefully some of them will be open to reading a different kind of book,” she says. “So many writers from other genres are jumping on the crime bandwagon, and I think it’s starting to find its place again, with people who love to read a good book and don’t care what it is. It’s just about marketing, and I wish people would understand that and pick up some good stuff and read it.”• Snap is published by Bantam.

It presses the mundane up against the magical, all wrapped up in dreamlike prose.The book I think is most overratedNaked Lunch by William S Burroughs. You’d be better off reading the underrated Ice by Anna Kavan, which also deals with drug addiction in a surrealist, hallucinatory way, but which is infinitely more beautiful and lucid.The book that changed my mindThe Piano Teacher by Elfriede Jelinek blew my mind when I read it, due to its approach to female desire. It’s a ferociously clever book about romantic obsession and masochism, treating subjects so often overlooked as hysterical with intellectual rigour, and it made me think: maybe I could do that too?The last book that made me cryFreshwater by Akwaeke Emezi isn’t out in the UK until November, but I’m already urging everyone to read it. It reimagines mental illness and disassociation through Igbo ontologies, following a character who was born with a foot on “the other side” and positioning their fractured personalities as various gods fighting for dominance. It was an intense reading experience and really affected me.The last book that made me laughHeartburn by Nora Ephron is hilarious and heartbreaking in equal measure. Every page has a brilliant one-liner or punchline. Also I want to cook my way through every recipe in the book.The book I couldn’t finishThe Bible. I tried to read it once but just … it’s really long.The book I’m most ashamed not to have readI’ve never read Wuthering Heights by Emily Brontë, even though I know it’s exactly my aesthetic – gothic, intense and eerie.My earliest reading memoryIn my house growing up there was always a battered copy of The Welsh Fairy Book by W Jenkyn Thomas. Stories of mysterious lights, of changelings, of women who lived in lakes and sunken cities. I used to drink them up.My reading guilty pleasureThere is a special place in my heart for the high melodrama of Jewels by Danielle Steel. I mean, a multi-decade saga that takes in a spirited debutante, feckless husbands, lavish trips around Europe, dukes and duchesses, war breaking out …The book I most often give as a giftAll My Puny Sorrows by Miriam Toews doesn’t seem at first like the best choice for a gift, dealing as it does\u0026nbspwith the struggle of the protagonist to prevent the suicide of her older sister.

Two years later they went further, signalling plans to open up to 80 stores together. As yet no stores have opened.An Arcadia spokesman confirmed the partnership had ended: “Topshop Topman and Chinese franchise partner Shangpin, have reached a mutual agreement to an early termination.” In December 2016 Green announced plans to embark on physical expansion with Shangpin, telling the Financial Times it was “the start of a unique, exciting and exclusive partnership that will cement Topshop and Topman’s mission of becoming truly global businesses”. The FT report said five stores would open in 2017 and if successful another 75 outlets could follow. The Topshop Topman spokesman added that it still considered China to be a “hugely significant market for development”. “The company is currently exploring opportunities to further grow the brands in China,” he added. The Topshop brands will stop being sold on Shangpin at the end of November.Green’s reputation has been shredded by the high-profile collapse of department store chain BHS. The tycoon had owned the chain for 15 years before selling it to serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell for £1 in 2015 – a year before the retailer collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs.The collapse of BHS prompted an inquiry by MPs and the pensions regulator into how the business had been managed and financed in the period before its collapse. The retailer had a pension deficit of up to £571m when it failed. Under substantial pressure, Green subsequently agreed to hand over £363m to the scheme in a deal with the regulator."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97dfe5bc02c4bf481d848988fa3477a6e3106c97/0_149_4228_2537/master/4228.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a6fdf208c69a9466d2871e752f9b9f8","title":"ryanair pilot strike grounds nearly 400 flights","story":"Airline says 396 flights will not take off on Friday because of walkouts across five countriesAlmost 400 Ryanair flights scheduled for Friday have been grounded because of pilot strikes.Employees in Ireland, Germany, Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands are staging a 24-hour walkout over pay and conditions.The Irish airline, Europe’s largest by passenger numbers, said 396 flights were cancelled, which could affect more than 74,000 passengers. Ryanair said it had informed customers as early as possible about the changes, but some said they had been given little notice. Karen Millar wrote: “Many thanks to Ryanair for cancelling my flight home and ensuring all the de-stressing I have done on this trip is cancelled out in an instant.”Others said they had to pay for extra nights in hotels and booking flights with other airlines.“Ryanair took every step to minimise the disruption and we notified our customers as early as possible, advising them of their free move, refund or reroute options.“The majority of customers affected have already been reaccommodated on another Ryanair flight. We want to again apologise to customers affected by this unnecessary disruption and we ask the striking unions to continue negotiations instead of calling any more unjustified strikes.”In December, Ryanair agreed to recognise trade unions for pilots and cabin crew in an attempt to head off strikes planned in the run-up to Christmas.The airline’s chief executive, Michael O’Leary, had previously said he would rather cut off his hands than agree to union recognition.However, after making deals with unions in countries including the UK and Italy, the airline has failed to engage with workers, unions claim.Pilots and cabin crew have responded with a string of strikes seeking better terms and conditions, with industrial action partly to blame for profit falling in the first quarter of Ryanair’s financial year.Cabin staff in Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Spain walked out for 48 hours last month.

It is me, a #brand, and I want you to know that I’m not interested in selling you stuff, I’m here to save the world. You see, I am not just a car company, I am fighting for gender equality. I am not just flogging shampoo, I am championing ersity. I am not just a betting company, I am crusading for LGBT rights.In the past, there were a few brands that wore their politics on their sleeves, be it Benetton or The Body Shop – however cosmetic some of those causes may have been. But now you can’t move for right-on capitalism – in an attempt to connect with millennials proven to be drawn to, and willing to spend more money on, socially conscious products. Which means modern brands have started using progressive values as a marketing ploy and are appropriating social activism as a form of advertising. It’s like the “greenwashing” of yore, but on a whole other level. We have, I’m afraid, entered a nauseating new age of woke-washing.For a recent case of woke-washing in action, please see Paddy Power. The often-exploitative gambling industry isn’t known for championing social justice however, last weekend Paddy Power sent an empty open-top bus, claiming it to be the “official bus of gay professional footballers”, to Brighton Pride, to make a statement about the “statistical anomaly” that none of the top 500 Premier League players are out and proud. The betting company said the campaign was designed to “encourage gay players to step up and come out, not just for themselves, but for the millions of LGBTQ fans and athletes worldwide that need a role model”.Paddy Power’s social justice slip-up is nothing compared to other brands, however. Take South Korean fashion brand, Stylenanda, which recently Photoshopped a model’s hand black an attempt to show that the brand is for everyone! Unfortunately for Stylenanda they also Photoshopped the model’s palm black and, as the internet quickly pointed out, black people don’t have black palms. And who could forget last year’s infamous Kendall JennerPepsi ad, which co-opted the Black Lives Matters movement in the most tone-deaf way imaginable? Kalle Lasn, editor of the anti-consumerist publication Adbusters, summed up the overwhelmingly negative response to the Pepsi ad when he described it as “the highest order mindfuck I’ve ever seen – the Donald Trump of commercial advertising”.Then there is Fearless Girl. The much-lauded sculpture was commissioned by State Street Global Advisors to advertise an index fund featuring companies with a high percentage of female leadership. In a completely predictable twist of fate, it transpired that State Street was accused of underpaying its female employees. Similarly, Audi spent millions on a feminist Super Bowl spot last year, which proclaimed: “Audi of America is committed to equal pay for equal work.” As many people quickly pointed out, Audi has no women on its executive team. You’ve got to hire women before you pay them equally, you know.As well as big companies jumping on the social justice brandwagon, you have startups expressly designed to profit off progressiveness. Feminist Apparel, for example, is an online retailer which sells T-shirts and totes featuring phrases such as “cats against catcalls” and “pizza rolls not gender roles”. In June, the company’s staff discovered that the founder and chief executive, Alan Martofel, had admitted to a history of abusing women. The staff asked Martofel to resign he responded by firing all of his employees. Martofel justified this by saying his company “exists in the weird space of feminism and business”.Woke-washing is not just lazy and hypocritical, it can be harmful it sanitises toxic business practices. However, that doesn’t mean the trend is entirely negative. There is something to be said for the fact that big companies feel compelled to don a progressive veneer. Advertising shapes our ideas about society and when big brands such as Paddy Power make a stand, even a ham-fisted one, for gay rights it can send a powerful message. At the very least, we should take solace from the fact that we seem to have moved from an advertising ethos of “sex sells” to “social justice sells”. Even when it is disingenuous, the more progressive messaging out there, the better. “Every little helps”, as I believe the courageous civil rights activist Tesco once said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0511ac795d0d59eafb1ff13a931fe27d0c576d03/0_0_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1799ff53d83b64a5f6ec3e06b7b97bf8","title":"puke pasties and poo the secret stinky world of cinema ushers","story":"They sign up for pick’n’mix and free films, but have to deal with rutting teenagers, rotting food and cups of excrement. Who knew the movies were so gross?Cinema’s real superheroes are not the vigilantes in Lycra who caper around on the big screens, but the underpaid employees stalking the aisles armed only with popcorn sweepers. Each season presents ushers with distinct challenges. At Christmas, parents use cinemas as a creche as they go present-shopping come spring, they let their Easter-egg-stuffed offspring vomit in the cup holders but the six-week summer holiday stretch is the most intense, when a combination of boredom and blockbusters turns everyone feral.A decade ago, I was part of a teenage cohort working for minimum wage at a small cinema in Cornwall. I learned many valuable lessons, such as how to answer the question: “What do you mean: ‘It’s sold out?’” with no trace of sarcasm. I learned about the toxic powder that could turn liquid sick into a scoopable solid. I discovered that humanity was even richer than the green (The Incredible Hulk), moneyed (Sex and the City) and melodramatic (Mamma Mia!) tapestry on screen. There were ways of making life easier, such as reminding tourists used to chain multiplexes that our films actually started at the time advertised. Telling sweet old ladies where a period drama was set meant they didn’t wait until the end of the credits to find out, thus hastening their exit and allowing us to clean up sooner. Not that fans of The Duchess made much mess compared with the Iron Man aficionados.Other behavioural oddities were less preventable: as well as “sold out”, “reserved seating” was apparently a difficult concept to grasp. Like most cinemas, we turned a blind eye to food brought in from outside. But we had to enforce a specific ban on pasties, which aren’t only messy, but also smell uncannily like BO. This made asking customers whether they were smuggling in a large Rowe’s steak pasty an awkward conversation – maybe they just had poor hygiene. I once found an empty seafood platter under a seat and felt for the neighbour of whoever sat there slurping down whelks like wet, fishy popcorn. On witnessing a blowjob in progress in the back row, I sprinted down the hallway to ask the manager what to do. “Stop them, obviously!” I legged it back: it was all over. Never had I been so grateful for the speedy satisfaction of teenage boys.But after speaking to a crop of current and former ushers, I think we got off lightly. One employee of a Hertfordshire cinema shudders to recall a recent “week of bodily fluids” that left staff capable of identifying a comprehensive range of effluents at a glance. Gary from Manchester explains that the ushers would often consume the sweets that customers left behind, but never the drinks. “Not after the time we found that someone had left behind a hot wee in one Pepsi cup and a steaming shit in another. Was Transformers: Dark of the Moon so interesting that they couldn’t have left to go to the toilet?”You sign up for a cinema summer job envisaging free films and pockets stuffed with stolen pick’n’mix, not, as a distressing amount of ushers lament, confronting cinemagoers’ desire to poo anywhere but the toilets. As if bringing a baby to the cinema weren’t antisocial enough, some parents change their nappies in a screen. “As I was hurriedly collecting filth for minimum wage, my foot knocked against something weighty under a seat,” says Rory, also from Manchester. “I reached under, picked it up and held it up to the light. I realised I was holding a used, full nappy. I can confirm that we provided baby-changing facilities.” The environmental catastrophe that Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson tackles in San Andreas pales in comparison with the used sanitary towel that Holly from Letchworth Garden City found after a screening of the 2015 disaster movie.People have been misbehaving at the cinema for as long as cinemas have existed. Patrons of the silent film era had to be reminded to remove large hats and were asked not to whistle. “We’re not observable in the dark, so we feel less inhibited in a variety of different ways,” says Cary Cooper, a specialist in organisational psychology. “You think you can get away with totally inappropriate behaviour that you wouldn’t do if it was light.” It is worse in “island cultures” such as Britain, he says, where we are “more inhibited to confront people about their breaking of the norms”.Every week, listeners write in to Mark Kermode and Simon Mayo’s BBC Radio 5 Live Film Review to complain about cinemagoers contravening the code of conduct that the pair created in 2010. (“No rustling”, “no slurping”, “no shoe removal”, etc.) “I think it was probably linked to the explosion in mobile phone use,” says Mayo. “I’ve been in films where people have been taking photographs of the crowd – with flash – during the film. All these kinds of things wouldn’t have been possible or thought of a few years ago. It’s the digital revolution that has changed everything and I think that’s the fuel behind the rage we tap into every week.”Mayo wonders whether cuts in cinema staffing have led to a rise in unchecked bad behaviour. “The very thought of an usher coming in and telling people to be quiet or put their phone away – it would be incomprehensible.” The code is intended as a stand against slipping standards, even though he knows that most of the show’s listeners conform to Cooper’s bystander effect, seething silently rather than confronting offenders.One type of cinema delinquency has a more complex social history than simply chucking popcorn around. “Just as the cinema generated new opportunities for working-class courtship, so did it have a similar impact on queer culture,” writes Matt Houlbrook in Queer London: Perils and Pleasures of the Sexual polis, 1918-1957. When homosexuality was illegal in Britain, many gay men held clandestine assignations in cinemas. “Indoors yet public, commercial yet open, music halls and cinemas sustained a sexual culture unlike anywhere else,” writes Houlbrook. “None of the outdoor locations where men found sex were as safe. In none were the sexual opportunities as concentrated.”Wishing to escape parental scrutiny but lacking the cash for hotels, teenagers also made a sexual sanctuary of the cinema. “Mothers of America  let your kids go to the movies!” Frank O’Hara wrote in his poem Ave Maria. “They may even be grateful to you  for their first sexual experience  which only cost you a quarter  and didn’t upset the peaceful home.”A chilling number of ushers mention finding sex toys – some still packaged, some not. Knickers and used condoms are regularly left among the popcorn crumbs. One usher recalls a colleague finding a bloodied teenage girl in the toilets. “She was physically OK, although maybe emotionally and mentally scarred.” Rough sex in the seats had caused her partner’s foreskin to tear. “He was, reasonably so, panicking. When we said we had to call the ambulance and even their parents, they freaked out even more. Turns out they weren’t dating – he was her boyfriend’s best mate.”One way of tackling cinematic misdemeanours, says Cooper, would be to turn up the lights a bit. But where would be the fun in that? It is possible that highlighting the poor ushers left to pick up your popcorn (or pants) might deter patrons from acting up, he says, citing the success of similar safety campaigns on motorways. “It does inhibit that behaviour when you make it human.”So, this summer, try your best not to subject the underpaid ushers to horrors beyond having to watch Hotel Transylvania 3 eight times a day. Arrive on time, put your mess in the bin and, for God’s sake, use the toilets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aff56fd1575386ceb38a2ef3c8d56173c0d3ed7a/0_2_3334_2001/master/3334.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f43d6e70db0e496be10b99c21575ec96","title":"hollywood film long reads journalism","story":"Long reads are proving irresistible to film executives, with Jennifer Lopez, Matthew McConaughey, Ben Affleck and Robert Redford all signing on to star in fact-based projectsMedia cognoscenti have been forecasting the death of long-form journalism for at least a decade now, and you can’t blame them. As readers moved from print to the internet, fewer publications have invested the time and money necessary to produce the kind of dense, narrative non-fiction that once took up the pages of most major American magazines. Our attention s, too, have dwindled, increasingly dictated by the number of characters allotted in a tweet.But in spite of these grim developments, the death knell may have been sounded prematurely. Not only has 2018 been something of a banner year for journalism of both the long and short variety, but there’s been an uptick in non-fiction articles being adapted for film and television. While it’s true this may speak more to the robust state of on-screen media (and its trigger-happy approach to adapting books, podcasts, and even songs), than it does some kind of long-form renaissance, it’s also a reaffirmation that, even in the age of clickbait, there’s still a voracious appetite for non-fiction that’s shorter than a book but longer than a tweet.Exhibit A is Jessica Pressler’s New York magazine piece on the socialite grifter Anna Delvey, who pulled off a brilliant and deranged scam on New York City’s top brass before her luck, and money, ran out. The story went viral in a day, and in about as much time Shonda Rhimes had acquired the rights to it for a Netflix series. Soon after, Vulture was “dreamcasting” the show, and then Ms Delvey herself was reportedly suggesting Hollywood heavy-hitters like Jennifer Lawrence and Margot Robbie play her.Another piece by Pressler, her 2015 NYMag story on a group of strip club employees who turn the tables on their wealthy Wall Street clientele, recently got the go-ahead from Annapurna Pictures, with Jennifer Lopez starring as their ringleader. That same week, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon announced they’d be teaming up to adapt a Daily Beast article by Jeff Maysh about a former cop who rigged McDonald’s Monopoly to the tune of $24m in cash and prizes. They reportedly beat out Kevin Hart, Steve Carell and Robert Downey Jr for the rights. And that’s just what’s in the pipeline.September will mark the release of two feature films based on works of true-crime non-fiction. The first is White Boy Rick, the story of Richard Wershe, an unlikely teenage coke kingpin in Detroit who turned out to be an FBI informant snitching on the very customers to whom he dealt. It was Evan Hughes’s masterful 2015 piece for The Atavist, a National Magazine award finalist, that put White Boy Rick on the map. Wershe is himself still incarcerated, but on the big-screen he’ll be played by Richie Merritt, with Matthew McConaughey playing White Boy Rick’s father.A few weeks later comes The Old Man \u0026amp The Gun, adapted by David Lowery from David Grann’s 2003 New Yorker article of the same name. It stars Robert Redford as Forrest Tucker, a legendary bank robber and stickup man who escaped jail no less than 20 times. The original piece has all the best elements of a Grann story: the human interest mixed with the investigative, structured and paced like a Hollywood thriller. So it’s no wonder much of his work has been optioned for film and television, including his book Killers of the Flower Moon, a Martin Scorsese-Leonardo DiCaprio adaptation of which is said to begin filming early next year, and The Lost City of Z, released last year to mostly positive reviews.In view of all this, it should come as no surprise that there’s already a film in development about what was perhaps the biggest story in journalism this past year: the New York Times’ investigation into allegations of decades-long sexual abuse against Harvey Weinstein. The rights to a film about Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey’s reporting on the disgraced Hollywood executive were purchased by Plan B, Brad Pitt’s production company, and Annapurna, which produced Phantom Thread and Barry Jenkins’ upcoming If Beale Street Could Talk.Magazine articles-turned-films are not unprecedented Argo, a Best Picture winner, derived from Joshuah Bearman’s 2007 Wired piece The Great Escape, and classics like Boogie Nights, Almost Famous, Shattered Glass, Adaptation, and Saturday Night Fever were all adapted from stories that ran in Rolling Stone, Vanity Fair, New York magazine, and the New Yorker. The rights for these stories can fetch up to six figures, although most sell for somewhere between $5,000-$75,000. Because of what it costs to actually make a movie, startlingly few optioned articles actually get made.Today, however, there’s more of an infrastructure in place to facilitate the adaptation of magazine pieces for film and television. Bearman, with fellow Wired journalist Joshua Davis, created the website Epic, an online literary platform that commissions long-form non-fiction pieces that would make for good films and allows writers to retain the rights to those films. Condé Nast Entertainment, a ision of the publishing behemoth that includes Vanity Fair and the New Yorker, was christened to develop film and television projects spawned from the company’s journalism.And with fewer and fewer publications green-lighting narrative non-fiction, digital platforms like Longform and the Atavist are providing writers with alternative ways to sink their teeth into time-consuming projects. In some cases, entire production companies have been started to more easily fuse the work of reporters and screenwriters, as in the case of Page 1, the production company founded by producer-writer Mark Boal with former New York Times magazine editor Hugo Lindgren. “It’s not like we just hand over the research to the screenwriter, and they’re off and running,” Boal told the Wall Street Journal in 2016. “What it has involved is teaming reporters with our screenwriters and having them work together.”All of which is to say long-form journalism, though far from being the sacred cow it was in the 60s and 70s, is evolving rather than dying. Increasingly, literary non-fiction is thought of not as the product itself, but as a springboard for other products. Ideally, journalists would be given the resources to write and report the stories that so often become the basis for more profitable films, TV shows, and even podcasts. But if the prospect of adaptation is what’s helping long-form journalism stave off its presumptive death, one could even say we’ve entered a boom time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f057ead9eb0ade144287075422696174a3ecbb44/0_253_4935_2962/master/4935.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0be283d30038d7dde5f678dffbb044f1","title":"the last temptation of christ scorcese 30th anniversary","story":"The controversial 1988 film was protested upon release but decades later remains one of the most fascinating films about religion ever madeA few decades before Hollywood started reaping every last bit of arable intellectual property, Martin Scorsese imagined a gritty reboot of Jesus Christ. In the devout Christian’s retelling of the greatest story ever told – adapted, per a title card, from Nikos Kazantzakis’ novel and not the New Testament – star Willem Dafoe dared to play the son of God as a mortal, and a flawed one at that. His feathery-haired Jesus had a temper and an ego, defects of virtue that the holier texts would never allow. He speaks in a combination of scriptures and modern vernacular, an odd combination more pronounced in Harvey Keitel’s curly-headed Bronx Judas. Most scandalizing of all, Jesus has a bit of a libido to him, making graphic onscreen love to his wife Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey). At the time, religious groups were up in arms over what they saw as a blithely sacrilegious depiction of the Christ, and Blockbuster Video refused to stock the film.Thirty years later, and the tongue-cluckers have largely won the battle. In the compact realm of explicitly religious cinema, the behemoth known as Pure Flix has flooded the market with morally clear-cut pabulum guaranteed to offend nobody except movie lovers. The likes of The Case for Christ, I’m Not Ashamed and the God’s Not Dead franchise move with a sense of black and white assuredness, dealing in Manichean absolutes from which the good is simply chosen over the evil. They also hold dominion over the box office, while the exceptions to the trend – the recent First Reformed and Scorsese’s 2016 drama Silence – languish in obscurity when not actively losing money. Those disciple films sacrificed a broader audience by eschewing the comforting clarity of organized religion for doubt, challenging their characters’ faith rather than blindly affirming it. They followed the primary teaching of Scorsese’s Jesus: he who claims to know the mind of God is farthest from it.Uncertainty runs rampant through the nearly three-hour sprawl of Christ’s life and times, in turns tormenting and compelling him. Paul Schrader’s script introduces a sinewy Dafoe lugging crucifixes around in his work as a carpenter, effectively collaborating with the Romans in their persecution of the Jews. The radicalized Judas sways his intellectual peer to the cause of the Israelites’ liberation, and even then Jesus falters in his mission. As he sets out on the path of his destiny, he remains committed to his principles of love, compassion and forgiveness above the politicized stance forced upon him. Jesus gets the sense that both sides of this conflict want to make a pawn of him, and he’s torn between wanting to remain unaffiliated in the affairs of men and the clear moral imperative to put an end to persecution. Of course Jesus eventually sides with the rebels, but that doesn’t provide him with any respite from his insecurities and misgivings. He’s eternally at war with himself, his every impulse challenged in his own mind. He’s filled with lust for Mary, and distrustful of the very pleasures of the flesh that he craves. As he screams atop the crucifix, he wants to be a good son and fulfill his purpose on the mortal plane still, he’s confused and frustrated at the set of seemingly arbitrary, incredible steep demands that have been made of him by a God he cannot see. In the most famed departure from the traditional scripture, Jesus allows himself to be fooled by Satan in the guise of his little girl  angel, climbing down off the cross and building a happy domesticity for himself with a wife and child. When he realizes he’s been fooled, the entire story resets itself and snaps back to the moment he made that choice. Crucially, he gets the opportunity to make good – transgression, penance, redemption.That’s the three-part cycle that’s guided much of Scorsese’s work, from Taxi Driver to Silence. He has always treated religion as a philosophical expedition rather than a set of rigid guidelines, and he instills that searching impulse in his daringly imperfect protagonist. He depicts Jesus as something closer to a Christian than Christ, a man constantly parsing and re-interpreting his relationship to God depending on the given situation. The Last Temptation of Christ is a film of questions and not of answers, Scorsese’s confession that the closest any of us can get to godliness is not full understanding, only partially-comprehending goodness. There’s arrogance in claiming enlightenment on Earth, and true humility only in prostration Scorsese communes with God by accepting that some aspects of worship are mysteries and then wondering about them anyway, catching a glimpse of His light in the process of inquisition. Scorsese and his Christ figure collapse in unison at the film’s conclusion (and after 163 minutes of suffering, the audience might be there as well), acquiescing to the will of God without grasping the big picture of the cosmos. Their reward for submitting to the unknowable? Blinding white light, pealing celestial bells and the heaven of the end credits.

Bernd Leno will challenge Petr Cech in goal, while centre-back Sokratis Papastathopoulos and full-back Stephan Lichtsteiner will add experience at the back. Uruguay’s Lucas Torreira and 19-year-old Matteo Guendouzi are intriguing additions in midfield. Jacob SteinbergIt was not straightforward but Eddie Howe eventually secured his No 1 target with Jefferson Lerma, the Colombia midfielder, joining for a club-record £25m fee. The Cherries did not go wild this summer but in Levante’s Diego Rico they have provided long-serving left-back Charlie Daniels with serious competition, while Howe can unlock the raw potential of David Brooks, the 20-year-old Wales international midfielder who joins from Sheffield United. Ben FisherChris Hughton focused on adding competition in defence, signing Leon Balogun and Bernardo after watching the pair impress in the Bundesliga, and Brighton also broke their transfer record to sign Alireza Jahanbakhsh from AZ Alkmaar. The Iranian winger scored 21 goals in the Ereisie last season. It was a productive summer for the Seagulls, with full-back Martin Montoya arriving on deadline day. JSIn: Alireza Jahanbakhsh AZ Alkmaar, £17m Yves Bissouma Lille, £15m Bernardo RB Leipzig £9m Florin Andone Deportivo, £5.3m Percy Tau Mamelodi Sundowns £3m Martin Montoya Valencia und David Button Fulham und Dan Burn Wigan, und (loaned back) Billy Arce CSD Independiente, und (loaned to Extremadura).A fruitful final week eased Sean Dyche’s frustrations after a difficult summer. The Burnley manager strengthened in central defence with Ben Gibson, added to his collection of England goalkeepers by ending Joe Hart’s 12-year association with Manchester City and, while unable to re-sign Jay Rodriguez, secured the Championship’s leading goalscorer from last season in Matej Vydra. Andy Hunter Neil Warnock’s early signings, a quartet who have excelled in the Championship, fit his mould of working with hungry players. They failed to lure Marko Grujic back from Liverpool and the deadline day arrivals of midfielders Victor Camarasa and Bournemouth’s Harry Arter do not mask how light the newcomers are in terms of Premier League experience and firepower. BFChelsea’s summer was fraught and political, with recruitment delayed until Antonio Conte had left and Maurizio Sarri arrived. Jorginho will implement the new head coach’s philosophy on the pitch. Thibaut Courtois’ fractious departure was costly, with a world record fee required to secure Kepa, available for £17.9m in January. Keeping Eden Hazard was key, but a penny for the thoughts of Ruben Loftus-Cheek over the loan signing of Mateo Kovacic. Dominic FifieldMoney was tight at Selhurst Park, with a restrictive wage bill that restricted expenditure and hefty payments due to Liverpool for Christian Benteke and Mamadou Sakho. Losing Yohan Cabaye was a blow, and replacing Ruben Loftus-Cheek was awkward. So to bring in four players for an outlay of £9.5m, plus wages, was impressive. Max Meyer has a point to prove, and Vicente Guaita was one of the best goalkeepers in Spain last season. DFHaving spent most of the summer trying to reduce the wage bill and squad size, Everton went into overdrive on deadline day with three eye-catching signings. Brazil international Bernard arrived on a free transfer while a club delegation flew to Barcelona to complete deals for defender Yerry Mina and André Gomes, the latter on loan. AHFulham’s business, on paper at least, looks hugely impressive. A squad bolstered by loanees last season appears to have been upgraded. Securing Jean Michaël Seri from Nice was a coup, Alfie Mawson has aspirations to break into the England squad, while André Schürrle is a World Cup winner. Aleksandar Mitrovic returns and five players, including full-back Joe Bryan, forward Luciano Vietto and Marseille midfielder André Frank Zambo Anguissa were signed on a frantic deadline day. DFThree players who did well last season – Terence Kongolo, Florent Hadergjonaj and goalkeeper Jonas Lössl – made loan transfers permanent. German World Cup winner Erik Durm has arrived to strengthen left-back. The question is whether Huddersfield have added enough creativity much depends on how the young forwards Adama Diakhaby, Ramadan Sobhi and Isaac Mbenza perform. Paul DoyleInterest from Manchester United in Harry Maguire was headed off and means that, with the Turkish centre-back Caglar Soyuncu arriving on deadline day, the Foxes’ defence looks healthy. Jonny Evans, signed earlier in the summer, adds experienced competition. Riyad Mahrez departed but Claude Puel has added creativity in James Maddison and Monaco winger Rachid Ghezzal. Nick AmesA proposed £53m deal for Lyon playmaker Nabil Fekir collapsed before the World Cup and was never revived, but otherwise Liverpool enjoyed a hugely productive window. Jürgen Klopp’s midfield was strengthened with Naby Keïta and Fabinho, Xherdan Shaqiri will improve his attacking options and crucially, Klopp finally addressed his goalkeeping problems with the £65m signing of Alisson. AHIf it ain’t broke, why fix it? Even without the arrival of Riyad Mahrez, Pep Guardiola’s formidable squad was almost certainly strong enough to defend their title. City will trust Mahrez’s ability to thread those visionary passes in tight situations, and the winger could make the difference in Europe. Moreover, finally fit-again £50m full-back Benjamin Mendy will seem like a new signing. Louise TaylorExpect toys to be flung out of the pram and tears before bedtime. José Mourinho did not get Harry Maguire – or any of the centre halves he wanted in order to challenge City and Liverpool for the title. At least he made Fred a red and it will be intriguing to monitor the midfield relationship between the Brazilian and Paul Pogba. It needs to be better than that between Mourinho and Ed Woodward. LTExpect cries of “where’s the money gone” from Rafa Benítez as Newcastle ended the window showing a healthy profit on player dealings. Swansea centre half Federico Fernandez’s £6m deadline day move was necessary, selling Aleksandar Mitrovic for £22m is amazing business and Newcastle do look stronger than this time last year. Maybe, just maybe, a takeover beckons. LTMark Hughes has pruned his squad yet they finish the window stronger than they started it – especially after a late loan move for Danny Ings. Mohamed Elyounoussi and Stuart Armstrong should inject some pizzazz into what was becoming a tired squad, and the club have also signed goalkeeper Angus Gunn and centre-back Jannik Vestergaard. Hughes has also kept hold of James Ward-Prowse, Matt Targett, Alex McCarthy and Ryan Bertrand. BFDaniel Levy left it late again, but there was no last-gasp splurge from Tottenham this time. They became the first Premier League side not to sign a player in the summer window since its introduction in 2003, with Aston Villa unmoved by interest in Jack Grealish, and also failed to sell Toby Alderweireld, Mousa Dembéle and Danny Rose. JSWatford’s window started well, with a flurry of useful squad-strengthening activity and the permanent arrival of Gerard Deulofeu, but then turned very quiet, save for a late £1m move for Domingos Quina. The failure to sign a high-profile striker despite their evident need for one is puzzling, and overall the impression is of a club that has stood still. Simon BurntonWest Ham completed most of their business early, with Manuel Pellegrini in a hurry to make extensive improvements to his new side. They broke their transfer record to sign Felipe Anderson from Lazio, signed Ryan Fredericks and Jack Wilshere on frees, and finished a busy window by signing Lucas Pérez from Arsenal and Carlos Sánchez from Fiorentina. JSJoão Moutinho, Leander Dendoncker and Adama Traoré are the stand-out names from a frantic summer that also saw key players from their promotion season nailed down to permanent deals. Wolves have moved decisively although they arguably still lack a prolific forward – Raúl Jiménez will look to change that – and it was a big call to let set-piece specialist Barry Douglas join Leeds for what looks a cut-price fee.

Both have large numbers of sceptics among their club’s supporters, and doubts also persist about the popularity of their methods with players. So both managers need their teams to perform brightly as soon as the season kicks off in order to lift the mood. Preparations have been complicated by the transfer window and the delayed return of key players from the World Cup – and the fusses around Paul Pogba and Harry Maguire, in particular – so there is a lot of uncertainty about the lineups. But there could be some interesting inclusions, such as Fred in Manchester United’s midfield and James Maddison in the away team’s. The centre of each team’s defence, however, is what could determine the outcome of this match. PD• Premier League preview: Manchester United• Manchester United veto Mourinho’s transfer wishlist• Pre-season preview: Leicester CityAll three promoted clubs survived last season but you get the impression that will not be enough for Wolves, who surely did not launch into a historic spending splurge just to finish 17th. With players such as João Moutinho, Diogo Jota, Rui Patrício and Adama Traoré enriching a squad that ran away with last season’s Championship, Wolves fancy trying to emulate the Blackburn and Newcastle teams of the early 1990s by going straight up and jostling with the elite. That is harder now but a European place seems a reasonable target. Everton have also spent heavily and are aiming at least as high in Marco Silva’s first season in charge. This opening-day encounter will give some indication of which of these clubs is more likely to achieve their ambitions. PD• Everton make three major signings on deadline day• Carl Ikeme: People are diagnosed with terminal cancer. I was lucky• Richarlison: Marco Silva will win things with EvertonStarting a new job is tough. It’s even tougher in a new country. But in a new country, against the league champions, and versus a manager you’ve never beaten before …welcome to England, Unai Emery. There’s another thing the new Arsenal manager will have to contend with against Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City on Sunday too: his defence, about which no one can be certain. In all probability Shkodran Mustafi and Sokratis Papastathopoulos will be the starting central pair, but the former is thoroughly unconvincing and the latter is a 30-year-old not known for his pace, playing his first game in English football. Emery’s life will be made much easier with a win on Sunday but with a new goalkeeper in Bernd Leno possibly starting too, he can’t exactly bank on a clean sheet, particularly with Sergio Agüero looking immediately sharp. NM• What does Kroenke’s takeover mean for Arsenal?• Premier League preview: Manchester CityLast season Huddersfield beat Frank De Boer’s Crystal Palace 3-0 on the opening day, their cohesion and vibrancy exposing the confusion of their opponents. David Wagner has not made many additions to his squad this summer but can count on his team being as spirited and well-drilled as they were last season and that will make them difficult opponents for Chelsea, who looked a mess during last week’s defeat in the Community Shield, albeit to a Manchester City side that have a smidgin more talent than Huddersfield. Maurizio Sarri will be able to field a stronger lineup this weekend but there is still a sense that this is as good an opportunity as Huddersfield are likely to get to beat Chelsea. PD• Premier League preview: Huddersfield Town• Ed Aarons: Kepa set to take flight as one of world’s best goalkeepers• Jacob Steinberg: five things on Sarri’s mind before new seasonTasked with making West Ham both more solid and more attractive, Manuel Pellegrini must have dispatched a spectacular volley of swear words when this season’s fixture list arrived. Liverpool away is a heck of a first assignment for a manager attempting to rebuild a side that had the joint-worst defence in the league last season, when they were twice thrashed 4-1 by Jürgen Klopp’s attack ninjas. West Ham have recruited quite wisely during the summer and are likely to deploy a new goalkeeper, Lukasz Fabianksi, and at least two new defenders (such as the right-back Ryan Fredericks and one or both of the new centre-backs, Issa Diop and Fabián Balbuena). They are all going to have to settle in quickly if West Ham’s revamped attack is to have any chance of ruining the debut of Liverpool’s new goalkeeper, Alisson Becker, by outscoring the hosts. PD• Paul Doyle: Sturridge can lead the way for forgotten men• Premier League preview: Liverpool• Felipe Anderson: I’m fast and I’m going to use my intelligenceLast season onlookers repeatedly said Cardiff would start dropping down the Championship table, right up until they got promoted. So Neil Warnock’s men will not be bothered that almost no one sober sees them finishing above the bottom three this season. Cardiff are limited, no doubt, but they will not be easy to beat and, having added Bobby Reid to their attack, they could be dangerous from more than just set pieces. But they are still a long shot to win at Bournemouth, who also have a well-honed method along with better players. PD• Premier League preview: Bournemouth• Premier League preview: Cardiff CityThis fixture provides Southampton with the perfect chance to show they are a different animal from last season. In November a late header by Sam Vokes, the striker who was born in the city, allowed Burnley to take three points and left Saints supporters tearing their hair out at a turgid, one-dimensional performance. Mark Hughes has cajoled more vigour out of the squad and the arrivals of Mohamed Elyounoussi and Stuart Armstrong should add further zip. Burnley have already played three Europa League matches this season – they will not have returned from Istanbul until the early hours of Friday morning – and Saints, who won only four league games at home last season, must assert their authority at St Mary’s. But Sean Dyche’s watertight defence is notoriously hard to breach and Southampton need to ease the burden on the former Burnley striker Charlie Austin to find the net. BF• Southampton finally sign Ings after Palace prefer Jordan Ayew• Premier League preview: Southampton• Burnley manage goalless draw at Basaksehir in Europa LeagueBrighton are seemingly only heading in one direction. An aggressive recruitment drive this summer, funded by their fiercely ambitious owner, Tony Bloom, has paved the way for Chris Hughton’s side to build on their 15th-placed finish last season. They appear to have solved the reliance on Glenn Murray too, by adding Florin Andone, Yves Bissouma and Alireza Jahanbakhsh, the latter for a club-record £17m, eclipsing the £14m fee they paid for Jürgen Locadia – the striker who could miss the start of the season with a groin injury – in January. Promoted Wolves and Fulham have been tipped to creep into the top 10 but Brighton have plans to make huge strides this season too. How Watford, a mishmash squad led by the easily forgettable Javi Gracia – the Pozzo family’s 10th manager since 2012 – must pine for such firepower. Short on striking options, they could be about to come unstuck. BF• Premier League preview: Watford• Premier League preview: Brighton \u0026amp Hove AlbionFulham have enjoyed better summers than most – promotion, a flurry of exciting new faces to whet the appetite and key players Ryan Sessegnon and Tom Cairney staying put. But perhaps their shrewdest move was the one of their last, a £6m move for the Bristol City defender Joe Bryan. The left-back has matured at his boyhood club over the past few seasons and his arrival means Sessegnon can flourish further up the pitch, as he did when Matt Targett arrived on loan from Southampton last season. Bryan, who earned the nickname Springbok owing to his incredible leap, has a big engine, a peach of a left foot and, at 24, has plenty of head room to improve. Bryan backed out of a move to Aston Villa in favour of Fulham but the only real surprise is that no other club offered him a ticket to the Premier League. Forging a partnership with Sessegnon will prove no problem, starting against Crystal Palace on Saturday. BF• Fulham break record with £30m Anguissa deal on frantic last day• Richard Williams: Sessegnon leads exciting teenagers facing scrutiny• Premier League preview: Crystal PalaceA repeat of last season’s opening-day fixture, but that’s not the only thing that will be familiar at St James’ Park. A year ago Rafa Benítez had spent the summer grappling with his board over their transfer activity (or lack thereof), and on Saturday he’ll do the same. In a perverse way Benítez is his own worst enemy: keeping Newcastle in the Premier League is essentially Mike Ashley’s sole aim until he finds someone to buy the club, and Benítez did that with relative comfort last season. Ashley thus does not have the imperative to spend big money, and has to just do enough to keep the manager, a hero in the stands, from walking. But there must be a point where all of this impacts on a thin-looking team: even if Spurs look a little undercooked themselves, Ashley could witness the harsh realities of his policies first hand.

In the 90s, I lived between Lagos and London (heavy on Lagos). When I landed back in London permanently, I was itching to leave again. First California, teaching little girls art and horse-riding (never at the same time). Then Berlin. And, as of two and a half years ago, at the grand age of 33, I made my biggest, and most taxing move yet, swapping my east London postcode for a zip code in Brooklyn.Ah, 2016, that seemingly cursed year, which started with the death of David Bowie, continued with the Brexit referendum, before culminating in the demise of George Michael at Christmas. When I left England, we were still part of a (barely) united Europe, and the US president was an erudite black man with a spouse who retained an uncommon grace in the face of hostile conditions. Things aren’t so simple any more. My plan had been to walk in the shoes of the foreign correspondent – think our woman in Alabama, rather than our man in Havana – following a path paved by Alexis de Tocqueville, or Alistair Cooke. I’m more than well versed in the art of being the foreigner in many rooms, even if my foreignness resides only in the minds of the others present: the man who complimented my “very good English” at a London station, say, or the countless people over the years who have asked where I’m really from. But in New York, I was a different type of foreign despite our common language, a stranger in a strange land. So I have been learning, observing, interpreting and elucidating the US’s many customs through a filter markedly different from many of those who have come before me. And, when necessary, I have interjected. Like, what’s up with all the flag love? I have communed with Prince fans after his death in Minneapolis. It turns out that being black in the US is not so different from being black in Britain: in both, we “enjoy” a status that is simultaneously hypervisible and invisible. The joys of my identity are similar: I am part of a glorious sisterhood that affirms me in a language that transcends geography. And the same is true of the problems, even when the tools being used to uphold our common problem – white supremacy – have their own local historical… flavour. The sins of Empire mutated into the sins of Jim CrowEven so, I cannot lie: the accent helps. I am reaping the rewards of a lingering American enchantment with a certain British accent. I have had free drinks slid down bars, and people clutching their throats in delight when I start speaking. I’m suddenly a person who disarms not with my own natural charm, but by virtue of an accent that is just an accident of birth. A British accent can be an asset to a journalist when it comes wrapped in my skin, it turns into something even more useful. People tell me things and I can’t explain why. Is it because I’m not a “local” black person? Does my foreignness make them more open to talking to me?To be a black British woman (I’m trying to be a carefree black girl, as the once internet-popular catchphrase encourages, but the world today always let me) is always cause for rejoicing, sometimes in the midst of immense psychic sorrow. My time in the US has coincided with some of the most awful chapters in today’s push for social justice and civil rights. The police killing of Philando Castile in July 2016 was followed by the police shooting of Korryn Gaines a month later: #SayHerName, distinct but concurrent with #BlackLivesMatter, was another campaign seeking level humanhood. But I have friends here, and a cluster of houseplants. I travel and eat well. Being a foreigner with means has opened up the country, for work and leisure, finding new parts of myself in new places. There have been highs and lows. I have danced in a New Orleans jazz club and cried at multiple Broadway shows. I have attended protests and reported the trial of a murderous white supremacist.But when I do the stocktake of what will probably be called The American Years in my memoirs, and weigh what was against what is, I am left with a surplus. If you let it, travel broadens the mind. I have sought a word to sum up how I feel and only a nonsense one from The Simpsons will do. I feel… embiggened."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c3be5afb41bd9a458a62a5a7badcabffdf5a3d1/18_9_2525_1515/master/2525.jpg?w=2500\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d577d5f7f87428686b40cec1c2ed5e7 2500w","title":"cbi urges government to drop brexit blunt target on immigration numbers","story":"Business leaders call on Theresa May to bring in new freedom of movement rules for EU citizensThe Confederation of British Industry has urged Theresa May to drop her “blunt target” on immigration numbers and introduce new freedom of movement rules for EU citizens post-Brexit to ensure firms, large and small, can stay in business when the UK leaves the bloc.Outlining the results of a major consultation with business leaders, Josh Hardie, the CBI’s deputy director general, said companies believed an injection of honesty was urgently needed in the political debate about migration.“This is no longer a theoretical debate, it’s about the future of our nation. False choices and sloganeering must be avoided at all costs,” he said.In a report, published on Friday, the CBI argues that the nation’s needs are more complex than simply ensuring that the UK could attract the “brightest and best”.It calls for new rules for EU citizens to keep open the pipeline of migrant workers in all sectors including agriculture, hospitality, construction, the NHS and the creative industries and an easing of the policy for non-EU workers to give small businesses, unable to afford the visas or deal with Home Office red tape, a chance to plug any gaps arising from Brexit.“Openness and control must not be presented as opposites. Public attitudes towards migration and the impact it has on communities are far more nuanced,” said Hardie.The CBI’s report on immigration comes weeks after a cabinet split on post-Brexit immigration policy, with the former home secretary Amber Rudd’s plans to give EU citizens preferential treatment reportedly scrapped in June by her successor, Sajid Javid.The CBI report – Open and Controlled, A New Approach to Migration – concludes that a root and branch change is needed in Britain’s immigration approach following what it says was an “extensive” consultation with employers and trade associations representing 124,000 firms.It argues that May’s long-held immigration target of 100,000 migrants a year is not viable that rules on visas for non-EU workers are too expensive and too restrictive and a new EU citizens-only policy needs to be developed to keep the economy on the road.“Scrapping blunt targets, ensuring all who come to the UK contribute and using the immigration idend to support public services will add to public confidence,” said Hardie.“The building blocks of a successful new migration system for the UK begin with an honest and open debate that has been absent from politics. The stakes couldn’t be higher. Get it wrong, and the UK risks having too few people to run the NHS, pick fruit or deliver products to stores around the country. This would hurt us all – from the money in our pockets to our access to public services.”While recognising that immigration “has also given rise to legitimate public concern about the pressure it creates on public services and on society”, the report says leaving the EU will mean “momentous change” for business which should be addressed properly by the government.Shifting the tone of the debate to focus on the positive benefits of migration will help build public trust, it says.The CBI argues that immigration has “delivered significant economic benefit to the UK” over the past 50 years and maintaining access to people and skills was “a high priority for business in the UK as it prepares to leave the EU”.The report reflects findings from research and surveys of 18 different sectors, one of the largest consultations of its kind. It says a pragmatic approach to migration will secure Britain’s future as a country open for business and foreign-inward investment.The CBI argues that simply extending the current approach to non-EU citizens to all migrants will be unworkable for business as the current tier-2 visa system involves a cap on numbers coming to Britain each month and is tilted in favour of higher earners.In April, Danny Mortimer, the chief executive of NHS Employers, revealed he knew of at least 400 doctors who had been blocked from entering the UK to take up job offers because of the cap.It recommends registration for all EU citizens migrating to the UK following Brexit and to restrict their stay to three months unless they can prove they are working, studying or self-sufficient.This mirrors existing freedom of movement rules under EU law but would bring the UK into line with most other nations within the bloc by giving countries the means by which to monitor migration through registration.It also recommends that the government should reinstate controls on access to in-work benefits but continue to exempt EU workers from a health charge that applies to non-EU workers.It also wants the government to ringfence the rights of EU citizens to secure their place in the country in the event of no deal, echoing calls from campaigners."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/928af9349673772f79fb1ec195906363b5e5943f/0_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0df6c8cd1e39ee7408dfa15d6796ef66","title":"salt not as damaging to health as previously thought says study","story":"New research reignites a row with scientists who want to reduce salt intake to near zeroSalt may not be as damaging to health as is usually claimed, according to a controversial new study which suggests campaigns to persuade people to cut down may only be worthwhile in countries with very high sodium consumption, such as China.The World Health Organization recommends cutting sodium intake to no more than 2g a day – the equivalent of 5g of salt – because of the link to increased blood pressure, which is in turn implicated in stroke.But no country has ever managed to get population salt or sodium intake that low, the authors of the study published in the Lancet medical journal point out. Their research, the Canadian academics say, shows it may be pointless to try in countries like the UK and the US.The study by Prof Andrew Mente from the Population Health Research Institute of Hamilton Health Sciences and McMaster University and colleagues is large, involving more than 90,000 people in more than 300 communities in 18 countries. But it immediately reignited a simmering row with other scientists who are on a crusade to reduce our salt consumption to near zero.Mente and colleagues found that the harmful effects of sodium – raised blood pressure and stroke – only occurred in countries like China, where the liberal use of soy sauce leads to sodium levels over 5g a day, the equivalent of 12g of salt. And they found that very low levels of salt actually led to more heart attacks and deaths, suggesting moderate salt intake may be protective.“Our study adds to growing evidence to suggest that, at moderate intake, sodium may have a beneficial role in cardiovascular health, but a potentially more harmful role when intake is very high or very low. This is the relationship we would expect for any essential nutrient and health. Our bodies need essential nutrients like sodium, but the question is how much,” said Mente.Two years ago, the same team published a study with similar results, also in the Lancet, looking at iniduals. It was lambasted by critics, who called it “bad science” and its findings were rejected by the American Heart Association.The latest observational study – not a randomised controlled trial which compares different groups of people – looks at communities rather than iniduals. It immediately came in for heavy criticism. The chief complaint was that it did not accurately measure the amount of sodium in people’s urine, which needs to be done over a 24 hour period.“The authors have not addressed any of the serious criticisms from the wider scientific community of their 2016 study,” said Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London, and founder of the salt-reduction campaign Cash (Consensus Action on Salt and Health). “These criticisms include the use of ill participants in the study, leading to reverse causality (ie those suffering with heart disease don’t eat much food, and consequently eat less salt, but it is the illness that leads to death rather than lower salt intake), and the use of spot urine measurements.”Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King’s College London, said campaigns to lower salt intake have been beneficial in some countries. “Intakes of salt in the UK have fallen over the past 30 years from over 12g per day to 7 to 8g per day, and this has been accompanied by a fall in average blood pressure of the population. Japan used to have a very high prevalence of high blood pressure and high rates of stroke, and took action to cut salt intake in the 1970s and now has much lower rates,” he said.But it is not easy to persuade people to forgo salt, say Franz Messerli and Louis Hofstetter, experts from Switzerland and New York in a commentary on the Lancet findings. They cite Sir George Pickering, regius professor of medicine at the University of Oxford, who wrote more than half a century ago: “The rigid low-sodium diet is insipid, unappetising, monotonous, unacceptable, and intolerable. To stay on it requires the asceticism of a religious zealot.”The new study measured potassium as well as sodium levels in people’s urine and found that higher potassium, which is found in fruit and vegetables, cut rates of stroke, heart disease and death. “Perhaps salt-reduction evangelists and salt-addition libertarians could temporarily put aside their vitriol and support the hypothesis that diets rich in potassium confer substantially greater health benefits than aggressive sodium reduction,” they write."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/253304808496e8ffb1c03a10849651f86ef54edb/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb1e2e11e089c0e0497eaa183404d7db","title":"blue light from phone screens accelerates blindness study finds","story":"Light from digital devices triggers creation of toxic molecule in the retina that can cause macular degenerationScientists say they have found how blue light from smartphones, laptops and other digital devices damages vision and can speed up blindness.Research by the University of Toledo in the US has revealed that prolonged exposure to blue light triggers poisonous molecules to be generated in the eye’s light-sensitive cells that can cause macular degeneration – an incurable condition that affects the middle part of vision.Blue light, which has a shorter wavelength and more energy compared with other colours, can gradually cause damage to the eyes.Dr Ajith Karunarathne, an assistant professor in the university’s department of chemistry and biochemistry, said: “We are being exposed to blue light continuously and the eye’s cornea and lens cannot block or reflect it.“It’s no secret that blue light harms our vision by damaging the eye’s retina. Our experiments explain how this happens, and we hope this leads to therapies that slow macular degeneration, such as a new kind of eye drop.”It is caused by the death of photoreceptor, ie light-sensitive cells, in the retina.Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in the US and while it does not cause total blindness, it can make everyday activities such as reading and recognising faces difficult.Photoreceptor cells need molecules called retinal to sense light and trigger signalling to the brain, enabling us to see.The researchers found that being exposed to blue light causes retinal to set off a chain of reactions that leads to toxic molecules being created in the photoreceptor cells.Kasun Ratnayake, a PhD student at the University of Toledo who was involved in the study, said: “If you shine blue light on retinal, the retinal kills photoreceptor cells as the signalling molecule on the membrane dissolves.“Photoreceptor cells do not regenerate in the eye. When they’re dead, they’re dead for good.”The researchers found that introducing retinal molecules to other cell types in the body, such as cancer cells, heart cells and neurons, caused them to die off when exposed to blue light.They also noticed that blue light alone or retinal without blue light had no effect on cells.Karunarathne said: “The retinal-generated toxicity by blue light is universal. It can kill any cell type.”The scientists found that a molecule called alpha-tocopherol, a natural antioxidant found in the eye and body, stops the cells from dying but fails to offer any protection to the ageing population or those whose immune systems have been suppressed.Karunarathne said: “That is when the real damage occurs.”For those wanting to protect their eyes from blue light, Dr Karunarathne advises wearing sunglasses that can filter both UV and blue light outside and avoiding browsing on mobile phones or tablets in the dark.The research is published in the journal Scientific Reports.

Talent, after all, is nothing without fortitude.At the position of three over par after two holes Woods was in danger of being a US PGA footnote. His latest tournament obituary was being penned.Often lost in discussion of the 42-year-old’s remarkable career is his ability to scrap like a seasoned street fighter. Woods retrieved all of his shots before signing for a level‑par 70 that will have him glancing towards the leaders on Friday as opposed to fearing a missed cut.“It kept me in the tournament,” Woods said of his recovery. “I could have easily gone the other way, being three over through two. A lot of things could happen, not a lot were positive but I hung in there and turned it around. I was able to grind out a score.”His determination was typified on the 15th, his 6th. Having found dense shrubbery twice he played a chip to within 3ft of the cup to save par. Rory McIlroy’s drive, clean approach and two putts appeared bland in comparison.Fowler has been in this position many times. An opening round of 65 was notable for his accuracy as the 29-year-old hit 16 of 18 greens in regulation. By close of play, Fowler had been headed by Gary Woodland’s 64. There was an element of surprise to that Woodland has no top 10s in his last 27 major appearances.If, as has been widely mooted, the course layout in Missouri more resembles a standard PGA Tour event than a major then Fowler has great cause for hope.He is yet to win one of the big four but has far less trouble converting promise into tangible reward on standard tour weeks.Cruel history, including at this event in 2014 when he was denied by McIlroy, has taught him not to look far ahead.“I’m definitely happy but on Thursday you can’t win the tournament, you can definitely take yourself out of it and lose it, so we took care of what we needed to take care of today and we move on,” Fowler said.Ian Poulter has the same aspiration as Fowler in seeking to crown years of eminence with a major triumph. His 67 kept the dream firmly alive. After a spell in Europe and having seen the dismal weather forecast for St Louis in the early part of this week, Poulter arrived a day before competitive action started.Deep emotion would be attached to a Jason Day victory. The Australian was rocked by the pre-tournament news that his close friend and compatriot Jarrod Lyle had died from leukemia at the age of 36. Lyle and Day began competitive careers in the United States at the same time.“I received a text about Jarrod. It’s hard because you sit there, you know him, he’s a buddy of yours and he’s not there anymore,” Day said after his 67. “He’s never going to come back. That’s the hardest thing to sort of come by.“I lived across the street from him when we first started out in Orlando. He was a good buddy of mine. It’s heartbreaking. My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife and two kids.”McIlroy matched Woods’s score. The third member of this marquee group, the defending champion, Justin Thomas, is one under. McIlroy missed a series of opportunities to produce a better score but railed against the widely held notion that Bellerive is there to be butchered.“I didn’t hear any of that from the players,” he said. “That’s from people that aren’t playing in the tournament, that haven’t played the course and they really don’t know.”McIlroy wore a protective strapping on his right arm but played down any suggestion of a serious problem.There was a denial, too, from the PGA of America regarding the tournament being affected by the hacking of the association’s computer files. The hack was accompanied by a ransom demand via a bitcoin address in the same week Tommy Fleetwood’s Open winnings were paid into someone else’s bank account.The European Tour got the wrong Tommy Fleetwood. It used to be such a simple game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1601ad2bd208f1a15e0dbacc62c232b0af33056e/121_216_5351_3211/master/5351.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f479f551069b7b6fdef07a21077ec096","title":"england v india second test day two live","story":"“Hi Rob,” says Tony O’Hanlon. “Sitting here in my armchair with a few scoops by my side in Sydney. It’s bloody freezing here and I have my aircon on 26 degrees which I know is going to whack me when the bill comes in later in the month. Tell me Rob, should I go to my warm bed. go to sleep and awake in the morning to find that I have missed England’s day of greatness and save a few dollars, or should I stay up burning my pension only to find the bloody English weather spoiled the day.”Go to bed. Do one. I don’t think there will be any more play today.6.3 overs: India 11-2 (Pujara 1, Kohli 0) Kohli is beaten by his first delivery, which jags off the seam, and takes a quick single off his second. That, alas, is that for the time being: it has started to rain and the umpires are hurrying everyone off the field.Two wickets for the future Sir Jimmy Anderson. Rahul feels defensively for a textbook outswinger that shaves the edge on its way through to Jonny Bairstow. Lovely bowling. Anderson’s reward is a crack at Virat Kohli in perfect bowling conditions.6th over: India 10-1 (Rahul 8, Pujara 1) Pujara’s Test record outside Asia is surprisingly poor for a player of his class: 957 runs at 27. In Asia he averages 65. He missing at least once an over, but he knows if he can survive this morning things should get easier. He also survives a couple of strangled shouts for LBW from Broad, who realised there was an inside edge on each occasion.5th over: India 9-1 (Rahul 8, Pujara 1) Anderson beats Pujara with another stunning outswinger. Pujara then gets off the mark with a single before Rahul tucks an attempted magic ball off his pads for four. There is plenty of dirty work for India’s batsmen to do out there. England would sell their souls to get Kohli to the crease in these conditions.“Am idly wondering what might be the fewest number of deliveries bowled in an entire game that’s finished up abandoned as a rain-affected draw?” says Kim Thonger. “If you feel like organising a sweepstake put me down for a blind stab at 23, (and I bet Old Trafford was the venue).”Well, 02 ain’t bad. It’s 72 balls, and it was Kandy. (Unless you count games where not a single ball was bowled, like Guyana in 1990.)4th over: India 4-1 (Rahul 4, Pujara 0) Rahul gets the first runs of the innings, clattering a cover drive for four off Broad. Cracking shot. England shouldn’t mind that they want India to be driving when the ball is doing this much.3rd over: India 0-1 (Rahul 0, Pujara 0) England’s new second slip, since you asked, is Jos Buttler. Anderson tries another magic ball to Pujara, who adjusts smartly to defend towards mid-off. Pujara has been in awful form that, and the conditions, will surely mean survival is his only aim this morning. Anderson almost gets rid of him with a gorgeous delivery from wide on the crease that straightens sharply past the edge. Three maidens in a row.2nd over: India 0-1 (Rahul 0, Pujara 0) Stuart Broad shares the new ball. He’s in no hurry, but perhaps he should be: the clouds are already starting to gather and England should be looking to get as many overs in as possible in these conditions. There’s some seam movement for Broad, though his radar is a bit off and Rahul is able to leave most deliveries outside off stump. The last delivery is a beauty and beats the outside edge.Here’s our man Romeo with the TMS link for those of you who live overseas.1st over: India 0-1 (Rahul 0, Pujara 0) There was extravagant movement for Anderson in that over, both in the air and off the pitch. “A month ago I’d never heard of Ollie Pope,” says Luke Dealtry. “Now I’m expecting a century on debut and in a month I’ll be an expert on his weakness outside off stump.”I’m sure you’ll agree that his comeback century against Australia in 2023 was a gem.Jimmy Anderson strikes with the fifth ball of the Test. It was the swing bowler’s magic ball: it angled in towards Murali Vijay before curving away to batter into the off stump. That was reminiscent of those famous Anderson stump-busters against New Zealand in 2008. The England players are waiting by the boundary edge, enjoying the craic. They are joined by the Indian openers, Murali Vijay and KL Rahul. We’re actually going to get some cricket. The wicket is pretty green, and should offer plenty to England’s seamers in the first session. The forecast is still for the apocalypse around lunchtime, though at the moment it’s a pleasant morning in North West London. Who ya gonna believe?England prefer Chris Woakes to Moeen Ali as the replacement for Ben Stokes, while Ollie Pope is in for Dawid Malan. India also make two changes: Cheteshwar Pujara is in for Shikhar Dhawan, who is yet again dropped during an overseas series, and the mystery spinner Kuldeep Yadav replaces Umesh Yadav.“It’s a fresh wicket,” says Joe Root. “We feel that with the weather around it gives us a chance to take some wickets this morning.”Virat Kohli says he would have bowled too. “You’ve just got to bat well. The wicket looks good and the guys are feeling confident. We have to be up for doing the dirty work.”Alec Stewart has presented Ollie Pope with his Test cap. He’s the fourth 20-year-old to make his Test debut for England in 2018. England have never previously given a debut to two under-21s in the same year, never mind four.An email! “As I type this, it’s 17 degrees and clear in Sydney, in the middle of winter, and 17 degrees and cloudy in London,” says Max Bonnell. “You English really have no idea how to do a heatwave.”I’m usually loath to defend English people, but I don’t think anybody is claiming this is a heatwave.Morning folks. Let’s try that one again, shall we. The first day of the Lord’s Test was a washout, and it gives me precisely 0.00 per cent pleasure to tell you today’s forecast isn’t much better. The weather is fine at the moment, so we should start on time - but the Met Office predicts rain, lots of rain, around lunchtime. Darn, blast and ach. If the forecast is accurate - and why wouldn’t it be - the captains will have a really tricky decision at the toss. Bowling conditions should be favourable today, but there might only be an hour or two of play. I suppose a shorter game reduces the risk of bowling first though.We should find out what we need to know at approximately 10.30am local time, with play scheduled to start at 11.

That’s the setup for the Australian company Hoopla Clique’s raucous circus show in the Piccolo tent. Two brothers – one shock-haired, the other floppy-fringed – are ordered to put away their toys, but within five minutes they’re hurling balls at each other, breaking out backflips and wielding homemade weaponry that sends toilet paper streaming every which way. Derek Llewellin and Julian Roberts’ sense of fun is infectious and their high-energy pranks thrill – and occasionally appal – the young audience. The result is a mess that, mercifully, you can leave someone else to tidy up. CWThe sharp-suited Valentijn Dhaenens cuts a convincing figure as a slippery, ambitious politician. The show opens with a speech bloated with metaphors and empty of content. It’s familiar stuff, eliciting wry laughs from the audience. Later, we see him talking strategy, giving statements to the media, making video calls to the family he barely sees, and sending regular, occasionally explicit missives to his lover. It recalls his performance in Ontroerend Goed’s Fight Night, another show about how we vote for the who rather than the what.

Riffing on Hans Christian Andersen, this is the tale of a duckling who doesn’t quack and kick in quite the right style for a feathery circus troupe. There is some sparkle here, and a sprinkling of audience participation, but the show isn’t afraid of darkness – not least in its lugubriously lit and exquisitely designed set. You’re left savouring not just the singer’s voice – warm and deep enough to bathe in – but also the elegant drawl of Tommy Bradson’s narration.

Odd then that For Worse isn’t a storytelling show, but no-frills standup addressing sex, marriage and new motherhood. It’s good too, although given the raucous subject matter and bar-room environment, it might fly higher in an evening slot. Barron misses few opportunities to flout propriety, waxing ambivalent about parenting, heaping scorn on other couples’ sweet nothings, and going dewy-eyed at the memory of her “two dicks in a day!” sexual peak.

BLThe Britain’s Got Talent star Lee Ridley’s new show, Inspiration Porn, is more political and vulnerable than anything you’d expect to see on the same TV programme as Simon Cowell. It is a distinctive mix of barbed disability comedy and self-mocking humour, in which Ridley caustically mocks the inspirational rhetoric that surrounds high-achieving disabled people, contrasting “yes we can” Paralympic mottos with the realities of his own life: lazy, lonely, he tells us, and “shit at everything”. The entwining of private and political is adroitly done, and Ridley’s call-to-arms to fight, not for heroic inidual success a la Britain’s Got Talent, but for social justice is – irony of ironies – inspiring.

Aqua’s Barbie Girl becomes a slow jam (“Life in sequins, it’s got new meanings!”), Cyndi Lauper’s anthem is rejigged for the school run (Mothers Just Want to Have Fun) and Let It Go has seldom sounded so empowering.

It transposes the three Fates of Greek mythology (who spin, measure and cut the cloth of life) from antiquity to a bleak cosmic sweatshop.

Directed by Sara Joyce, DugOut Theatre’s dynamic solo show has plenty of kapow, thanks to some stylised movement and scene transitions that mirror the action-packed panels of a comic book. Kennedy raises a range of questions about how we make decisions and who we trust. The storyline doesn’t have enough emotional punch, but Kennedy proves she could become a super-powered performer nonetheless.

In three discrete scenes, John Doran, Breffni Holahan and Maeve O’Mahony interrogate ideas about faking history, questioning absolute certainty and curating cultural memory. In each, they pick at a nugget of a conversation – their own or one remembered – smoothing the bumps of memory and creating a thin new film of fiction over fact. A stage manager bustles around the set, manipulating the story, and Malaprop’s deeply layered meta-theatricality dances a step ahead of the audience, teasing and probing. KWRead the full four-star reviewThis gloriously silly show about growing up and growing apart, finely stitched into a series of unpredictable, beautifully performed sketches, leaves you light-headed with enjoyment. If you have seen Sheeps’ earlier work, or are familiar with Liam Williams’ dour persona elsewhere, the razzle-dazzle song-and-dance opener is intensely funny. Their sketches pull in all sorts of directions, from surrealist to clever-clever to a brand of political (one sketch is about Syria) that’s seething, sarcastic and ridiculous at the same time. BLRead the full five-star reviewWhen Midsummer debuted at the Edinburgh fringe a decade ago, it was a quiet affair. Two actors on a stage with guitars, slowly falling in love. Today, David Greig’s explosive revival pairs young Bob and Helena (Sarah Higgins and Henry Pettigrew) with older versions of themselves (Benny Young and Eileen Nicholas) to create a joyful story of love, uncertainty and stupid decisions. A glorious tale of making the most of it. KWRead the full five-star reviewTraverse at Jeelie Piece cafe, 8pm, until 26 AugustTucked in a cafe off the edge of the Meadows in Edinburgh, a roomful of strangers stare down at their phones. Perched at a corner table, Terry (Terry O’Donovan) gets a text, and our phones vibrate. Terry’s ex-boyfriend Luka has passed away. His screen is shared with ours, and we see the flood of condolence texts, calls and emails pile up from people he hasn’t spoken to in years. Having been named Luka’s online legacy executor with the new app Fidelis, Terry has to choose whether to keep or delete. Exploring intimacy and loneliness, User Not Found is a beautiful song of love and letting go. With a smart actor and live technology, User Not Found makes use of a newly intimate form of storytelling. KWRead the full four-star review“Theatre is dying. Garry is our only hope,” we’re told. Damien Warren-Smith plays Garry Starr: gangly of limb, quivering with sincerity, and frequently stripped down to nothing but a ruff. He’s here to rescue forsaken theatre by demonstrating every one of its genres in 60 minutes. You can almost hear theatre’s heart come pounding back to life – but defibrillation has seldom been this uproarious. BLRead the full four-star review hereThe playground is a battlefield. Max and his best mate, Stevie, know that more than most. They’re the boys ducking punches and running from bullies, the boys who try to talk tough but feel scared. And for the hour we spend with them in Kieran Hurley and Gary McNair’s new play, they’re the boys hiding out in the school loos, waiting for Max’s imminent fight – his square go – with resident tough guy Danny. CLRead the full four-star review“I’m the riskiest comic in the biz,” Jordan Brookes boasts in his new show, Bleed. Then he tells us again, and again, until the phrase collapses into gibberish, and his self-esteem collapses, too. Last year’s gripping show Body of Work, nominated for the Edinburgh comedy award, had many hailing Brookes in just those terms. But on the evidence of this follow-up, which is even better, success won’t go to his head. There can’t be much room in there, after all, what with self-loathing, images of violence, playful impulses and limitless ideas for how to subvert a comedy show all jostling for attention. BLRead the full four-star reviewTime to bow our heads and contemplate the passing of inanimate objects. Let us remember the one-eyed space creatures consumed by monsters on German TV, the plastic farm animals strewn to the ground by careless children and the hot-headed balloon man who breathed in too deeply. These and many other death scenes are taken from the “greatest puppet shows in history” by Canada’s Old Trout Puppet Workshop with a style that goes from Looney Toons to Edward Gorey and all points in between. It’s as funny as it is inventive – perfect festival fodder – and all the richer for the darkness and poignancy that grows out of the laughter. MFPart modern murder mystery, part romantic ballet classic, this is a zippy reworking of the big 19th-century Giselle. Splicing enough pointe and arabesque drama into 100 minutes to validate its full-scale provenance, choreographer Ludovic Oniela (formerly of the Royal Ballet) takes a chamber group of 11 from Ireland’s national company on a contemporary urban glide down love’s slippery slope. ABRead the full three-star reviewMemories of Liam Williams’ debut five years ago are stirred by this rookie set from Rob Oldham. The younger comic occupies similar territory, somewhere between depression, wry humour and millennial existential angst. He contrasts his relatively privileged, meaningless life with that of his grandad. One fought a war, the other sits at home talking to his dog and failing to write a novel. In lieu of that magnum opus, we get “tonal prose poems” about being young in 2001, sardonic alternatives to Brexit, and potshots at listicle culture. Sometimes it’s a bit underpowered. One or two routines (a strong one about, er, guns and butt-plugs a more generic bit on the bronze age) seem to belong in a different show. But Worm’s Lament remains a vivid snapshot of being young and half-alive in the 21st century, and whets the appetite to see what Oldham will do next. BLThose who shoot from the hip can easily shoot themselves in the foot, but Fin Taylor seems happy to take that risk. He is one of those provocateur comics whose fearless plain speaking can shade into shock-jockery. But he’s a lively watch and often worth listening to: in recent years on the subjects of race and leftwing tribalism, and now – hold on to your hats! – on post-#MeToo gender politics. He strikes a decent balance between having fun, teasing at bien pensant limits and trying to progress the conversation on gender. Amid the garish sex comedy and loud disdain for fashionable opinion, he is making a striking effort to embrace the complexity of modern sexual behaviour. BLRead the full four-star reviewNew Zealand standup Alice Snedden makes her fringe debut with Self-Titled, and its keynote is confidenc, the show’s subject and its defining characteristic. Nothing about Snedden’s cool and capable delivery says debutante, as she talks us through her home-birth photo album, her sexually overactive parents and her unprecedentedly low Uber rating. There’s a great gag about PMS, too. Through it all, she sends up her self-satisfaction with a lovely light touch, but never backs away from it, as her short set comes up to date with some sacrilegious reflections on #MeToo. There are a couple of weak routines, but one of them is redeemed, as Snedden hits us with a crowd-pleasing party-piece finale. BLIt is a potent cocktail: a goofy interactive comedy about a macho “douchebag”, with a confrontational sting in its tale. Nate starts superbly, as Palamides – disguised under a lumberjack coat, biker boots, shaggy moustache and marker-pen chest hair – motorbikes on stage to a cock-rock soundtrack. She is chugging cans, toting fake phalluses and flaunting her 2D masculinity. BLRead the full four-star reviewThomas made his name as a leftwing agitator, needling pomposity, fighting injustice, righting wrongs. There’s no edge missing here, but his boyish enthusiasm is a reminder that he is foremost a humanist. He makes a smooth transition, in Nicholas Kent’s carefully paced production, from a celebration of the NHS in its 70th-birthday year to a critique of the complacency, underinvestment and creeping privatisation that is poised to bring it down. MFRead the full four-star reviewIn the Alice-in-Wonderland logic of the National Rifle Association, “guns don’t kill people, people do”. Martín Zimmerman’s On the Exhale is an attempt to get under the skin of a debate that tells you more about America’s fraught relationship with its history and constitution than it does about reasoned argument. In this story about a bereaved mother, there is a mesmerising performance by Polly Frame. Still, matter-of-fact and measured, her delivery is gripping in its economy and hits home like a bullet. MFRead the full four-star reviewIan Kershaw’s science-fiction fantasy follows an apparently accidental romance that turns out to have been written in the stars. What makes it special, in Raz Shaw’s good-looking production, is the superb performance of Julie Hesmondhalgh as the unnamed narrator, meticulously colouring in the stories of neighbours, friends and love rivals whom she identifies by the footwear she finds in the shoeboxes of Naomi Kuyck Cohen’s set – and also by the shoes she borrows from a willing audience. MFRead the full three-star reviewArguments about Europe, sovereignty, Britain’s place in the world – they’ve all happened before, says Kieran Hodgson. The 2016 referendum was just a cover version. In his new show, ’75, the two-time Edinburgh comedy award nominee traces the roots of our current Brexit malaise back to the 60s and 70s. Few comedy shows since Mike Yarwood’s heyday have leaned so heavily on impersonations of Barbara Castle, Roy Jenkins and Ted Heath. But if Hodgson’s latest is research-heavy – a quality he cheerfully sends up – it’s never fusty. He has created a set that’s enlightening, heartfelt and jam-packed with funny. BLRead the full four-star review“I thought I’d be called,” says Sarah Morris as Donna, as she stumbles apologetically into Mr McCafferty’s classroom. Despite being 29, when she wants to ask a question she instinctively raises her hand. Stephen Jones as her estranged husband, Brian, is scarcely more confident, though he has a bullish swagger to cover his insecurity. In Iseult Golden and David Horan’s fraught and quarrelsome three-hander, this primary school represents a schism. It is not just about the educated and the unread, but the haves and the have-nots. In a society organised to benefit the better off, the school is the site of class warfare. MFRead the full four-star reviewDavid Ireland’s heady black comedy is a satire as timely as it is riotous. If Jacobean revenge tragedies were played as uproarious comedy, they’d look like this. It’s rare to hear an audience repeatedly gasp out loud at the wince-inducing action on stage. Like Jerry Sadowitz, Ireland can make you laugh and doubt the wisdom of your laughter at the same time. MFRead the full five-star reviewIn this dystopian satire, to deviate from the politically correct rules is to initiate social and professional suicide. B (Katherine Pearce) makes a misjudged joke and trips into a world of cultural landmines and magnified consequences. B’s caricaturish colleagues live in a perpetual state of forced, grim wokeness, wearing anonymous suits and tight corporate grins. Under Stef O’Driscoll’s direction, virtue signalling becomes a tangible action: every time an actor says a particular word, their arms wave or knees dip like exaggerated air quotations. The absence of banned words makes the audience fill in the gaps, and allows for the debate to work for any social issue. Let’s start talking to each other, the play begs, before our words start slapping us across the face. KWRead the full three-star reviewThe unnamed setting of Simon Longman’s play is a dead-end place, robbed of jobs and hope, where getting drunk is the only way to pass the time. Sam’s focused on survival, while Pete just wants to get laid. Only Kate plans to escape – if the town will let her. In the encircling space of Paines Plough’s Roundabout theatre, Stef O’Driscoll’s staging creates a clammy sense of imprisonment, making us feel the constraints of geography and circumstance. Kate, Sam and Pete are vivid personas from the moment we meet them, slugging cider and taking the piss out of each other. The laughs keep coming until suddenly, with a shock, they start to feel like kicks to the gut.

There’s a lot to notice. I gaze across meadows speckled golden with buttercups. Dry-stone walls carve the fields into tiny fiefdoms, each with its own stone barn. The low hill we’ve just descended is washed by a panoply of greens. Somewhere above us a skylark is singing its little heart out in a worthy attempt to fill the broad valley with song. Nothing strikes me as untoward.“We’re the only ones here,” says Jonathan. “We’ve hardly seen anyone all day, have we? I find it so frustrating – there’s all this beauty and yet there’s almost no one here to enjoy it.”And he’s right. For two days, Jonathan Smith – a local walking guide and author – has taken me up and down some extremely attractive hills and vales in the Yorkshire Dales national park – in glorious weather, and yet we’ve seen very few other walkers.Slim of limb and silver of mane, with more than a touch of Arsène Wenger about him, Jonathan is on a mission to get people exploring beyond the famous Three Peaks (Ingleborough, Pen-y-ghent and Whernside). To that end, he guides walkers around the lesser-known dales runs navigation courses to give hikers the confidence to get off the beaten track and has written a book – The Dales 30 – a guide to mostly circular walking routes to the top of all 30 of the park’s 610-metre-plus hills. He’s one of a hiking elite who have climbed all of Scotland’s 282 Munros (peaks above 914 metres) but dreamed up the Dales 30 as a “more doable challenge” achievable by anyone who can climb a hill.I like to think I’ve done my share of thigh-testing ascents around Britain. But I found I could claim a mere three of the Dales 30, so on our first day, Jonathan takes me to Upper Wharfedale to add a fourth – his favourite hill, Buckden Pike.“It’s a proper hill,” he says. “It has a proper summit and yet it’s a fairly gentle climb along a path of lovely springy turf.”It also provides magnificent views from its 702-metre top. Jonathan pointed out all of the Three Peaks, and a host of hills and ranges beyond. We made a short pilgrimage to a Polish war memorial – commemorating a 1942 plane crash – before slipping back down to Buckden village on another flank, passing long-abandoned lead mines and soaking up views of Upper Wharfedale. We’d walked five miles, but it felt like we’d explored a new little world.I spent the night in nearby Kettlewell. Protected to the east by the dramatic bulk of Great Whernside (another of the Dales 30, with a footpath right to the top), it’s preposterously picturesque. It feels as if its stone cottages, elegant church, plashy stream and venerable pubs have been ordered by a movie mogul who called for the finest points of every Dales village to be condensed into this one. I slept at the friendly Zarina’s B\u0026ampB, in a low-beamed bedroom that felt like a set from Kettlewell’s exquisite film.Next day we conquered mighty Birks Fell (607 metres), on a seven-mile walk in two lesser-known dales. Beginning at Hubberholme – little more than a pub, a church and a farm – in Langstrothdale, we followed the River Wharfe to Yockenthwaite, with its Monet-esque hay meadows. We climbed the sinkhole-pocked Horse Head pass and down into deserted Littondale, pausing for a drink at Katie’s Cuppas – a self-servicehonesty-box cafe at Halton Gill. Rolling happily along the bank of the Skirfare, we passed through pretty Litton village and on to the steep bridleway for a full-frontal assault on Birks Fell.Back at Hubberholme, the sun was well over the yardarm, so we had a pint at The George – favourite watering hole of playwright and author JB Priestley and the sort of tiny, remote, characterful pub it’s hard to believe exists any more.Why, I wondered, doesn’t Jonathan want to keep such choice spots to himself. • The trip was provided by where2walk: a day’s guiding for up to 10 adults costs £180 (dogs and kids welcome).

I went on my first\u0026nbspdiet when I was eight years old. For as long as I can remember, I’ve been hungry.”For anyone operating under the misapprehension that millennial TV is all group hugs and wokeness, Lauren Gussis’s comedy about a bullied fat girl who gets thin and wreaks revenge on her persecutors will set them straight. Not only is it front-loaded with gags about child molestation, homosexuality and homelessness, it has taken the bold decision to exhume that totem of 90s and early-00s comedy: the fat suit. Little wonder that, upon the release of last month’s trailer, Insatiable became an instant outrage generator, yielding foaming thinkpieces about fat-shaming, and an online petition demanding for it to be pulled by Netflix. All of which, at the very least, makes it a triumph of publicity over plotting.To the story, then, which sees the teenage Patty get into an altercation with a stranger, ending in her being punched in the face. To fix the damage, Patty’s jaw is wired shut for three months, prompting her to emerge from her summer break a svelte size eight and, in the eyes of her classmates, drop-dead gorgeous. Being desirable is not enough for Patty, who wants the world to suffer for her pain. But then she meets Bob (Dallas Roberts), a lawyer and kindred spirit scarred by his own teenage weight issues, and whose side-hustle as a beauty pageant coach has been sunk by false accusations of groping. While Bob sees Patty as his route back into the pageant game, the angry, insecure Patty sees fortysomething, balding Bob as her soulmate.\u0026nbspIt would take years of therapy to unpick the layers of distress that have led Bob and Patty to one other – and that’s before we start on the supporting characters. These include Bob’s wife Coralee (Alyssa Milano), who, having buried her trailer-trash beginnings, craves acceptance from the middle-class, suburban wives and Nonnie (Kimmy Shields), a closet lesbian who longs for Patty to love her for who she really is.\u0026nbspThere are several problems with Insatiable: poor pacing, vying storylines, character inconsistencies … I could go on. But let’s be clear: being fat is not the joke here, and no one is equating thinness with contentment. Instead, Patty’s transformation is the springboard for a spiky comedy about self-image, what we choose to hide from the world and why. “If you’re feeling bad for me, don’t,” says Patty. “All those years I spent feeling miserable, they made me who I am.” And who is she? A clever, confused, furious, inconsistent, occasionally violent teenager in the midst of an identity crisis.While some of the gags are written to make you flinch – “He’s a child molester,” says Nonnie, trying to warn Patty off Bob. “Which means I might have a shot,” comes the reply – Insatiable does not discriminate in its misanthropic worldview. No one is being singled out, since everyone here hates themselves. Stand down, outrage police: this is equal-opportunities self-loathing.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4de62ce55ec77eae6ade84daab56fd1b03e55168/0_455_3341_2004/master/3341.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8924367320f291ceca7863801c1108e8","title":"an art tour of las vegas from murals and movies to magic mountains","story":"Step away from the more obvious attractions and there are true cultural highlights to be found in Vegas, with large-scale street art, permanent exhibitions and installations. You’ll even find the work of leading artists in some of the hotelsArt might not be the first thing that springs to mind when you think of Las Vegas, but the city has a long and distinguished relationship with art, whether that’s exhibiting the world’s legendary artists, muralists using a hotel as a canvas, or even the neon pop art of the city itself. Detox from the extravagance and excitement and take a trip into the cultural heart of Vegas.Street artSome of the best art in Vegas is free – you simply need to take a stroll downtown to find works by top street artists and muralists. Many of the pieces, which unexpectedly crop up on the sides of otherwise nondescript buildings, were commissioned by the annual Life is Beautiful festival. The festival was also involved in creating the huge wall paintings – the largest in town – that adorn the Plaza hotel and casino. Cultivate Harmony, an abstract design by Shepard Fairey (the founder of Obey clothing who is famed for his Barack Obama Hope poster from the 2008 presidential election), covers one side of this 21-storey tower block. Splashed across another side is a bold riff on comic books and pop art by British artist D*Face, while the most recent addition is by Brooklyn duo Faile who took the famous painting of Dogs Playing Poker by Cassius Marcellus Coolidge as inspiration.Meanwhile, over at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, a permanent exhibition celebrates the best street art. As well as Fairey, there is work by the likes of RETNA, an LA artist known for his hieroglyphic graffiti and collaborations with Louis Vuitton and Nike and Kenny Scharf, who rose to prominence in the East Village art scene during the 1980s alongside Jean-Michel Basquiat. In a neat twist that reflects the urban bloodline of the works, the murals are displayed in the resort’s utilitarian spaces, such as the car park and stairwells. Neon artVegas by night makes for an iconic panorama and for the folks at the Neon Museum it makes for art as well. For more than 20 years the museum has been collecting and exhibiting signage from old casinos and hotels. On site are some 260 signs, including classics from the likes of Caesars Palace, Golden Nugget and Stardust. A one-hour guided tour takes visitors through nearly 90 years of lighting history, while the shorter Brilliant! multimedia show incorporates music, a light show and archival footage.Desert artSeven Magic Mountains is an installation by Swiss multimedia artist Ugo Rondinone – though you won’t find it in any gallery or urban space, but in the desert near Jean Dry Lake. Made from locally sourced boulders, it is formed of seven DayGlo painted towers stacked 9-metres (30ft) high. The site, a short drive south of the city but very much in the middle of nowhere, was picked for its historical resonance. Nearby is the spot where the Los Angeles and Salt Lake railroad was completed in 1905, an event that paved the way for the founding of Las Vegas. Commissioned in 2016, Seven Magic Mountains was scheduled to remain on view for two years, though the artist hopes to keep it available to the public for longer. For now, it is on view until the end of 2018.Movie artLas Vegas is no stranger to glitz and glamour, which is reflected in the aptly named The Golden Age of Glam, an exhibition at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas that celebrates the city’s entertainment history. Curated from 65 years of archives of the Las Vegas News Bureau, the exhibit includes photos and video, featuring a roll call of Vegas greats, including Liberace, Marilyn Maxwell, Mae West and Frankie Laine.Trad artThe Marjorie Barrick Museum of Art, part of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, houses major contemporary art collections, as well as artifacts and visual arts from local indigenous traditions and Mesoamerica. It’s also custodian of the extensive Las Vegas Art Museum collection, which features internationally-renowned artists such as Llyn Foulkes, a significant and groundbreaking painter since the 1960s, and William T Wiley, whose 50-plus year career has seen solo exhibitions at the Smithsonian and Museum of Modern Art (New York). Rotating exhibits feature contemporary works across a variety of media, including Colosseum, a stereoscopic 3D film by Berlin-based artist Moritz Fehr and Edward Burtynsky’s Oil series of large-scale photographs.Hotel artIt’s also possible to experience world-class art without leaving your hotel. As well as a wondrous glass flower ceiling by Dale Chihuly in its lobby, the Bellagio houses its own fine art gallery, which puts on a rotating series of shows featuring 20th-century masters such as Picasso, Warhol and Lichtenstein. The Aria also has its own art collection that s painting, sculpture and installations, featuring work by renowned artists such as Henry Moore, Frank Stella, Jenny Holzer and Richard Long."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4048f93260df0d8d85573fbe6bc614ed4595edc9/0_10_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74c5a9e5667a91e8ed2153eff63575ce","title":"selfish selfie takers spark trevi fountain fisticuffs","story":"Eight-person fight ensues after tourists battle for best spot in front of Roman monumentThe quest of two tourists for a perfect selfie has sparked a brawl at Rome’s famous Trevi fountain.Fighting broke out after a 19-year-old woman from Holland and a 44-year-old Italian-American woman wanted to take their selfies at a prime spot in front of the monument at the same time.The incident happened on Wednesday evening, a time of day when the light makes the monument a perfect backdrop.What started as an exchange of words between the women became a physical fight and then their respective family members joined in.Neither of the women wanted to give way over the selfie spot, the newspaper La Repubblica reported.

Photograph:  Sebastien CourdjiPool via ReutersThe British government asked Ireland to ease off on its emphasis on peace in Northern Ireland as one of the main issues at stakes in the Brexit talks.The request, from representatives of the UK administration, was made in recent months because British prime minister Theresa May was said to be hurt and concerned her credentials as a guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement were not being taken seriously, sources disclosed. However, Dublin did not accede to the call because of a view that the peace process should remain central to the Brexit negotiations.The revelation comes as Mrs May steps up preparations for the UK leaving the bloc without a deal. She is reported to have instructed her officials to make contingencies in such a scenario to ensure the Border is free of customs checks and police.It is understood the request came in meetings between figures from the Irish and UK governments as Mrs May was preparing to secure the backing of her Cabinet for her vision of a future relationship with the European Union after Brexit.The UK government published its white paper on its preferred future relationship last month, which set out a common customs area between the EU and UK, as well as Britain remaining aligned to the European single market for goods.However, its key measures have been met with opposition from the EU. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has also said that the integrity of the EU single market – and the accompanying commitment to the free movement of goods, services, people and capital – must be respected. On the message from the British government on the emphasis on peace and the Irish border, a source said: “Successive Irish and British governments have protected a hard-won peace in Northern Ireland and we need to make sure that continues, regardless of Brexit.” This includes a need for no hard Border.Another Dublin figure said the UK government felt that the peace process and Irish Border were being seen as mostly of concern to “nationalists, Dublin and the EU”, but were equally a concern of unionists and Mrs May’s minority Conservative administration, which has a confidence and supply agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). In a letter to members of the Conservative Party in recent days, Mrs May said she “remained clear that no deal is better than a bad deal – and we are stepping up our ‘no deal’ preparations”. Among her commitments, Mrs May said: “There will be no hard Border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. We will remain one United Kingdom with a single internal market.” She said the two options on offer from the EU – a “standard” free trade agreement “with Northern Ireland staying in the customs union and parts of the single market” or UK membership of the customs union and single market – are “unacceptable”. The wording of the so-called “backstop” arrangement – which would guarantee no hard border even in a no deal Brexit scenario – is one the main sticking points in EU-UK talks, which Mrs May said have reached an “impasse”. The EU has said that without a backstop, there can be no withdrawal agreement – threatening a “no-deal” Brexit where the UK crashes out of the EU next March.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Tim O’BrienA family who bought a former Garda station within the Dublin commuter belt for €6,000 from the Office of Public Works has said it may rent out the building as holiday accommodation.The former Garda station at Crossakiel, Co Meath, which was sold in June 2015, was just one of 42 former Garda stations sold between 2014 and 2016. Their sale netted the State €3.228 million.The former station at Crossakiel is a small pitched-roof building with just three rooms including kitchen and toilet facilities. It appears well maintained and in good condition. It is located on a hill looking towards the Loughcrew Cairns, a tourism attraction.According to Peter McCann of local auctioneers Martin Shortt, the former station is firmly within the Dublin commuter belt, being “five minutes” or about the same number of kilometres from the northern end of the M3 motorway to Dublin.Mr McCann is seeking €185,000 to €190,000 for a house in a development called The Cairns, across the road from the former Garda station. At €6,000 the price paid is comparable to three months rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Dublin 2.Jim Murphy, who bought the building, told The  his family may use it for holiday accommodation, perhaps for people attending weddings at the Crover House Hotel on Lough Sheelin. The building is currently used by Mr Murphy and his family as storage.It is understood the OPW initially asked Mr Murphy for €10,000 for the building in early 2015. But, despite the attractive price, the family did not jump at the deal. Mr Murphy said the electricity cables for the premises came across from his own house and the two properties shared the same sewage facilities. “There was lots of clauses in the sale – they really couldn’t sell it to anyone else,” he said.The €6,000 sales price figure, along with the figures for the other 41 stations sold between 2014 and 2016, was given to Fianna Fáil justice spokesman Jim O’Callaghan by Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Paschal Donohoe, in reply to a written parliamentary question in July. Mr O’Callaghan criticised the sales, saying they had generated “small money” and “deprived the public of strategically important buildings”.Among the stations on the list was Ballacolla Station in Co Laois which was sold in September 2016 for €15,000 Ballinahown in Co Westmeath which made €20,00 in January 2016 and Rathowen station in Co Westmeath – some 98km from Dublin city – which sold for €15,000 in June 2015.The former station at Baldwinstown in Co Wexford, a five-bay, two-storey building listed on the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, was sold for €75,000 in March 2014.At the upper end of the scale was Lauragh Garda station, near Glanmore Lake and Derreen Gardens, on the edge of Kenmare Bay in Co Kerry, which made €115,000 in February 2016. The building, which sits well back from the road, was refurbished by the OPW in 2007 at a cost of €57,370 which included a tarmacadam drive.In 2008 Lauragh Garda station was refurbished again at a cost of €58,617 and works included reslating of the roof of an outhouse, fitting of doors, tiling, bathroom works and installation of intruder and of fire detection alarms. In 2010 the OPW spent €9,988, which was described as “works to galvanised gates”. In all the refurbishment cost more then €125,000 before the station was sold for €115,000.It is understood the OPW was obliged under the terms on which it acquired the property, to offer the premises to the Derreen Estate. Jamie Bigham, whose family owns the estate, said it was “a matter of public record that the estate had to get it back”."},{"url":null,"title":"opw cannot explain conflicting figures for garda station sales","story":"The OPW has said it cannot explain why the sale prices given by a senior government Minister for some former Garda stations differ from the sale prices recorded on the State’s Property Price Register.In a number of cases sale price figures provided by Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Paschal Donohoe, to Fianna Fáil justice spokesman Jim O’Callaghan in the Dáil, differed from the prices recorded on the register. The register is maintained by the statutory Property Services Regulatory Authority and records the sale price as declared to the Revenue Commissioners for the purpose of stamp duty. In addition to the discrepancies, many of the Garda station sales listed on Mr Donohoe’s list of 43 properties have yet to appear on the Property Price Register. In one example, Lauragh Garda station in Co Kerry was, according to information provided by Mr Donohoe, sold on February 16th, 2016, for €115,000. Yet the figure recorded on the Property Price Register was €50,000. Jamie Bingham whose family own the Derreen Estate near Kenmare which bought the property, said he could not explain the discrepancy. “I have no idea why that might be,” he said. In another case, Cloone Garda station in Co Leitrim was said by Mr Donohoe to have achieved a sale price of €50,000, but the reported price on the Property Price Register was €40,000. Mr O’Callaghan, who tabled the Dáil question on the sale of Garda stations, said he too could not explain the discrepancy in the State’s figures. He will ask a further question in the Dáil about it, he said. The OPW said the Residential Property Price Register “holds the date of sale, price and address of residential properties purchased since January 2010, as declared by the purchaser to the Revenue Commissioners for the purposes of stamp duty”. It added: “The data is provided by persons conveyancing a property on behalf of the purchaser. Therefore, the data entered on the register in this case is not a matter for the OPW.” A spokesman for the Revenue Commissioners said it could not comment on inidual tax cases. The Property Price Register is maintained by the Property Services Regulatory Authority. In a statement last night, a spokeswoman for the authority said the register contains two entries under the address of Lauragh Garda Station, one dated February 2016 with a sale price of €50,000 and a second entry dated February 2017 also with a sale price of €50,000. “This Register is compiled from data which is filed, for stamp duty purposes, with the Revenue Commissioners,” she said.“The data is primarily filed electronically by persons doing the conveyancing of the property on behalf of the purchaser. The PSRA does not in any way edit the data. It simply publishes, in a fully transparent manner, the data from the declarations which are filed with the Revenue Commissioners. Barry Ward, a barrister, however suggested last night the discrepancy in the figures may be connected with the fact the residential property price register is focussed specifically on residential properties and many of the rural Garda stations sold may have included both residential and commercial elements. The commercial elements wouldn’t have been captured on the register. Since 2014, including Garda stations, the OPW disposed of 32 properties by public auction, 42 properties were sold by private treaty and three properties were transferred to other State bodies."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3584276.1533214652!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"united ireland the south of ireland doesn t want us and can t afford us","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer first minister Peter Robinson at the MacGill Summer School in Glenties. Photograph: North West NewspixOmagh man Kevin Skelton shakes his head when asked what he thinks about former DUP leader Peter Robinson’s advice to unionists that they need to think about preparing for a Border poll which could lead to Irish unity.He later pleaded guilty in an Irish court to unlawful assembly, and paid a large fine, thus avoiding a jail term but earning the nickname, Peter the Punt. “I know what I’d do with a Border poll, where I’d push it,” says Skelton.“I couldn’t give a hoot, couldn’t care less. The south of Ireland doesn’t want us, doesn’t need us and can’t afford us. If the vote was held on both sides of the Border they’d likely reject us. Peter Robinson and Mary Lou McDonald would be better putting their time into getting the assembly back together. There’s none of them wants to deal with the past.”Skelton’s wife Mena was one of the 31 people (including unborn twins) murdered in Omagh when the Real IRA’s massive 1998 carbomb exploded without warning on Main Street. Prepared in the Republic, it had been driven north, passing through Clontibret, and across the border into Tyrone.Relatives and friends are bracing themselves for the 20th anniversary on the 15th of this month. The views of the survivors are as erse as the backgrounds from which their loved ones came and Skelton does not claim to speak for anyone other than himself, though his anger at what he sees as the neglect of the victims is widely shared. He thinks a Border poll is irrelevant, and that Brexit is the critical issue.“My fear is that Brexit could start the Troubles up again. I’d be out of here if there was a hard border,” he said. However, he also believes that the real Border in Northern Ireland is the river Bann. The newly released NI statistics on deprivation support his view that the most prosperous areas are in the northeast, with the western Border areas among the most disadvantaged.“Omagh was already struggling on the shavings from the table, and it never recovered from the bomb,” said Skelton. “It is well on its way to being a ghost town.”Further north and further west, the city of Derry has lately been in the news because of a flare up of street violence among young people under the influence of dissident republicans. The violence included sectarian attacks on the Fountain estate, a tiny unionist enclave alongside the old city walls on the by now almost entirely nationalist west bank of the river Foyle.On Wednesday night a remarkably civil and wideranging debate took place on the other side of the river, the largely unionist Waterside, in a Protestant church hall. Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald and DUP MP and chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson were among the speakers discussing the future of the Northern state.The event was one of 40 in the New Gate Fringe Festival, organised by the North West Cultural Partnership, which includes the Londonderry Bands Forum the membership of which is drawn from young men from some of the most deprived loyalist estates in the region. Public debates including working class nationalists and republicans have long been a feature of Northern political life. An audience predominantly made up, as this one was, of working class unionists is far more rare.“What’s your take, Sir Jeffrey?” said June Elder. Donaldson said the DUP was very clear on the question. “Peter does not speak for the DUP. He is retired. I do,” he said. “I don’t share his view.”Considering such a poll would polarise people and cause further ision, he had not had a single email from a constituent about it. “We are preparing for Brexit.”Elder came back after his response with a supplementary question. “So was Peter just off on a rant?” she asked. “No,” said Donaldson with a tight smile. “He was expressing his opinion.”“Well,” retorted Elder, sceptically, to laughter. “My TV shows the same as yours.”Joe Thompson said he was a unionist but he was angry with the DUP. “For decades they’ve insisted this part of the country is British and now with Brexit they say it can’t be treated any differently from England, Scotland and Wales,” he said. “But people are treated differently when it comes to reproductive rights, marriage rights and the Irish language act.”Donaldson said devolution meant that different parts of the UK would have different laws. He said the place to legislate for the issues Thompson raised was at Stormont and reiterated his party leader Arlene Foster’s accusation that Sinn Féin was “holding to ransom” the parties which wished to resume powersharing. “We no longer have a veto,” he said, pointing out that to use a “petition of concern” to block new legislation 30 votes were needed. “We only have 28,” he said.McDonald retorted that Foster had just that morning backed the use of a blocking mechanism to prevent a local council from flying the rainbow flag this weekend, Saturday August 4th, as part of LGBTQ Pride events around the North.Afterwards, Thompson, who works in Derry and lives in Mid Ulster, told The  he was not satisfied with Donaldson’s response. “The DUP is coming across as just so arrogant,” he said. “They’d get their 30 votes to block progressive change – they know it and so do we. I support the union but I vote Alliance now. Peter Robinson was right to say what he did about a Border poll. It is going to happen and the chaos that followed the Brexit vote showed that we need preparations.”The audience at the debate strikingly included many young people. On his way out after an intense 2½ hours, Chris Smith said a Border poll would be pointless. “It is not a question people need answered,” he said. “I am a unionist and I want the politicians either to get Stormont up and running or go back to Direct Rule. As it is we are losing out every way. My girlfriend works in the NHS here and she has just had to forego a payrise that colleagues elsewhere are getting. My mate is a firefighter but because of cuts his job is about to be lost.”Julia Kee, a community worker on a programme made possible by the EU’s Peace 4 funding, shared this view. “We have more important things to be thinking about than a Border poll,” she said. “I am a unionist and we have been hearing nothing but this anti-choice, anti-LGBT rights talk from the DUP.“The political impasse is creating political unrest around Northern Ireland including here in this city,” she said. “Then you get politicians calling young people scumbags and that does not help.”Hospital consultant Fergal McNicholl is from Greysteel, the Co Derry village which became internationally known after loyalists burst into a pub there in 1993 and sprayed it with gunfire, killing eight people. He came to the debate at the invitation of his friend, Dave Duggan, a writer from the city.“I felt quite privileged to be here tonight,” said McNicholl. “It was very impressive that they got a mixed audience and the fact that there was no tension was a massive step forward.” He was not inclined to favour preparing for a Border poll. “The territorial issue puts our identity back into conflict – I quite like it the way it was,” he said. “There was a period where I felt I could be comfortably Irish in this town and live beside someone who was comfortably British. Brexit has already raised territorial issues. It makes things harder. It unsettles us.”Georgina Campbell is a young dancer. She told the panel that she was worried and wanted to know if, in a new Ireland, the likes of her would have a place. She said that the Highland dancing that is her medium is rooted in British military history and that the highest honour available is to dance for the queen. Afterwards, she explained that a Border poll meant nothing to her.“We should just have a government,” she said. “My three best friends are nationalist girls who are self-employed artists. Highland dancers and Irish dancers work together on a regular basis, but a lot of our cultural activities are in our own communities. Northern Ireland is unique and special. We need to embrace it and we need to market it. It is just this big mad eclectic place. I love it so much – I’ll never move away.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3578359.1532700124!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the history of the kettle","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn electric kettle changes electrical energy into heat, which is just another form of energy the heat then boils the water. Photograph: Bryan O’Brien During the recent heat wave I realised just how assimilated to Ireland I have become. No, it wasn’t because I complained that the temperature was too high just three days in. It was because I kept making cups of tea, hot cups of tea. Somehow in 17 years a beverage I just about tolerated in cold weather became suitable refreshment for any weather. This got me thinking about the technology that I use to make my tea. I imagine that almost every household in Ireland owns an electric kettle. They are, to my continued surprise, not very popular in the United States. One of the earliest uses of electricity to power a small household appliance, the kettle hasn’t changed very much in over 50 years.An electric kettle changes electrical energy into heat (just another form of energy), the heat then boils the water. Heat is generated by passing an electrical current through a material that provides resistance. The bottom of the kettle is generally where heat is created, replacing the fire over which it might have been boiled. The use of electricity to produce “clean” heat in the home expanded in the 1880s with a particular focus on cooking technologies such as electric stoves. However, it was not until the 20th century that the availability of household wiring and the lower price of electricity made home electrical appliances more attractive. Small appliances were connected at a lamp socket, in place of the lamps that represented the first use of electricity in homes.Early electric kettles look exactly like standard kettles except with a flex attached. They were not as efficient as current kettles, taking perhaps 20 minutes to boil. One model, the Prometheus kettle from the turn of the century, can still be found as an antique. In 1929, the ESB advertised a copper “electric automatic safety kettle” that looked much like the Prometheus of 30 years before. They enticed customers with the promise that the kettle “will not get black” and was “absolutely clean because electricity heats without flame”.The automatic safety element the ESB advertised was one of the first modifications of the design. Prior to its introduction, it was possible to boil the kettle dry causing the kettle to fail and risking an electrical fire. Yet the safety device created its own problems. A person whose kettle had stopped working was tempted to investigate the cause of the failure themselves. Death by electrocution often followed. A series of articles in the British Medical Journal as late as the 1960s suggested that women over 60 were particularly vulnerable to electrocution “due to the use of scissors in the investigation of the connectors of electric irons and kettles”. One doctor even described the electric kettle with its safety device as “a booby trap for old ladies”.Unbeknown to the old ladies and indeed their old doctors, a modified safety switch was already available. The new switch, one that we tea drinkers are familiar with from its happy click, was operated by steam and turned off the kettle once it had boiled. The kettle did not boil dry nor did it short circuit and those thirsty for tea were not tempted to poke at wiring with the nearest available pointed object. By the 1960s the electric tea kettle was a standard, and safe, home appliance.If you are intrigued by the history of household technologies then I recommend a visit to Johnstown Castle in Co Wexford. The gardens are beautiful for a walk and you can even feed the peacocks. But if you fancy a break from the heat, or you’re lucky enough to get a rainy day, the museum is well worth a visit. Billed as an agricultural museum, this is in many ways really a museum of the history of technology. There is plenty of technology relating to farming from early tractors to milking machines to pesticide spreaders. On the very top floor, almost at the end of the exhibition is an exploration of household technologies. You can compare model kitchens pre and post electrification and read about a variety of different home electrical devices and their introduction. And then you can go downstairs to refresh yourself with a cup of tea and an excellent scone.

We wrote to the provincial health secretary asking him to restrict these two drugs from the area. I think it\u0027s good news for vultures.”The Chief Drug Inspector of Sindh has ordered regional and district drug inspectors to restrict the use of aceclofenac and ketoprofen..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Without vultures, the numbers of mammalian scavengers increases, which increases the potential for disease transmissionPakistan Vulture Restoration ProjectThe Pakistan Vulture Restoration Project (PVRP) led by Mr Iqba l has spent the past 12 years campaigning for the banning of the toxic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which cause kidney failure in the birds.A statement from the PVRP, which includes the UK\u0027s Hawk Conservancy Trust and the WWF, said vultures\u0027 collapse had “serious consequences for people”.Their waste removal service controls the populations of disease-carrying scavengers that are a threat to human health.“By suppressing the numbers of mammalian scavengers at carcasses, the potential for disease transmission is reduced. Without vultures, the numbers of mammalian scavengers increases, which increases the potential for disease transmission, threatening the health of humans and wildlife.”Vultures\u0027 removal of carrion leaves less food for other scavengers, such as dogs. A collapse in vulture numbers in India has been blamed for a huge rise in the feral dog population at the same time and a rise in rabies cases. Vultures strong digestive juices also allow them to eat diseased carrion, cleaning up carcasses that may be infected with deadly microbes.Where will the next pandemic come from? | The candidatesThe most common NSAID, diclofenac, was banned from veterinary use in Pakistan, India and Nepal in 2006. But vets have continued to use residual stockpiles and the similar drugs aceclofenac and ketoprofen have continued to pose a threat to the Gyps group of vultures, including white-backed vultures and long-billed vultures. Tens of millions are thought to have died in the past two decades across South Asia alone, cutting populations by somewhere between 95 and 99 per cent.Mr Iqbal said conservationists will conduct spot checks at vets to see if the restrictions have really cut back on the availability of the drugs, or whether they are still available on the black market.He has been carrying out research on vultures for more than 20 years. He said: “The populations are still declining. If this decline continues, we are afraid that these species will become extinct.”To try to stem the birds\u0027 decline, the PVRP has set up a breeding centre in Punjab province and a “vulture safe zone” in Sindh where some of the last colonies of white-backed and long-billed vultures can be found.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Ryanair strikes: what to do if your flight has been cancelled\u0026#34Enemy of the people\u0026#34?

Each of the acts will make new material and it will be a celebration of its (Royal Albert Hall\u0027s) history, with lots of references to classical music.Noble added: With our shows in the smaller spaces, and shows like Hacienda Classical and Wizkid, we\u0027ve been able to attract a younger, more erse audience. That\u0027s critical to the Hall\u0027s future — not just in terms of simple economics, but in enabling us to stay relevant.The Hall has been at the heart of social and cultural life in Britain since 1871, and that has involved being adaptable: open to new genres, new trends, and new ways of experiencing music.Sigma, the drum and bass duo, are among the most recent dance music performers to headline at the Albert Hall but the Innervisions gig, on September 21, will be the biggest event of its kind at the venue.Please review our commenting policyRyanair strikes: what to do if your flight has been cancelled\u0026#34Enemy of the people\u0026#34?

That’s 10 million more people than the entire population of the UK, and doesn’t take into account all those over the age of 25. Which, in a country where the illiteracy rate is something like 14 per cent, is frankly astonishing.And possibly crap. Here’s not some writing advice for you, but an honest-to-goodness law, as laid down by the science fiction author Theodore Sturgeon: 90 per cent\u0026nbspof everything is crap. Curiously, that’s the same percentage as the young population of America which wants to write a book. And –\u0026nbspthough I have as much scientific backup for this as Sturgeon did for his law –\u0026nbspthe same percentage of writing advice, I’d warrant, that also qualifies as crap.Why am I so down on writing advice? Because it’s often so prescriptive, as though there’s only one way to skin a cat. Which there isn’t. The reason a lot of us do genuinely like to hear about authors’ writing processes is because they’re very often wildly different from each other.If they were all the same –\u0026nbspand edicts about how you should and shouldn’t go about writing would wrongly suggest they are – then we’d only have to hear Neil Gaiman or Gillian Flynn or JK Rowling explain the process once at some book festival, and we’d know how everyone does it.It’s also rather annoying that writers feel the need to issue edicts, as though writing is actually some magical, special, superhuman process that mere mortals can only aspire to. Let’s get this right, writing a book isn’t easy. Writing a good book is harder still. Writing a book that is not just good, but great, and worthy of a publisher throwing money at you, is very, very difficult. But it’s also not rocket science, nor brain surgery. Which is evident by the almost complete absence of rocket scientists and brain surgeons offering Twitter advice on their particular disciplines.mojitos,’ Ernest reminded himselfAnd that may be because, apart from a few tweaks here and there, there really is only one way to science a rocket or surgeon a brain.There’s no room for experimentation, for doing it at your own pace, for finding your own path. Which – advice, ahoy! – are all things you should be doing if you decide to write a book.A couple of months ago the writer Flic Everett tweeted: “I wish plumbers were as fascinated by themselves as some writers are. They could post little ‘plumbing is so tough, need coffee!!’ memes and be all humble about their plumbing awards and recognise each other on Twitter via the hashtag #amplumbing”.You don’t get that much, do you? There is very rarely advice or bragging from plumbers along the lines of “You need to put at least one toilet in a week if you’re going to call yourself a pipe monkey!” or “sealed a dozen pipes with PTFE tape this weekend – no rest for the real plumber!”So I asked Twitter what sort of writing advice they see a lot which really annoys them. By far the most unpopular edict was the oft-trotted out, “You have to write every day.” The adjunct to this is usually that your daily output should generally be about 1,000 words.As with all writing advice, there’s a grain of common sense in it. If you are planning to write a book, then at some point you should actually, you know, put some words together. But there’s nothing enshrined in law that says you have to do this every single day, nor do the requisite 1,000 words, which could be three or four hours’ work, or more, for the fledgling writer.Women gain on men in Forbes list of top earning authorsThis is an example of the “advice” which some writers come out with which is disguised as inspirational but is actually thinly veiled macho bullshit designed to paint the author in question as some kind of tough-as-old-boots Hemingway-esque hard man of letters.Similarly, there are many pronouncements that to be a writer you have to give up all of your free time. Again, a kernel of truth novels don’t write themselves. You’re going to have to steal that time from somewhere, whether it’s foregoing Love Island or getting up an hour earlier, or going to bed an hour later.\u0026nbspBut I saw a Friday tweet recently saying something along the lines of, oh, it’s the weekend again, or as we writers know it, 48 hours of hard work and crushing anxiety. Statements like this suggest as a writer you aren’t allowed free time, that weekends are for locking yourself away from your loved ones and sweating words. Which, sometimes, they are, especially if you’ve got a deadline approaching. But weekends, and evenings, and bank holidays… they should be for recharging and relaxing as well.\u0026nbspAgain, it’s more to do with the person making the statement than any real advice for would-be writers. It’s the Hemingway thing again. Get up at 5am. Write a thousand words. Have three mojitos for breakfast. Go and wrestle a shark. Make violent love to a woman. Smoke a cigar. Skip lunch. Write another thousand words. Be a real goddam writer! Sleep when your dead!Such “advice” is actually counter-productive to the new writer, and I suspect that’s kind of the point. Those setting out on the writing journey might look in awe at @RealGoddamWriter (if that’s actually a genuine account, I apologise in advance) and think, “Well, it’s good of them to share these vital rules for writing, but given that I have a day job and two kids and really, really, really want to watch Love Island tonight, I’m never going to be as good as this person so I’ll just go and weep into my Scrivener app.”Gaiman (Getty)Oh, here’s another piece of most-hated advice from my quick Twitter survey: write what you know. This can be a double-edged sword, because if you do know some good stuff, or have had a few life experiences, it’s not a bad idea to utilise it. Had kids? You’ll know what childbirth feels like. Lost a loved one? You can write bereavement from a position of knowledge. Done a bit of brain surgery? Well, what are you writing a novel for? There’s no money in it, you know.But if we all confined ourselves to writing what we have direct experience of, there’d be no science fiction or fantasy novels. I had a novel published last year about a man on his way to Mars. Come closer, I have a secret: I’m not an astronaut and have never been to space.It’s also a little curious that most writing advice on social media comes from authors who you might not necessarily class as bestsellers. Now, I’m not suggesting only those writers who make the top ten are worth a damn, but unsolicited rules and edicts usually come from authors who are not exactly household names.In fact, call me shallow, but when big-name authors do offer advice, I listen. One of my favourite books – and if you want to write anything yourself, you could do worse than check\u0026nbspit out – is On Writing by Stephen King. It’s partly a memoir, and partly an exploration of his own writing process.\u0026nbspIt’s hugely interesting and inspirational, but it’s also a book that is there only if you seek it out. King\u0026nbsp(and I could be wrong here, but I don’t think I am) rarely takes to Twitter to tell other people how to write. Indeed, in his second foreword in the book he writes: “This is a short book because most books about writing are filled with bullshit. Fiction writers, present company included, don’t understand very much about what they do – not why it works when it’s good, not why it doesn’t when it’s bad. I figured the shorter the book, the less the bullshit.”I’m also fond of what Neil Gaiman said in his 2012 keynote speech to the University of the Arts, which was basically that the best thing to do is ignore advice and plough your own furrow, because then\u0026nbspyou don’t know what you’re doing is considered wrong: “People who know what they are doing know the rules, and know what is possible and impossible. You do not. And you should not. The rules on what is possible and impossible in the arts were made by people who had not tested the bounds of the possible by going beyond them.”Of course, big-name writers have also been prescriptive. Raymond Chandler wrote his Ten Commandments for writing a detective novel. But then, Chandler was a genius, and he put together his rules (sample: it must be honest with the reader) seven or eight decades ago, and didn’t clog up my Twitter feed with them.Even Hemingway, our tough guy of American letters, offered writing guidance here and there. Strangely, very little of it was to do with wrestling bears or typing while running away from bulls. In fact, one of this best nuggets, which is from his memoir A Moveable Feast, is actually advice to himself on getting over writer’s block: “Do not worry. You have always written before and you will write now. All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.”BBC presenter with terminal cancer writes touching memoir for sonThe greetings you should avoid when writing an emailLove Island’s Niall Aslam is writing a book about Aspergers syndromeWhen I asked people on Twitter for their most hated writing advice, I also asked for the most useful. Practically everyone said the same thing, and I offer it to you now. You may, of course, ignore it completely, but all I can say is, I think you’d be wise not to.The advice is this: if you want to write, then read. Read novels in the area that you’re writing. Read novels in the area that you’re not writing. Read non-fiction. Read the news. Read the back of a Coco-Pops box. Learn how sentences are put together, how stories work, how novels are structured. Learn how Coco-Pops are made, because you never know when you’ll need that information.You wouldn’t expect to play for England without ever watching a football match, no matter how good you think you are hoofing a battered old leather ball around the park on your own. It’s the same with writing. See how others do it, then work out how you’re going to do it yourself. And never let anyone tell you that you’re doing it wrong, or that you should be doing it their way.So, what are you waiting for? Go write a book. But first, maybe go read one.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/09/16/perseids.jpg","title":"perseids meteor shower when where explained how to see date time","story":"Created with Sketch.View should be visible across the worldClick to followThe Independent OnlineThe Perseid meteor shower, one of the high points in the celestial calendar, occurs each year as the Earth ploughs through dusty debris left by Comet Swift-TuttleThe Perseid\u0026nbspmeteor shower is to pass over the UK and the rest of the world, lighting up the sky with a stunning celestial sight.And the display could be even brighter than ever, since a new moon will mean that the shooting stars have a clear stage for the world to see them.The Perseid meteor shower, one of the high points in the celestial calendar, occurs each year as the Earth ploughs through dusty debris left by Comet Swift-Tuttle.Perseids meteor shower around the worldHundreds of astronomy lovers enjoy the meteor shower in the aboriginal town of Atalayita in Canary IslandsA multiple exposure picture shows a Perseids meteor shower in the sky, near the municipality of La Hiruela, on the mountains of the Sierra Norte de MadridA shot of the Perseid meteor shower in 2008Shooting star illuminates the night sky near SieversdorfA streak appears in the sky during the annual Perseid meteor shower above a roadside silhouette of a Spanish fighting bull, conceived decades ago in Spain as highway billboards, in Villarejo de SalvanesA shooting star of the Perseids meteor shower burns up in the atmosphere in this photo taken near Salgotarjan, some 100km northeast of BudapestIn this photo taken with long shutter speed, a meteor sparks, lower right, while entering the earth\u0027s atmosphere behind an olive tree during the Perseids Meteor Shower, in Fanos villageStars and meteors are seen in a wide angle picture of the sky over MadridA multiple exposure picture shows a Perseids meteor shower in the sky, near the municipality of La Hiruela, on the mountains of the Sierra Norte de MadridHundreds of astronomy lovers enjoy the meteor shower in the aboriginal town of Atalayita in Canary IslandsA multiple exposure picture shows a Perseids meteor shower in the sky, near the municipality of La Hiruela, on the mountains of the Sierra Norte de MadridA shot of the Perseid meteor shower in 2008Shooting star illuminates the night sky near SieversdorfA streak appears in the sky during the annual Perseid meteor shower above a roadside silhouette of a Spanish fighting bull, conceived decades ago in Spain as highway billboards, in Villarejo de SalvanesA shooting star of the Perseids meteor shower burns up in the atmosphere in this photo taken near Salgotarjan, some 100km northeast of BudapestIn this photo taken with long shutter speed, a meteor sparks, lower right, while entering the earth\u0027s atmosphere behind an olive tree during the Perseids Meteor Shower, in Fanos villageStars and meteors are seen in a wide angle picture of the sky over MadridA multiple exposure picture shows a Perseids meteor shower in the sky, near the municipality of La Hiruela, on the mountains of the Sierra Norte de MadridAs the particles, ranging in size from a grain of sand to a pea, hit the Earth\u0027s atmosphere at 60km (37 miles) per second, they burn up and streak across the sky.Once darkness falls on August 12, sky-watchers can expect to see one of the shooting stars every few minutes.The Perseids reach their peak in the early hours of August 13 when up to 70 per hour should be visible.Dr Robert Massey, from the Royal Astronomical Society, said: The shower will be visible all over the UK, as long as the skies are clear.Unlike a lot of celestial events, meteor showers are easy to watch and no special equipment is needed, although a reclining chair and a blanket make viewing much more comfortable.To make the best of the meteors, observers should avoid built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.The shooting stars will appear to come from a single point, or radiant, situated in the constellation Perseus, that climbs higher as the night progresses.Greater numbers of meteors are visible when the radiant is high. But the most spectacular long-lasting meteors, known as Earthgrazers, can be seen when the radiant is still low above the horizon.Lucky observers may see the occasional meteor sailing across the sky for several seconds, leaving behind a trail of glowing smoke.Additional reporting by agenciesEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/13/01/jim-ratcliffe.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/13/01/jim-ratcliffe.jpg","title":"brexit new poll public final say no deal scenario","story":"Created with Sketch.Just one in four trust parliament with the decision as ‘no deal’ looms according to 10,000 strong poll sampleClick to followIndy PoliticsBrexit: Half of Britons want final say in no-deal scenario, major new poll findsHalf of Britons want a referendum on leaving the European Union if Brexit talks collapse and the country faces leaving with no deal, a major new poll has revealed.The huge study carried out by YouGov, which surveyed a weighted sample of more than 10,000 people, found just a quarter want parliament to be given the final decision.The key finding comes as concern over a no-deal Brexit increases, precipitating a slump in sterling\u0026nbspamid news that the UK government is stockpiling food and medicine.The findings are\u0026nbspalso a major boost to the People’s Vote campaign for a new referendum, which commissioned the poll, and The Independent’s own Final Say campaign – which has attracted more than half a million signatories to its petition.The survey also shines a light on views of Brexit’s progress, with large majorities thinking talks are going poorly, that the process of leaving has been a mess, that the country would end up with a bad deal and that the British government would bear responsibility.Former president of YouGov Peter Kellner said: “If the Brexit negotiations with Brussels break down, a two to one majority of voters want the public, not parliament, to decide what happens.“Even people who voted Leave tend to prefer a new referendum, by 39-34 per cent. This is politically significant.Rees-Mogg suggests a second Brexit referendum would be acceptable in clip from 2011“There is clearly the potential for a broadly based campaign this autumn for a people’s vote\u0026nbspshould the Brussels talks go badly. Support for a new referendum would go well beyond the ranks of those who want to stop Brexit.”The pollsters asked “should the final decision be made by MPs voting in parliament or the public voting in a new referendum”, if the UK had to choose whether to remain in the EU or leave with no deal.It is now clear that the people are starting to find their voice and they demand a vote on the final Brexit deal as the only way out of this messHalf, 50 per cent, said the decision should be given to the public voting in a new referendum. Just 25 per cent said parliament should decide and 25 per cent said they did not know.Asked whether people agreed with the statement that “the negotiations are going badly at the moment”, a huge 74 per cent agreed to some extent, with just nine per cent disagreeing and 17 per cent saying they did not know.An even larger 83 per cent agreed with the statement that the “process of leaving the EU so far has been a mess”, with just six per cent disagreeing and ten per cent saying they did not know.Labour MP Chuka Umunna, a leading supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “Whether people voted leave or remain two years ago, nobody voted for this chaotic Brexit that will damage our living standards and public services, and which is being thrust on the country by politicians in Westminster.“It is now clear that the people are starting to find their voice, and they demand a vote on the final Brexit deal as the only way out of this mess.”Some 68 per cent agreed that “problems in the negotiations with the EU make it likely that Britain will get a bad deal”, with 13 per cent disagreeing and 19 per cent saying they did not know.In an ominous sign for the prime minister, 64 per cent agreed with the statement “if we get a bad deal, it will mainly be the UK government’s fault”, with 23 per cent disagreeing and 14 per cent saying they did not know.In the case that negotiations are completed, 45 per cent backed a new referendum on the deal, while 34 per cent opposed it\u0026nbspand 22 per cent said they did not know.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

In Asia, however, the species carries a virus that has been known to have a fatality rate of up to\u0026nbsp30\u0026nbspper cent.Woman suffers facial paralysis after being bitten by tick in gardenViral photo of ticks on muffin terrifies the internetTravellers to the US face threat from mosquito-borne diseasesRetired woman ticks off bucket list goal after man asks her on dateThough the invasive species has already spread to the densely populated New York suburbs, at the moment the greatest threat remains to livestock pets, and wild animals.The ticks can attack en masse and drain animals of blood so quickly they die – a cause of death known as exsanguination.Initially\u0026nbsphard to see with the naked eye, following a blood meal\u0026nbspthe ticks swell up to about the size of a baked bean, and females can then lay hundreds of eggs.Populations of the ticks can explode rapidly as the species is able to reproduce asexually – giving rise to an army of ravenous clones.“One tick can crank out females in fairly large numbers,” Thomas Yuill, a retired pathobiologist at the University of Wisconsin, told the New York Times.Tadhgh Rainey, an entomologist at the public health department of Hunterdon County\u0026nbspin New Jersey, was first to report the discovery of large numbers of the tick, in a paper published in May this year.“All life stages were found on the sheep, which had no history of travel outside the country,” he said.\u0026nbspIn a subsequent interview he said the owner came to his department with ticks on her hands and wrists.\u0026nbsp“I thought she’d have a few,” Mr\u0026nbspRainey said. “But she was covered in them, easily over 1,000 on her pants alone.”New Jersey wildlife officials are calling for anyone who spots the bloodsucking arachnid to contact them immediately.“This tick is a known pest in deer and has a wide host range, thus can infect a range of wildlife species,” said department officials, who described the pest as “exotic”.The diseases the ticks have been known to spread include Rickettsia japonica, the bacteria which causes oriental spotted fever, and Theileria orientalis, a parasite that causes cattle theileriosis – in which cattle suffer fever and sometimes breathing difficulties and weight loss.Studies have also indicated that some populations of the tick in China may harbour a virus that causes SFTS – severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome.The disease, first identified in 2009, causes fever, vomiting, hemorrhaging, and organ failure, and initially had a fatality rate of 30 per cent, though that has fallen significantly since its identification.World news in picturesA Palestinian girl smiles as she waits to receive aids at a United Nations food distribution centre in Jabalia refugee camp in the northern GazaAn Israeli soldier rides an armoured vehicle during an army drill after the visit of Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, IsraelUsable items are salvaged from a home destroyed in an earthquake in North Lombok, Indonesia.

said:\u0026nbsp”We thank the Colombian government for this decision and we are sure that it will contribute significantly to generating the necessary conditions in the search for peace in the Middle East.”Netanyahu arrives at Downing StreetPalestine has been recognised as a sovereign state by the UN General Assembly, the International Criminal Court and at least 136 other countries.It seeks to create a state in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem – lands Israel captured in the 1967 war.Colombia is the last country in South America to recognise Palestinian statehood.In December, it abstained from a vote by the 193-member UN General Assembly on a resolution calling for the US to drop its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. The US president, Donald Trump, had threatened to cut off financial aid to countries which voted in favour.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/09/14/west-bank-crocodiles.jpg","title":"israel west ban crocodile farm west bank settlement jordan valley gadi biton","story":"Created with Sketch.Locals worry some of the creatures may escape, for a third timeClick to followThe Independent OnlineCrocodiles lie in water at a farm in the Jordan Valley, West BankHundreds of crocodiles\u0026nbsphave been left\u0026nbspstranded in a remote part of Israel after a businessman bit off more than he could chew with plans for a farm in the\u0026nbspWest Bank.The predatory reptiles are stuck in a remote spot of the Jordan Valley leaving locals worried about what would happen if they escaped.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe creatures were initially\u0026nbspbrought to the settlement of Petzael\u0026nbspin the\u0026nbspmid-1990s\u0026nbspwhere it was hoped they would become a tourist attraction.\u0026nbspEnsuing Israeli-Palestinian violence kept visitors away and the crocodiles were later bought by entrepreneur Gadi Biton, who hoped to sell them for their skin.But in 2012\u0026nbspIsrael\u0026nbsppassed a law making\u0026nbspthe crocodile a protected animal, banning their sale as meat or merchandise, thereby making his plans untenable.\u0026nbspMr Biton\u0026nbsphas made multiple attempts to sell the animals abroad, but has so far failed.So they continue to laze next to a lagoon in their remote homeland, fed dead chickens\u0026nbsponce every eight days by a lone worker.\u0026nbsp“We found ourselves with hundreds of crocodiles in this farm that no one knows what to do with,” said David Elhayani, head of the Jordan Valley Regional Council.On two occasions, dozens of crocodiles have escaped. In one instance\u0026nbsp70\u0026nbspbroke free and were only recaptured after a\u0026nbspthree-day hunt.The crocodiles, which can live well into their 70s, are also reproducing. Female crocodiles lay 60 eggs at a time, although only a few survive in the wild. It is nonetheless thought that the numbers in Israel could\u0026nbspgrow to thousands in\u0026nbspcoming years.World news in picturesA Palestinian girl smiles as she waits to receive aids at a United Nations food distribution centre in Jabalia refugee camp in the northern GazaAn Israeli soldier rides an armoured vehicle during an army drill after the visit of Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, IsraelUsable items are salvaged from a home destroyed in an earthquake in North Lombok, Indonesia.

Heres what we know.The seven-time world champion was placed in a medically-induced coma following a skiing accident in 2013.Schumacher hit his head on a rock while skiing in the exclusive French Alps resort of Mirabel, suffering a traumatic brain injury.The sporting icon reportedly receives £115k-a-week care at a special medical facility at his Lake Geneva home, costs which are now expected to have exceeded £20m.Exact details about Schumacher’s condition have not been made public.A brain injury specialist named Dr Mark Meeks is claimed to be a new hope for the driving legend.Early in the New Year Professor Mark Obermann, Director of the Centre for Neurology at the Asklepios clinic said fans of the F1 great shouldn’t (give up hope).While Lewis Hamilton added his support, writing on Twitter: Praying for you and your family all the time #KeepFightingMichael #Legend.Formula One legend Michael Schumacher’s son Mick has shared memories of his dad after snapping up his first victory.The 19-year-old Prema Theodore Racing driver claimed his first ever win in European Formula 3 at Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium – his dad’s favourite track.Speaking about his victory with Mobil 1 The Grid three weeks ago, the young racer said the track brought him many happy memories as it was often labelled “the living room of my dad”.Seven-time world champion Michael is the most successful F1 driver ever - a record that remains untouched since his retirement in 2012.The most decorated Formula One driver in history, Michael holds the records for the most career wins, the most wins in a season, the most career pole positions, the most consecutive world championships, the most consecutive race wins and many, many more accolades.Alongside a number of high paid endorsements meant Michael was once among the highest paid athletes in the world.Latest figures suggest his net worth stands at just under £600 million ($780 million).Michael married Corinna in August 1995 in Germany.A keen horsewoman, Corinna won the European Championship in western style horse riding in 2010 and she is also an avid dog lover and animal rights activist.The pair have two children together.Gina-Maria was born in 1997 and is now a micro-cart driver and their formula racing son Mick, who was born in 1999.Sabine has said: What can be said is that the family really appreciates the empathy of the fans.The people really do see and understand (his health situation) is not to be shared in the public eye."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-9.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"720\" width=\"960","title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"So if youre after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further.Sign up to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun 10 - Receive the 10 biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-life stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TV\u0026ampShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.

Only whites qualify.For decades, the likes of Harriet Harman have led the crusade for equality, attacking men as oppressors and demanding — rightly — that women must be protected from abuse.Harman famously refuses even to endorse marriage as the best foundation for raising a family, let alone as a good thing in itself, a public commitment.Yet she and the overwhelming majority of virtue- signalling Labour MPs are silent, for instance, on the treatment of some Muslim women by some Muslim men.I can’t recall a Labour street protest against forced ­marriage or honour killings even though they are commonplace here and reprehensible in any society. Even the Home Office feels cowed when dealing with victims.Indeed, Labour turned on its own brave MP Sarah Champion for daring to raise the issue of rampant sex-trafficking by “mainly Pakistani men”.On the Left, racism trumps rape. Now, like the “F-word”, it has become the reach-for term of abuse applied to any debate — including the issue of Britain leaving the European Union.Opposition to the EU’s ­corrupt and undemocratic “Grand Projet” long precedes the uncontrolled mass immigration unleashed by Labour.Illegal immigration is simply another symptom of EU “we know best” arrogance — personified by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Yet preposterous Tory MP Anna “Suck-It-Up” Soubry routinely slurs 17.4million referendum voters as “racist”.It is the mantra of all those who see Brexit voters — more than half the country — as thick and nasty.Odious Peter Mandelson joined in last week, avoiding the “R-word” but ludicrously accusing anyone who wants to leave the EU of “hating foreigners”, which is the same thing.“Nationalism is a hatred of foreigners,” says the slippery Euro peer. “They should not be confused with patriots.”“I voted Remain in the referendum though I entirely respect the contrary view of many others.”Mandy’s relationship with the truth has always been flaky, but this is pure cant.Even those who once worked alongside Lord Mandelson when Labour still stood for something are appalled.Ex-Home Secretary and fellow Remainer David Blunkett snapped yesterday: “The allegation that some of those voting for Leave were ‘racist’ is not a new one.“It has been bandied about and seems to me not only an insult to the many people that I used to represent who voted Leave, but also to utterly miss the point of why the majority of British people voted the way they did.“If we fail to understand, then we do ourselves, but crucially also our democracy, a great disservice.”Lord Blunkett also slammed Mandy’s call for a second referendum.He is right. It is now clear the mood has hardened against bullying Brussels.The EU’s own snide insinuations that voters here are racist “Little Englanders” has not helped.Bank of England boss Mark Carney, architect of Project Fear, sank the Pound last week by claiming chances of a clean-break Brexit were “uncomfortably high”.Trade Secretary Liam Fox warns the odds are now 60-40 against a deal.Remainers should understand that every gratuitous insult to the intelligence of decent British voters is another nail in Theresa May’s chances of a friendly ­negotiated settlement.McDonnell, cleverer than Corbyn, wants to stop Labour being dragged into what deputy leader Tom Watson calls a “vortex of eternal shame”. But McDonnell, too, is stained by anti-Jewish sentiment.In any case, Britain needs Jeremy Corbyn – to remain in place as the sullen figurehead of a blinkered Marxist rabble and remind voters what they are risking at the next election.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Those being treated for an attempted overdose rose more than ten-fold — from 249 in 1997 to 2,736.As far as I am concerned, social media is almost entirely responsible.In a world where everyone relies on their phones for everything, there has never been a more worrying time for mental health.To be a teenage girl in this day and age is to be never alone — and always lonely.They are spending day after day wading through airbrushed photos of images society has deemed perfect.Whether it is a member of the Kardashian family posing with a diet pill, a boob job advert in the middle of Love Island or a photo of a friend with whitened teeth and smooth skin, our screens are filled with how we can be better — with how we SHOULD be better.Jon Goldin is vice chairman of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists.He  said recently: “There are a range of factors putting pressure on young children — academic pressure, exam pressure, social media . . . with fear of missing out and comparing yourself unfavourably to images you see online.“If you look at social media, my hunch is that girls are probably more sensitive to some of those factors than boys.”Although suicide is still the biggest killer of men under 45, awareness of this is at an all-time high. Hospital admissions for self-harm in boys, while still too high (2,236 last year), are stable.There was a campaign (which I took part in) two weeks ago that went viral on Instagram as people were asked to signal that they were OK as a means of opening a conversation on mental health.It is a conversation that desperately needs to be had.Despite massive steps to raise awareness, not least the Royal Family getting behind the Heads Together campaign for last year’s London Marathon, the internet — and young girls’ place in it — still needs a lot of talking about.I was lucky. Instagram was only invented when I was 16 and it did not matter a jot that I did not start using it until I was 18. Although we had social media, it was in its infancy, and I am incredibly grateful for that. My phone played a very small part in my life as a teenager.24% of girls are depressed by age 1480,000 UK kids suffer from severe depression90% of teen girls unhappy with their bodies70% of young people have been cyber-bulliedAs I went through the trials of being a young, insecure girl at school, negative thoughts were not able to follow me home. I would say goodbye to the bitching at 3.30pm and eat bangers and mash with my siblings without a thought for the girls in my class — no pinging from my phone to create waves of anxiety.These days that is simply not an option.Every issue that every teenager has ever faced is magnified to an extraordinary level with the advancement of technology.But removing phones from our daughters is simply not an option. Telling a teenager they can not have the internet is to tell them they can not have friends.Ten years ago a teenage friendship could withstand a summer holiday of no contact, but now a weekend with no signal, a Tuesday night with no Instagram story, makes kids hyperventilate.To be offline is to be forgotten. It is not showing up to the only party. The party that is going on all day and, more worryingly, all night too.Self-harm is, more often than not, a cry for help.As the internet forces its way into every corner of our lives, I cannot help but feel that it is a cry for human attention for affectionate, real-life attention.Warning signs  include if a child starts talking about themself in terms of failure or if there is a  change in their eating or sleeping patterns.Try asking  open-ended questions and do not give up if they are reluctant to  respond.Do not ban social media but set a good example and do activities away from it together.If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this article, please call the Samaritans (free) on 116 123.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The PM has — finally — started to talk to them with a concrete plan.The silence after her meeting with Emmanuel Macron is concerning, but the noises from German business leaders and politicians from the Continent in recent weeks are more promising.As the clock ticks, it’s time for them to tell Brussels that the theatrics and the anti-Britain briefings have to end. The Chequers fudge is not perfect. But Brussels would be mad to knock it back.And if they do? Planning is already stepping up for a clean-break Brexit.The PM still believes no deal is better than a bad deal and insists she’s ready to walk away.And that, as President Trump knows, is The Art Of The Deal…AND so another new front opens up in the war against the motorist.It’s outrageous that companies in some parts of the country could be charged if their employees drive to work.Those firms, who have already paid business rates for having a car park, will just pass on the extra cost to workers. Another stealth tax, another pocket emptied.We wouldn’t mind so much if we believed the money would be ploughed back into the roads, getting rid of potholes and fixing rocky road surfaces. Or if the trains turned up when they’re supposed to.But we won’t hold our breath.POLICE unions never fail to complain about overwork and stress on the job.We can understand why. It’s not an easy job. Coppers have our respect.But the news that one in 12 have second jobs suggests that not all of the wailing about long hours and working conditions are entirely legitimate.The next time a victim is told there’s nobody available to investigate, they might wonder what their local bobbies are up to.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I wasn’t surprised I choked on my toast because anything bad that happens to me — big or small — I’ve already lived through in my imagination.But I choked at the sheer obviousness of the scientists’ conclusions. Of course feeling stressed helps people deal with bad news. What next? Scientists discover sleep is related to tiredness?I can deal with bad news better because I’ve already been in that moment. I’m well prepared because I’ve actually lived it in my head.Anyway, the choking passed and, to my surprise, I didn’t die. That’s another beauty of always believing the worst will happen. What a wonderful surprise it is when the worst doesn’t happen.The toast didn’t kill me. I cheated the choke. Oh, the joy.I don’t know how long I’ve been this way. It’s definitely been going on since I was a kid.I remember flying off on holiday to what was then Yugoslavia with my mum and dad. I recall my mum trying to talk to me about all the exciting things we’d be doing when we got to my nan’s house on the Adriatic.I kept shaking my head and not saying anything and she got annoyed and rolled her eyes, thinking I just wasn’t looking forward to our holiday.But she misunderstood me. I didn’t want to think about the nice things we’d be doing because I was so convinced the plane was going to crash that it made me sad to consider what I surely wouldn’t experience.Imagine, then, my joy when the plane didn’t actually crash and I ended up not dying. What a bonus!And I went in the sea and didn’t drown — another nice surprise.I almost look forward to the moment when I do croak. If I have any warning I’ll tut and say to myself, “Oh well, I knew this would happen sooner or later.”This kind of attitude is admittedly a disaster when it comes to wooing women. Assuming total failure ahead of any move made on the opposite sex is disastrous. It’s just not attractive.I’ve a friend who simply cannot imagine why any woman in the world wouldn’t desire him.Consequently, many women do desire him. I, on the other hand, simply cannot imagine why any woman would desire me. Consequently, they invariably don’t. But because I knew they wouldn’t, I’m not remotely downhearted.I’ve kept the company of positive people over the years. They have their uses. But expecting me to believe them when they say, “Don’t worry, it’ll all be fine”, is fanciful.And believing that from professional advisers can be absolutely calamitous.“Oh yes, Adrian, it’s all going to be fine.” And then, whatever it is, turns out not to be fine and they just shrug and say, “Oh dear, didn’t see that coming, pay me some more fees and I’ll make sure it’ll be all right in the end.”In my work as a journalist I’ve talked to many psychologists who speak of the power of positive thinking. Yeah, whatever. Maybe. But what I do know for sure is that I just can’t do it.When you’re standing on a golf course with a club in your hand addressing the ball, you’re supposed to envisage your perfect shot. For me, impossible.What I actually envisage, with complete clarity, is a truly dreadful shot.I can actually hear the ball smacking on to trees, or plopping into water. I’m living in the calamity.So at least when it happens, which is often, I can shrug and say, “Hmm, thought so.”All this may stem from supporting a team like West Bromwich Albion. I once told a priest, in all seriousness, that I suffered from deep despondence.When he asked me why I thought this was, I told him (as a joke) who I supported. He nodded gravely and said, “Yes, I see, I see.”I have a friend I travel with on the supporters’ coaches to away matches. The poor chap always thinks we’re going to win. Even at 2-0 down at half-time he’ll be sure we’ll emerge victorious.I challenged him once about these absurd delusions and he said: “Look, we all have the same journey home after a game. If we’ve won we’re both happy, if we lose we’re both sad. The difference is that I’ve had a much more enjoyable journey there than you.”That convinced me for a while. So the next game I tried being positive.And we lost. And it hurt more. So I went back to how I was.There’s only one route to happiness I can think of and it’s to be found in the lyrics of a song by the late Mose Allison: “I don’t worry ’bout a thing, ’cos I know nothing’s going to be alright.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in those days — the late Seventies — it was rare and unrecognised.We lost touch a long time ago, but I thought of Sarah this week when I read that the number of teenage girls self-harming has doubled in the past 20 years.According to new NHS data, the number of hospital admissions for girls who have self-harmed has jumped from 7,327 in 1997 to 13,463 last year. For boys, the figures have stayed almost the same — from 2,236 then to 2,332 now.Worse, “self-poisoning” — as in taking an overdose — is rising for both genders and last month the Government released a green paper that said around 850,000 children and young people now have a diagnosable mental health condition.Experts say academic pressure is a contributory factor, so too social media.Kids have always had exams to cope with but in the old days jealous and bitter remarks were confined to the dark corners of secret conversations or, at worst, scrawled on a toilet wall.Now these brave warriors have a keyboard and pseudonym behind which they can troll you for everyone to see.By my age, you know the vitriol probably comes from a bitter, 53-year-old virgin who lives in his mother’s spare bedroom. But when you’re still finding your way in the world, that poisonous undermining can worm its way inside your head and chip away at the confidence that acts as an armour in life.One self-harmer told me the pain of cutting his skin provided a welcome distraction from the “washing machine” rotations of negative thoughts constantly disturbing his peace of mind.The majority of them can be helped if it is spotted early enough and the expert assistance they need is then easy to access. And therein lies the problem.In 2016, Theresa May said the mental health of children was to be one of her priorities as PM, but since then Brexit has taken over and little has changed.The Government’s strategy is to train more teachers to spot the signs, appoint 7,000 more specialists to child mental health units and cut the waiting time for non-critical cases to be seen.But even if it happens, it won’t be enough.Parents must also remain vigilant for any marked change in their child’s personality or behaviour and the big social media companies have the technology to stop the majority of trolls — so they should be forced to use it.If all of the above doesn’t happen, the NHS has another mental health time bomb coming which will cost the taxpayer a fortune and have an even greater cost to the mental well-being of the next generation.WHEN TV baker Paul Hollywood started dating a 23-year-old barmaid from his local pub, they were quick to point out that their relationship only started after his marriage to wife Alex ended.But Alex is reportedly not buying this explanation and is planning to name Summer Monteys-Fullam in her £10million divorce battle.Whatever the truth, it remains the case that many couples conveniently consider only full sexual intercourse as adultery.But of course, cosy chats, lingering touches and come-hither looks are all it takes for any man with a wandering eye to recognise that, should he wish to jump ship, there’s a shiny new model waiting in the wings to rev up his sex life.Hallelujah for the wonderfully pragmatic Emma Thompson who, when asked about her marriage to the dreamily handsome Greg Wise, replied that they have had plenty of rough times.The secret to a happy relationship, she says, is the realisation that there will be unhappy times and that, if you manage to amble through to the other side: “It’s always better.”She adds: “I think people in long, happy marriages tell a lot of fibs, like, ‘Yes, it’s been marvellous’, whereas I say, ‘Sometimes it has been awful’.”If a relationship is deeply unhappy for a sustained period then, of course, get the hell out.But in these Tinder times of endlessly sweeping left in search of the “perfect” mate (who doesn’t exist) it’s invaluable when someone high profile points out that, more often than not, sticking with the one you’ve got works out in the end.Altogether now, “Love is a decision, not just a feeling.”Daisy-May Demetres smile lights up a room.Just eight years old, she was born without her lower legs and now uses two prosthetic blades that allow her to live as full a life as possible.She attends mainstream school, loves PE and has just been given a modelling contract with high street brand River Island.Yet, because of her disability, her parents Alex and Claire admit to feeling a “profound sadness” the day she was born and asked themselves what they had done wrong. And when, as a toddler, Daisy-May had to endure a painful, eight-hour operation on her stumps, Alex admits he turned to alcohol and gambling in a bid to numb his feelings of hopelessness.But by the time she was four, Daisy-May had mastered her blades and was doing cartwheels and headstands.Alex, 35, from Birmingham, says: “I looked at her and thought, ‘If you can achieve so much, against all the odds, and still be cheerful, then I have no reason at all to be depressed’. I stopped gambling and drinking that day.”While no one would wish disability on their child, the Demetres’ story is a salutary lesson that, sometimes, what seems like insurmountable adversity through an adult’s eyes can, through a child’s simple acceptance and joie de vivre, enrich your life and give it deeper meaning.Following a cyber attack in Alaska, government officials have abandoned their computers and taken to using old-fashioned typewriters.Let joy be unconfined.I still have my original typewriter from my days as a junior reporter on the Solihull News and it was a loyal servant that never crashed, froze or ran out of battery. I may even request for it to be buried with me.It seems that my love for these machines is rivalled only by Tom Hanks (yes, that one) who has written a book of short stories about them and created an app called the Hanx Writer, which emulates the glorious click-clack sound as you type.Go on, try it. There’s no greater pleasure.No? Just me then...Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We’re losing more and more of our natural wildlife. Our open spaces diminish daily.And now the Government is being forced into building countless millions of homes. Why?We’re told we have a housing crisis. You might find this puzzling when you consider the birth rate in Britain has been dropping, not rising.The answer, of course, is immigration. We’ve been letting in half a million people every year for almost 15 years.The politicians try to tell you it’s nothing to do with our housing crisis — but they are lying. Lying to themselves and to you.One top academic expert, Oxford demographer David Coleman, reckons immigration is 85 per cent responsible for the rise in the UK’s population between 2000 and 2015.And the other figures you might find a bit chilling.Did you know, for example, that a whopping 28 per cent of all births in the UK are to foreign-born women? And the figure in London is a staggering 60 per cent.If you find an indigenous British person in London, say hello to him for me and wish him the best. He’s the last of a dying breed. White Brits are a minority in our capital.It’s not just that. The birth rate for British people is 1.75. The birth rate for immigrants is 2.06. That’s a very big difference.So not only do we let in half a million per year, but they have more kids and so doubly contribute to population growth and the need for new houses.Oh, and the need for lots of other very expensive stuff, such as schools, hospitals, welfare benefits and so on.We MUST call a halt to immigration. The overwhelming majority of the population thinks we need much tougher controls.And there are many people who think that immigration has not made the country any better, but actually made it worse.Cut the numbers coming in to 10,000 per year and our housing crisis would begin to lessen, given that 300,000 or so people emigrate every year.A net decrease in the population would massively reduce the need for new housing.Because unless we do that, the bulldozers will be moving in. The fields, hedges and woodland will be ripped up. The roads will be laid and the peace and quiet shattered.And this will not be a green and pleasant land for much longer.Katie Price has just managed to avoid being declared bankrupt.She’s been given three months to pay off a whole load of creditors, plus a whopping tax bill.Everyone seems shocked that she has apparently blown £45million.But that body needs a lot of upkeep.

We must have American dominance in space.The Pentagon and US Department of Defence have been tasked with creating the new force to ensure what Trump called American dominance of space.It will be the sixth branch of the US armed forces — alongside the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard.Trump said he wants to counter Russian and Chinese developments in space tech.And he said he wants US agencies to implement a state-of-the-art framework for space traffic management.Announcing the decision on June, 18 2018, Trump said: We are going to have the Air Force, but we are going to have the Space Force — separate but equal.The United States already has some space fighting infrastructure and much of its military set-up has input from space technology — from long-range missiles to satellite tracking.The Colorado-based Air Force Space Command in 1982 includes more than 36,000 personnel around the world that provide space and cyber capabilities for the Defense Department.The Space and Missile Systems Center at Los Angeles Air Force Base in California, designs, buys and oversees most of the Pentagons space systems.Trump said in the East Room of the White House: My administration is reclaiming Americas heritage as the worlds greatest spacefaring nation.The essence of the American character is to explore new horizons and to tame new frontiers.“Im hereby directing the Department of Defence and Pentagon to immediately begin the process necessary to establish a space force as the sixth branch of the armed forces.”At the time, Mr Trump said Space Force would be separate but equal to the Air Force.Mr Trump backed his Vice President after he had finished speaking with a message on Twitter that read: Space Force all the way!  Previously, Mr Mattis had disapproved of creating a sixth branch of the military.Mattis wrote in a letter to the House and Senate armed services committees: “I oppose the creation of a new military service and additional organisational layers at a time when we are focused on reducing overhead and integrating joint war-fighting efforts.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425758573.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"dambusters bounding bomb kent beach","story":"James Crouch, 36, was set to fish for crabs with four-year-old Freddie, when he noticed the test bomb in Reculver, near Minnis Bay.The prototype barrel-shaped Vickers type 464 bomb - codenamed Upkeep - is believed to have been dropped by RAF crews ahead of the 1943 bombing mission Operation Chastise.RAF serviceman Guy Gibson and his crews released the bombs in a bid to target the heart of Nazi Germany.Before they completed the immense task of blasting Adolf Hitlers dams in the Ruhr Valley, they conducted a series of test-runs across Britain, before May 16-17.While they honed their skills, Guy Gibson and his 617 crews dropped four-tonne bombs filled with concrete were dropped in the likes of Wales, the Lake District and Kent.James said: It was mechanical and had obviously been there a long time because there were barnacles on it. We looked at it and thought it could be a bomb.Its amazing. It is great to find such a piece of history when you are out looking for crabs. Its exciting.The Dambusters raid, also known as Operation Chastise, was one of the most difficult and famous missions of World War Two.Eight aircrafts were lost and 54 Commonwealth airmen were killed.Guy Gibson led 19 RAF Lancaster bombers of 617 Squadron into the heart of Nazi Germany on the night of May 16-17 1943.They dropped bombs on three dams in the Ruhr Valley, in a bid to cause havoc in Hitlers industrial centre.The team blasted the dams, leaving water to swarm the surrounding ocuntryside, and much of Hitlers armement factories.Guy, the brave Wing Commander, made the first attack on Mohne Dam, but his bomb exploded short. Two aircrafts were shot down, but the RAF serviceman continued to attack as German soldiers fired.He was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions.The Eder Dam was the next target, before the Sorpe Dam.The skilful nature of the mission was the inspiration for the 1955 film, The Dam Busters.They were dropped in top-secret test runs across Britain, including Wales, the Lake District and Kent.Only 11 of the 19 bombers that flew off to attack the Möhne, Edersee and Sorpe dams returned back to base.Dambusters expert Dr Hugh Hunt, a Reader in Engineering Dynamics \u0026amp Vibration at the University of Cambridge hailed the discovery as a piece of good British war history.Dr Hunt said: They did lots of testing around the county with these bombs filled with concrete because they could not use explosives.What has happened [to this bomb] is the steel has rusted away and you are left with the concrete.Some would have been recovered immediately after the tests they did as they did not want anybody to find out about the mission.In the years after the war it would have been hushed up. They did not do testing in places for very long because they did not want to spoil the surprise. They tested at night.This is quite an important find. I hope it goes somewhere useful.A similar prototype Dambusters bomb sits outside the Petwood Hotel in Lincolnshire, which was once home to the of the legendary RAF 617 “Dambusters” Squadron.A Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokesman said: HM Coastguard is currently investigating reports of ordnance found at Reculver, Herne Bay.At the moment the ordnance is covered by water but a Coastguard Rescue Team will be sent to investigate at the next low water, which is currently expected to be around 5pm today."},{"url":null,"title":"egypt ancient sphinx discovery valley of the kings","story":"The roadworks between the ancient temples of Karnak and Luxor have been halted after the large statue was discovered featuring a “lion’s body and a human head”.The relic could date as far back as 2500 BC and the reign of Pharoah Kafre.The Director General of Antiquities Mohamed Abel Aziz announced plans to excavate the statue, which is still buried in the ground and embedded in the soil.He added the process could take some time due to the age of the statue and the chances of damaging it after thousands of years.Mr Abel Aziz confirmed the new find had similarities to the “classical” Great Sphinx of Giza which stands 66ft tall in front of the Great Pyramids.A sphinx is a mythical creature usually depicted in Egypt as having a human head with the body of a lion.Egyptian sphinxes are usually depicted as male but Greek ones are often female.The Egyptian ones are seen as benevolent, but possessing incredible strength, and seen as s and can often be seen outside the entrance to temples.Many believe the head of the sphinx at Giza to be the pharaoh Khafra.The oldest known sphinx was found near Gobekli Tepe in Turkey and is believed to date to 9500 BC.In Greek mythology, the sphinx was said to ask all passers-by the riddle: Which creature has one voice and yet becomes four-footed and two-footed and three-footed?The sphinx then is meant to have devoured anyone who could not answer.Oedipus, according to legend, finally solved the riddle by replying: Man—who crawls on all fours as a baby, then walks on two feet as an adult, and then uses a walking stick in old ageKhaled al Anani, the national heritage chief, encouraged people to go and visit the site to see the new discovery.Local news website Youm reported that the statue could not yet be lifted above ground “due to the nature of the environment it is in.”The second sphinx was found just over six miles from the famous Valley of Kings – the burial place of the ancient Pharaohs.It was uncovered between two the temples on the opposite bank of the River Nile."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000301759643.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"womens refuges sun on sunday save our shelter campaign","story":"Ministers confirmed refuges can continue to claim housing benefit, which makes up half of their cash.Four in ten shelters faced closure amid plans to devolve funding to local authorities — taking them out of the welfare system.But the Ministry of Housing announced benefits will remain in place for all support housing.Housing Secretary James Brokenshire praised our sister paper’s three-year Save Our Shelters campaign.He said: “I commend The Sun on Sunday for its support of victims of domestic violence.

After the British people voted to leave the European Union we were told “Brexit means Brexit” and that critical “red lines” would guide our negotiations with the EU. So far, so good.Fast forward to today and we live in a different world. The so-called Chequers Agreement crosses all those red lines.We are dancing the hokey cokey with the Customs Union and Single Market, which means restricting our freedom for new free trade agreements.These, of course, are critical to the national economic success of Brexit. European regulations will remain in force — with no input from the UK. So we stay under the rule of European courts and provide a back door for continued freedom of movement for EU nationals into Britain.Our laws and courts will not be supreme as Chequers would leave us being run by remote control from Brussels.To frighten us into submission we are spoon-fed a daily diet of tales of food shortages, soldiers in the streets and tailbacks from Dover to Land’s End.But the political graveyards are full of people who underestimated the good sense of the British people, the very people who want to be in command of their own destiny and who don’t want to be taken advantage of by the EU.And don’t forget that despite Project Fear in the referendum, the majority still voted to Leave and the fear-mongering was proven false.So false that the fear of recession and job losses was met by a growing economy, UK manufacturing output growing at its fastest rate in a decade, exports to the US in 2016 exceeding £100billion — more than twice as much as exports to any other country — and the fact that our economy is worth more than £2trillion and is the sixth largest in the world.Project Fear was proven false and so will this latest version of fear, which speaks volumes about what the Government thinks of voters — sheep to frighten into the right pen. But sheep we are not.I’ve spent the past few weeks meeting party activists, businesses and the public, supporters of Leave and Remain from across the country and the view is that Chequers will give us neither our economic nor political freedom.Their concerns are simple. There can be no halfway house, where Britain continues to be out of Europe in name but is still run by Europe.There can be no halfway house when it comes to rule-taking and law-making from the EU, and there is an overwhelming sense of frustration that Britain is being taken advantage of by the EU.And across the heartlands of the UK this matters, as these people are the ones who have been left behind and who are desperate to take back control of our laws, our borders and our money. There will also be long-term consequences if the largest democratic vote in British history is frustrated.We will face a crisis of democracy in which ordinary people will utterly lose their faith and trust in politics and in politicians. The implications for political parties at the polls when they fail to deliver is clear, the public will stop voting for them. We cannot ignore the people.The Conservative Party could throw away hard-won gains in pro-Leave constituencies across the North East and Midlands if we continue to compromise on the referendum and concede ground to Brussels.Across Europe we have seen political parties and governments do exactly that and the result is a wave of terrifying extreme forms of nationalism and populism. That is not the British way because when our governments deliver, they deliver for our country and our people.The time has come for our political leaders to believe in Britain and in the British people. They should abandon the weak-kneed approach and instead play to our strengths. Britain wants to secure a trade deal with the EU and seeks to establish a “strong and special partnership” with them.Talk of no deal really means no trade deal, and if the EU fails to reach a free trade agreement with Britain, in the long term we can thrive under World Trade Organisation rules. The UK exports to 111 countries under WTO rules and over the past 23 years this grew at a rate which was three times faster than those exporting to the major EU nations.We also know that the European Commission, thanks to the many political problems across the European Union, desperately needs British taxpayers to foot the “exit payment” of £39billion to balance its budget.And 1.2million EU jobs depend on selling goods to Britain, with London providing much-needed financing to EU businesses. Brexit will not be easy.There is hard work to do but we are up to the task. We are a free and independent country and will prosper if given a proper chance.But to let the British lion roar again the first step is to chuck Chequers.The Prime Minister assures us freedom of movement will end and that we’ll be able to do trade deals. Others, including former Cabinet ministers such as Ms Patel, believe otherwise.It is time for the Prime Minister to sell the Chequers deal directly to the country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was protecting myself.“I would say, I took the decision of what I did very quickly.“As soon as this episode started I knew that myself or other people could be a target of these men.One had already told me what he would do. I felt under threat by these two.“He had ran at a close friend of mine with a bottle.As soon as I decided to get involved I felt that I was under threat and what I did was in defence of myself.”Stokes, nursing a bad back, switched between sitting and standing to give evidence.He told of his lager and vodka intake that night as he and England teammates celebrated a one-day win over the West Indies last September.Stokes was then asked what led to the fight, which left Mr Hale and Ali knocked unconscious and needing hospital treatment for facial injuries.The cricketer said he noticed Ali and Mr Hale and friends Mr O’Connor and Mr Barry shouting at each other in the street.Stokes told the jury: “Mr Hale and Mr Ali were shouting homophobic comments towards these two. I said you shouldn’t be taking the p*** because they are gay.“I was told by Mr Ali, along the lines of, ‘Shut the f*** up or I’ll bottle you,.”The court also heard from student Max Wilson who had filmed the incident on his phone from his digs overlooking pubs and clubs in the city’s Clifton Triangle.He said he passed the video to The Sun who in turn gave it to police.Mr Cole told Stokes: “We’re going to ask you about the Sun footage. Were you enraged?”Stokes replied: “I find it a difficult question to answer.”In bodycam footage following his arrest, Stokes was seen mouthing something to teammate Hales, 29.Asked what he was saying, Stokes told the court: “I was telling Hales, ‘Leave, get out of here, don’t get involved’.“I’m the one sat in a police car with cuffs on. It’s on me.”In his evidence Stokes denied earlier being homophobic to Mr O’Connor and Mr Barry outside Mbargo but claimed they were bantering about his bad dress sense.He said they were making comments about his clothes — including a pair of £695 white Buscemi hi-top trainers — shortly before the fight broke out.The star was again watched by wife Clare, 28 — mum to their two children — who has been sitting in the public gallery throughout the trial.He was previously accused by the nightclub bouncer of homophobia by mimicking the gay pair and flicking a cigarette butt at one.Asked by his barrister, Gordon Cole QC: “Were you mimicking them?”, the 6ft 2in all rounder replied: “No”.Mr Cole asked: “Was any of it homophobic?”Stokes replied: “No, definitely not.The only comments between myself and the gay couple was what we were wearing.I get told that quite a lot by my teammates that I dress the worst in the team.”Mr Cole asked: “Did you get angry about what was said?”Stokes replied: “No.”Mr Cole added: “Enraged?”Stokes said: “No.”Mr Cole held Stokes’ white designer trainers, which have a gold padlock on the heel, in the air for the jury to see.That prompted Judge Peter Blair to say: “They are Italian white leather I believe.”Asked if he remembered flicking a cigarette at the gay men, Stokes replied: “I don’t remember flicking a cigarette towards anyone as described.“It looks like I have done something in the direction in one of these gentlemen.”Mr Cole asked: “Do you remember throwing anything?” Stokes replied: “No.”The cricketer said he could not remember the first person he contacted after his arrest.He told the court: “I was stuck in a bit of a problem as I wasn’t sure who to contact.Being a cricketer I have a manager who looks after my stuff.”Stokes and Ali deny affray. The case continues.But Stokes denied offering that much money or saying anything about his teeth.He added: “I said to him ‘Come on mate I’ve got s*** tattoos as well’.“I’m constantly getting told from teammates that I play with that I’ve got s*** tattoos.”He also denied giving the doorman a V-sign.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’ve been shocked at what I’ve seen on social media.”It came as Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell was exposed for a 2012 speech where he described Israeli attacks on Gaza as attempted genocide.The Daily  also drew attention to his 2016 appearance on a platform alongside activist Jackie Walker, who was suspended by Labour for alleged anti-Semitism.Speaking to a Unite The Resistance event at a time of intensive Israeli air strikes on the Gaza enclave, Mr McDonnell said: “It’s absolutely critical now that we use every platform we can to expose what’s going on, which is effectively an attempt at genocide against the Palestinians.”Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, told the paper his remarks were “not only inaccurate, but irresponsible and deeply offensive”.But Mr McDonnell accused the newspaper of “doing a number” on him and made clear he stands by the remarks.In a statement his spokesman said he “takes pride in and stands by his track record of forcefully and justifiably condemning brutal attacks on the Palestinian men, women and children of Gaza and will always stand up for victims of such disproportionate violence”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Unless it is for medical reasons or if a parent and child have been split up I don’t understand why a whole row of us had to be moved for another passenger.“I spoke to one of the air hostesses and asked why we had been moved and she just pointed out that Coleen Rooney was on board and wanted all of her party to sit together.Marks partner Lynn Waterhouse, 52, managed to take a picture of Coleen, the wife of ex-England captain Wayne Rooney, sitting in the seats they had reserved for the three-hour flight.Mark had booked the seats in January for him, Lynn, son Joshua, 15, dad Tom, 75, Lynn’s sister Kathryn Pullar, 48, and her partner Richard Townend, 45.A spokesperson for Jet2 insisted Mark and his party were moved to the back row for safety and operational requirements.But the airline has only refunded him the £60 seat reservation fee.Coleen, 32, had been on a family holiday in the Algarve with her four children Kai, eight, Klay, five, Cass, four, and Kit, two.A source said that she was completely unaware of the incident.Mark added: “She should have hired her own plane if she wanted everyone to sit together.“I don’t know why she is more important than us.

Heres more about the killer disease and how it is treated.During the 20th century it was responsible for 300-400 million deaths and in 1967 the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated that around 15 million people had the disease and two million died in that year.Fortunately after various vaccination campaigns during the 19th and 20th centuries, smallpox was considered to be globally eradicated in 1979 by the WHO.But, now scientists are concerned the disease may be making a comeback because climate change is rapidly thawing the permafrost where the infected bodies are buried.During the 1890s, a major epidemic of smallpox broke out in a small Siberian town near the Kolyma River in Russia.The disease killed up to 40 per cent of the population and the bodies were buried in soil near the river, but now the water is thawing the banks three times faster than usual - the infected bodies are becoming exposed.If someone has contracted smallpox, the symptoms will usually appear between 12 and 14 days after exposure.After an incubation period of between a week to 17 days, victims will likely experience a sudden onset of flu-like symptoms, which could include:After these initial symptoms occur red legions will start to appear on your face, hands and forearms a few days later.And within a day or two, these will develop into small fluid-filled blisters which soon turn into pus.Over the next eight to nine days, these clear blisters will start to scab and leave pitted scars.If an outbreak of smallpox has occurred anyone who has come into contact with an infected person will be given a vaccination which can prevent or lessen the impact of the disease.But currently, there is no cure once a person has developed the deadly disease, although there are some prevention techniques to stop the symptoms becoming worse.Firstly, victims will be kept hydrated to prevent a break out of infection and antibiotics may be prescribed to stop bacteria developing in the lungs of the skin.The last person to die from smallpox was a woman named Janet Parker.The 40-year-old medical photographer from Birmingham died on September 11, 1978 - exactly one month after she started feeling unwell.Within days, she developed unsightly red spots on her back, limbs and face, but when a doctor was called, she was told she had chickenpox.However, she had already had the chickenpox virus as a child, and her sceptical mother knew the large blistering pustules now appearing on her body were considerably different.As her condition deteriorates, Janet was admitted to the Catherine-de-Barnes Isolation Hospital in Solihull.At the time, the WHO was on the brink of declaring smallpox eradicated worldwide, and there had been no reported cases of the disease in the UK for five years.By 28 August, just two weeks after the 40-year-old first shown symptoms of the disease, more than 500 people had been vaccinated as the country put into place emergency measures.It is believed she contracted the virus while working in the smallbox laboratory at Birmingham Medical School - headed by Professor Henry Bedson.He took responsibility for her condition, and feeling distraught he committed suicide. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Egyptian floated the business on the stock market again nine years later, minus Harrods, which had been its most valuable asset.By the late 1990s, struggling to compete with the new out-of-town shopping outlets that had lured shoppers away from the traditional high street locations from which it traded, House of Fraser was labouring under heavy debts.The solution of John Coleman, its chief executive at the time, was to strike a deal in July 1999 that saw the freeholds of 15 of the group\u0027s stores sold and then leased back.Unfortunately, a store freehold can only be sold once and the sale-and-leaseback agreement tied House of Fraser into some onerous rental agreements, some of which went out 40 years.In the meantime, the group continued to be a consolidator in the sector, snapping up rivals such as Beatties, the Midlands department store operator and Jenners, based in Edinburgh.One, like Jenners and Dickins \u0026 Jones, have retained their names but, along the way, other famous old brands owned by House of Fraser have been replaced with the latter brand.The last Army \u0026 Navy stores, for example, were rechristened House of Fraser in 2005 stores previously trading under the name Binns, largely in the North East of England, were nearly all rebranded by 2006 and DH Evans was rebranded as long ago as 2001. These rebrandings in many cases severed a link between the stores and communities in which they had traded for many years and confused older shoppers.The next chapter came when, in 2006, House of Fraser was bought by the Icelandic group Baugur. The latter went bust three years later, in the wake of the financial crisis and the collapse of Iceland\u0027s economy, with Baugur\u0027s shares being scattered among a group of Icelandic banks.By then House of Fraser was in the middle of a turnaround under John King, the former Matalan boss, who had joined in early 2007 and Don McCarthy, an experienced retailer who became chairman under Baugur.But in 2013, the business changed hands again, being bought by the Chinese retailer Sanpower for a remarkable \u0026#163480m. Mr McCarthy left almost immediately and the talented Mr King, who had been promised the chairmanship by the new owners, left at the beginning of 2015 when that pledge went unfulfilled.The Chinese have proved to be as poor owners of House of Fraser as Mr Fayed was. Promised investment has never materialised, experienced managers have left the business and the group was left in no fit state to face either the hurricanes buffeting the high street or the intensification of competition as both John Lewis and Debenhams sought to respond to changing consumer tastes."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-ben-stokes-trial_4385716.jpg?20180810105504 ","title":"mike ashleys sports direct buys house of fraser for 90m","story":"The deal represents a stunning coup for Mr Ashley, who has harboured a long-standing desire to move his retail empire upmarket by acquiring one of Britain\u0027s leading department store chains.He has held an 11% stake in the business since 2014, and also owns close to 30% of Debenhams, its main rival.Under Mr Ashley\u0027s stewardship, Sports Direct has accumulated stakes - often through complex financial instruments - in a number of British high street chains, including Debenhams and French Connection.Sky News revealed last week that Mr Ashley was in talks about providing a rescue package to keep HoF afloat, although in recent days he had faced serious competition to buy the business from Philip Day, the billionaire behind Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group.Details of Mr Ashley\u0027s plans for HoF, including how many of the 17,500 people who work for the company and its concession operators will keep their jobs, are unclear.However, a rescue deal by a well-capitalised business like Sports Direct will at least preserve a significant number of jobs at HoF.More than 6,000 roles had already been earmarked to be lost as part of a controversial process which was subject to a now-settled legal challenge from some of HoF\u0027s landlords."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-manchester-city-premier-league_4330447.jpg?20180607202817 ","title":"my premier league prediction no change at the top","story":"Way below the Premier League was the verdict.

How can players who see so little of each other combine in a way that rivals what Pep Guardiola, for example, can achieve at Manchester City with some of the most talented men money can buy?And England? Gareth Southgate made the very best of limited resources, believe the top managers - squeezing crucial goals from free-kicks and corners.There will still be a feelgood factor in the stands, but the reality is that Guardiola is odds-on once more to win not only the battle of Manchester but also the title itself come May. Indeed, for a league that markets its competitiveness, if the title race gets as far as May it will be an improvement on last season, when City finished 19 points clear. Across the city at United, grumbly Jose Mourinho seems to have a huge battle on his hands to raise a smile, let alone a challenge.If United had a frustrating transfer window, Tottenham had a blank one.

The YouGov survey for the People’s Vote campaign found 50% believe the final decision on leaving the EU should be taken by the public, with a quarter opting to give Parliament the ultimate say. And Remainers would win a fresh vote by 53% to 47% when don’t knows are stripped out, according to an online poll of 10,000 voters. Theresa May has repeatedly insisted there will be no second referendum.  But Labour MP Chuka Umunna, of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “This significant new opinion poll shows growing and strong support for a people’s vote on the final Brexit deal.  “Politicians of all sides are increasingly trapped inside red lines of their own making, but the momentum this summer is with the campaign for a people’s vote as more and more people realise it’s the only way to take back control of the process. “It is clear from YouGov’s findings that public opinion is moving behind a People’s Vote across the political spectrum. This poll shows that Labour voters overwhelmingly support a People’s Vote, putting them at odds with the Party’s official pro-Brexit position.” Remainers are stepping up their fight for a second vote and deny it would be a rerun of the referendum two years ago.  Supporters of a fresh poll believe the 52% to 48% victory for Leave at the June 2016 referendum - the largest democratic exercise ever seen in Britain and which saw a 1.2 million majority wanting to quit the bloc - could now be overturned. But a second vote would fuel claims a pro-EU elite was failing to respect the result of the original poll, and risk alienating swathes of the electorate. Among Labour voters, 77% want to stay in the EU while just 23% want to quit the bloc, according to today’s (FRI) survey.  And 63% of those backing Jeremy Corbyn ’s party support a “people’s vote”, compared with 18% who oppose a fresh referendum. Some 19% don’t know.  Nearly three quarters of those polled - 73% - believe “many of the promises made by Leave campaign will be broken”, with only 13% disagreeing. And 68% believe Britain “will get a bad deal from Brexit talks”, with 13% disagreeing. Former YouGov president Peter Kellner said: “If the Brexit negotiations with Brussels break down, a two-to-one majority of voters want the public, not Parliament, to decide what happens. “Even people who voted Leave tend to prefer a new referendum, by 39 to 34%. This is politically significant. “There is clearly the potential for a broadly-based campaign this autumn for a people’s vote, should the Brussels talks go badly.

Inside was a rolled up scroll of paper – a real-life message in a bottle. It read: “Hugh Craggs, Yacht St George RTYC, Will any finder please enclose message bearing date, name of finder, of ship, destination, do a rebury and send a postcard to Hugh Craggs 50 Ruskin Ave Manor Park London E12.” It was dated Aug 1, 1924. Grant, 26, from Toronto, was keen to find out more about Hugh so, after the discovery in May, he asked for help on discussion website Reddit What emerged was an amazing tale of fantastic voyages, cannibals and pirate treasure, and how a teenager who set sail from London almost a century ago seeking adventure sure found it. In 1922, 18-year-old Hugh and his three brothers lived in East London with his mother Imogen, after the death of his father John, an inspector with Scotland Yard who was also a published poet. Hugh, an assistant in the hosiery business, longed to escape his dreary life.  He tried to join Sir Ernest Shackleton’s Antarctic expedition, but was not chosen. Then on a train one day he saw an advert for a steward on an expedition to be led by Dr Cyril Lockhart Cottle, and funded by Sir Jeremiah Colman of the famous mustard family. They were to set sail on a schooner called Malaya. Leaving the train at the next station he wired Dr Cottle and arranged to meet him, bubbling with so much enthusiasm he won over the adventurer, beating 2,000 other applicants. In a newspaper interview just before they embarked, Hugh said: “I’ve been longing to go on a trip of adventure for years. It’s come at last. “We are to be away for about three years. I expect to find all the things I’ve read about. Wild beasts, we’re looking for wild animals, savages, fights with natives, we’re ready for anything.” There is even a British Pathe News reel entitled ‘Dr Cottles’s Expedition To Cannibal Islands’ showing the 90-tonne Malaya before the voyage moored in a London dock. The prime purpose was to look for new species of porpoises and dolphins. Sadly they would do this “by harpooning them”. Dr Cottle said: “We shall probably go to Vigo then to the Canaries, to the West Indies, on to Colon through the Panama Canal from there to scattered South Sea islands. We may call at Samoa, North New Guinea, Singapore and North Sumatra. Parts of North Sumatra are totally uncivilised, peopled by man-eating natives.” Within days of leaving Britain, the Malaya ran into “mountainous seas for 12 hours” before seeking shelter in the Canaries. A newspaper reported the only casualty was its chimpanzee mascot which “came to an untimely end, having strangled itself”.  In the Daily Mirror of June 15, 1922, the chief officer Dr Sinclair of Glasgow had explained before embarkation: “It is a docile, clever and intelligent animal which sits at table and passes the salt or pepper as required.” The trip to the Galapagos, off the coast of Ecuador, where he left that message was to last more than three years. It seems travelling became a bit of a drug for young Hugh who did not return to Britain. Instead he disembarked in Colon, Panama, in February 1926.  He then moved to Cristobal, Panama, in 1929 where he became a banker and married an American called Gay, with whom he went on to have a daughter. But his adventurous spirit endured and Hugh had a dream of finding the  incredible Lima Treasure.  This is revealed in the 1935 book Rough and Tumble by Bob Roberts. In it another adventure-seeking sailor recounts: “In Cristobal we ran up against a young man named Hugh Craggs..[who]appeared vastly interested in our doings. “Craggs started talking of Cocos Island [around 350 miles off Costa Rica]. When serving in the Malaya he had spent 47 days there. The place fascinated him. “Stories of treasure said to have been buried there he had investigated and disproved so far as was humanly possible.” "},{"url":null,"title":"friends uks most popular streaming","story":"NewsFriends is the UK\u0027s most popular streaming show - why do we still love it?It\u0027s been 14 years since it ended, but we love Ross, Rachel, Monica, Joey, Chandler and Phoebe as much as always and it\u0027s emerged Friends is the UK\u0027s most popular streaming show - why do we still love it?

The reason for its eternal, unfaltering appeal? It does what it says on the tin. It’s your Friend. When it comes to watching telly, you could choose to experiment with something new, a show you’ve never seen before – take a risk that may or may not pay off. And sometimes that’s fun... even more rarely, it works out well and you’re pleased you did it. But more often than not, you’re left disappointed, confused, and feeling like you’ve totally wasted your evening. In these uncertain times, at the end of a long, tough day, the most comforting thing is to hang out with an old mucker.  Someone who’s been there for you, when the rain started to fall, for years and years now. Familiar, reliable, reassuring. Yes, you pretty much know the scripts off by heart at this point, but somehow the jokes are still funny. There are always one or two things that you didn’t(itals) remember, that really make you laugh. Some classic episodes that are always guaranteed to have you howling, in a good way. It’s not flawless of course – some of it has dated badly, there are dodgy attitudes to sexuality, body-shaming, trans rights etc... Friends as it was would never get made today... but that’s why it wasn’t. There’s also the age old boring criticism that Monica and Rachel would never be able to afford that massive apartment in central New York on their salaries blah blah blah zzzzzz. It’s not real life, it’s a TV show. And no, it’s not perfect. You have to accept it for what it is, and forgive it – just like you have to with real life friends.

Sadie Drew, 30, struggled to feed her kids and has had to turn to a food bank for help. To feed her children Sadie, from Cambourne, Cambridgeshire, like many others parents in the UK, relies on free school meals during term time. But when schools break up Sadie is left to find the extra food, and to make up the deficit she once went nearly a week without food. Now, Sadie is using her local CPR food banks to help feed the kids. Have you been struggling to feed your children after benefit cuts? Email webnews@mirror  She said: Kids don\u0027t stop eating, boredom kicks in and they replace that with food, and they just eat. Whereas in school they have certain snack times, and they are getting education, they are busy and their minds are ticking all the time. When that\u0027s not happening, they are just hungry all the time. It doesn\u0027t help when benefits cut you down from \u0026pound168 a week to \u0026pound116. It was tax credits, they decided they overpaid us two years ago, and they are taking it back at astronomical rates. Sadie says she feels no shame about using the food bank, because the welfare of her children is at stake.  My kids need to eat, and pride goes out the window when it involves children. If it was me, I\u0027d starve. I have done it for my children. Before I knew about the Foodbank and that I could get help, I was a single mum to my two girls and I didn\u0027t eat for six days straight. Without this place, it would be a major struggle. Don Gardner, who runs the CPR food banks at Camborne, Redruth and Pool, said children would go hungry this summer because their families relied on free school meals. On the first day of the holidays this year we gave out over 800 meals out in two hours, he said. That was a big afternoon we had. It made a very big dent in our stock. Two years ago we did 3,000 meals during the school holidays. We expect an increase in users because during term children are offered free school meals, and then suddenly mum\u0027s got two or three children at home and got to feed them for six weeks.

While travelling on the First Bus 24 from Easton to Bristol city centre, the 20-year-old was shocked when the driver launched into a tirade as soon as she got on with her two-month-old baby. The woman was wearing a niqab, which is a veil for the face that leaves the area around the eyes clear, and had just asked for the fare. But the driver asked her to remove the veil, insinuating she could  bomb the bus. “He said he couldn’t see my face, and that he didn’t know what I was ‘capable of doing’,” the mum, who asked not to be named, told Bristol Live . “He said I was scary and I was dangerous, and he kept talking about it during the journey. I didn’t say anything.  “He continued to insult me, and he made me out to be a terrorist, and kept saying everyone should see each other\u0027s faces. He asked why I was wearing a balaclava.” First Bus has now apologised, saying the driver had made a massive error. The mum added: “When we got to Primark, another woman asked me for my number and told me I should leave because I didn’t know how to deal with it. “I was on the bus and she said she would report him and asked for my number. “She started questioning him when I got off. “He was insinuating I was going to bomb the bus. How is that possible, when I’ve a baby with me?” After the bus stopped at the Haymarket, the mum got off before three other women decided to confront the bus driver. One of them was a woman wearing a hijab, a headscarf worn by Muslim women. The driver insisted he was right to ask her to remove her niqab, saying “the world was dangerous”, and that it was “not good”. The argument was filmed before he got off to speak to a manager and got back on the bus. The mum said: “It made me feel horrible and disappointed. I get that he might not be from the country, so maybe he has never seen a person with a face veil, but for him to treat me like that in a public place is wrong.  “I had my baby with me. I’ve been humiliated in public, and I’m disappointed. It’s 2018, we shouldn’t be like that. I’m being stereotyped.” The incident, which took place on July 1, has been reported to the police. First Bus only got back in touch with her to apologise after Bristol Live got in touch with the firm yesterday. She said: “First Bus hasn’t done anything about it and the way they’ve treated me is disgusting. I want to let people know what happened.

The pair moved into the home in Bilton, near Hull, with their children in the hope of a better life. But the plague has left them depressed and ruining the dream home they wished for.  More than 200 flies swarm their kitchen every day and some of the insects land on their faces at night, making it difficult to eat and sleep, reports the Hull Daily Mail .  Their house, along with others on the street, is close to the East Hull Community Farm, which the couple blame for the swarms of flies.  The farm says it has never had a complaint about flies and does everything in its power to limit the amount on the farm. But the couple believe livestock and manure bring the flies into their house. We have even been told by one neighbour that they\u0027ve had the problem with flies for the last 20 years, and there must be over 100 people that live down here and are struggling. The couple, who do not wish to be named, said they had health issues arising from the number of flies in their house. Our children have diarrhea from the flies as they are always landing on the food - I daren\u0027t even buy fresh food anymore for fear of the flies getting to it, they said.  This must be the only street that prays for winter - it was 52 degrees in the house the other day as we couldn\u0027t open any of the windows or doors for fear of more flies getting in. We started to decorate when we moved in, but have had to stop as the walls kept constantly getting covered in dead flies and were just covered in blood from where we had splattered them, so it was just a waste of time. The fly problem is affecting the health of the family, and is very traumatic for them.  It is just so horrible and is affecting us all mentally, as well as seeing it and coping with it physically, they said. The infestation is making me depressed and I just can\u0027t stand it going on any longer. It is an absolute joke, the temperature is soaring but we can\u0027t cool down, I don\u0027t want to get up on a morning to have to face it, and I can\u0027t get to sleep on a night as flies are just constantly landing on my face. We were happy to move to a big house with a big garden, but now we just don\u0027t want to be here anymore. We don\u0027t know how to get rid of the problem and have tried calling the farm, Environmental Health and the council, but we just keep getting passed from pillar to post. Hull City Council said: “We were contacted by the resident in July and we requested further information so that we could carry out an investigation into the cause of the problem. The resident supplied us with that information yesterday (August 7). We will be in touch with the resident with the results as soon as we get them. In terms of the cause of the problem, this cannot be determined until we have the results of the investigation.” To try and get rid of the flies, the unhappy couple are having to spend around \u0026pound50 per month on sprays and cleaning products, which is making a real dent into their finances.

But Mike claims the dream turned to disaster after he found the house allegedly filled with \u0027shoddy\u0027 building work - which has still not been fixed 16 months on.

The HGV compliance controller said: On the walk around we noticed things were wrong. But 16 months later they\u0027ve done little.  I decided to hang the sign because I was getting nowhere. If I\u0027d had seen something like that before I\u0027d bought my house I\u0027d have asked questions. I just want Persimmon to recognise my problems and to sort out the issues I\u0027ve got. All I want is what I paid for but for them to come anywhere near that seems difficult. It\u0027s stressful and it\u0027s frustrating. You buy new, you expect new, we\u0027re far from it.  If I\u0027d have seen the house before I bought it I don\u0027t think I would have done so. The general quality of the work is appalling. Mike claims the property, which he shares with his young son and partner, has ill-fitting brickwork, leaking shower cubicles and baths, poor plaster work and architraves which aren\u0027t level. He also claims brickwork and door frames are below standard.  In July, he took the drastic step of putting a poster up on the front of his house to share his experience with other prospective buyers looking at houses on the estate. Mike added: The brickwork replicates a climbing wall. There are a lot of damaged bricks and it looks sloppy. The woodwork is shoddy too. A number of the architraves and door frames aren\u0027t level. Persimmon have come to do work but then left it unfinished.  It almost feels like they expect the buyer to sort the problems out themselves. I\u0027ve lost count of how many days I\u0027ve taken off for people to come and they\u0027ve either not turned up or not done a very good job. I don\u0027t think it replicates value for money.

Thunderstorms swept across south east England on Tuesday, bringing an abrupt end to Britain’s month-long heatwave prompting a severe weather warning from the Met Office. The “be aware” alert warning of frequent lightning, heavy rain - up to 30mm in an hour in some places - large hail and strong gusts was removed in the early hours of Wednesday morning.

We also invited VC to meet us on Tuesday but they did not respond to this invitation. Our pilots in Germany enjoy excellent working conditions. They are paid up to €190,000 a year and, as well as additional benefits, they received a 20 per cent pay increase at the start of this year. Ryanair pilots earn at least 30 per cent more than Eurowings and 20 per cent more than Norwegian pilots.  We asked VC to provide us with at least seven days\u0027 notice of any planned strike action so that we could notify our customers of cancelled flights in advance and offer them alternative flights or refunds, but they have refused to do this and instead call an unnecessary strike in Germany in just two days\u0027 time. Ryanair is ready to continue these negotiations.

The mercury dropped to two-month low in parts of the country, down 10C from the start of the week, as heavy downpours and winds of up to 70mph are forecast. Only the southeast of England, which has endured brunt of the heatwave, will see the warm and more settled conditions of the summer. The hot weather came to an abrupt and wet end as the tail end of an Atlantic storm brought torrential rain and thunderstorms to parts of the UK.  Tropical storm Debby strengthened over the far North Atlantic on Wednesday, with maximum sustained winds of 45 miles per hour. The storm system formed around 1,200 miles (1931km) east of Boston on Tuesday but is not expected to make landfall in the United States, according to the National Hurricane Center.  People leaving Hammersmith tube station in west London were provided with the makeshift \u0027bridge\u0027 by staff at a nearby branch of Pret-a-Manger, who later tweeted to say we chair-ish our customers. Transport for London urged passengers to avoid the station after inches of rain fell in under an hour as the rush hour got underway. Underground staff eventually decided to shut the station due to fears of overcrowding as so many people were trapped in the exit by rising water.  Meanwhile, a mini ‘twister’ was spotted swirling around the skies over Cheshire. The tornado-like cloud formed above Poynton, Bollington and Macclesfield at around lunchtime today. Jennie Lewis snapped the weather phenomenon from her window in Higher Poynton at around 12.15pm. Jennie, 48, said: “I was in my kitchen having an early lunch and it started raining. “We had a really heavy downpour and then I saw this unusual cloud forming. I ran upstairs to grab my camera and by then you could see the rain and cloud twisting. “It looked like something out of a film. The cloud was getting longer but it eventually dissipated. “I’ve always been interested in the weather and this was a really unusual sight.”  Other witnesses said the twister disappeared before it touched the ground. No damage has been reported to the police, a spokesman for Cheshire Constabulary said. The Met Office only define a cloud as a tornado if it touches the ground. It is possible the sight was a funnel cloud, which is the same as a tornado - it just doesn’t reach the earth. A tornado is a rapidly rotating column of air that reaches from the base of a storm cloud to the ground. They happen in unsettled weather conditions, usually as part of thunderstorms. If the rotating column of air does not reach the ground it is a funnel cloud. At the point a funnel cloud reaches the earth’s surface it becomes a tornado, or if it reaches a body of water it becomes a waterspout.

The order, from contractors Wilson James, came after just one customer complaint. Staff have branded the move small-minded.    Mirror columnist and Loose Women star Coleen Nolan launches a passionate defence of affectionate nicknames.   Sweetheart, honeybun, babe – call me any affectionate name you like and keep calling me it.  Hearing that Gatwick staff have been ordered to stop using “love” and “darling” for customers made my eyes roll and heart sink.  Political correctness went mad a long time ago – this is taking it to crazy new levels. Because if people are now offended by the word “love”, there’s no point in getting out of bed in the morning. I give up. A ban isn’t just small-minded, it’s downright pea-brained. What next? Will we be banned from giving people a hug and asking, ‘Are you OK, love?’, when they’re crying? I refuse to go along with that. You’ll have to put gaffer tape on my mouth and handcuffs behind my back. I’ve always called people close to me, or strangers being nice to me, things like “babe”. Pet names are friendly and affectionate. There’s kindness and sweetness behind them and they come from a good place. And they’re quintessentially British. Just as our accents vary wildly between areas just a few miles away, so do our pet names. Growing up in Blackpool, we called each other “love”. My next door neighbours were Scottish and called me “hen”.  Not far away in Stoke they refer to each other as “duck”, Newcastle women are usually “pet” and in Sunderland they’re “flower”. If we’re now expected to stop using these names which say so much about our upbringing, regional identity and tradition, I refuse. There’s ingenuity behind pet names, too. They mask the fact we sometimes forget real names. Maybe that’s why “darling” is used so often in the showbiz world. It’s definitely the reason mum called me “baby”: as the youngest of eight I reckon she often forgot my name. My mum also called me eejit, and I think and hope that was with affection (it’s an Irish thing). I call my two sons “handsome” and daughter “gorgeous” all the time because it’s a term of endearment and I mean it. If I’m called a pet name I feel warm and fuzzy. If an elderly person calls me “love”, I feel young. Colleagues call me “darling” or “love” all the time and it reminds me we have friendship that goes past the formal stage. If a young man calls me “babe”, I feel weak. If pet names like “gorgeous” might be a bit flirty and suggestive, so what? I love harmless flirting. And if builders shout: “Hello sexy!” at me, I’d walk round in circles to hear it again. It doesn’t happen much these days, though. I stand for hours and they don’t even stop their drills.

Lenders such as Wonga and Quick Quid have been accused of dragging their heels on paying back customers charged sky-high rates on short-term loans they had no hope of paying back.   The Financial Conduct Authority ordered the lenders to make amends to borrowers who had been dragged into further debt before a cap was imposed on the industry’s charges in 2014.  But compensation experts claim the firms’ response has been sluggish, with over a million customers still owed payouts over the controversy. Vincent Vernon of Pay Day Refunds said it is handling 32,000 customers claims, a quarter of them with Wonga. He added: “There could be in excess of a million customers who have suffered as a result of irresponsible lending who are owed money back. “Three of the poorest-responding lenders are Wonga, Curo and Quick Quid. These lenders are continuing to ignore UK consumer rights towards their irresponsible lending. They’re fast to lend and extremely slow to repay.” James Walker, from complaints service Resolver, added: “Of all the mis-selling scandals of recent decades, the millions of payday loans flogged to hard-up people struggling to make ends meet is both tragic and outrageous. “Astronomical loans were sold, with little to no checks, leaving desperate people averaging seven loans each at any given time and borrowing to pay off their other loans. Every loan carried huge interest that often made debt worse.”  He claimed firms are shutting down customers’ online accounts to “make it difficult for customers to make claims”. But he added: “The fact that people’s accounts no longer exist online doesn’t mean they lose their right to complain. “As with any other loan, credit or financial product, the firm must keep a record of historic loans, which most do for the statutory six years and often longer.” Wonga said: “We assess customer claims on a case-by-case basis. In line with regulatory standards, it can take up to eight weeks before a claim is processed.” Last week it emerged Wonga had to call on its own financial backers for \u0026pound10million to save it from going bust.

The hot weather has led to rice, maize and other crops withering in the fields, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said today. The world\u0027s largest disaster relief network warned of a risk of a full-blown food security crisis in the isolated country, saying that the worrying situation had been exacerbated by international sanctions imposed due to North Korea\u0027s nuclear and missile programmes. There had been no rainfall since early July as temperatures soared to an average 39C across the country, whose official name is the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea (DPRK), and the next rain was expected in mid-August, it said.  The population of 25 million is already stressed and vulnerable with malnutrition among children that could worsen, it said in a statement issued in Geneva. This is not yet classified as a drought, but rice, maize and other crops are already withering in the fields, with potentially catastrophic effects for the people of DPRK, said Joseph Muyamboit, its programme manager in Pyongyang.  We cannot and must not let this situation become a full-blown food security crisis, he said. We know that previous serious dry spells have disrupted the food supply to a point where it has caused serious health problems and malnutrition across the country. The Federation was helping the national Red Cross to support 13,700 of the most vulnerable people at risk. It had deployed emergency response teams and 20 water pumps to irrigate fields in the hardest-hit areas, it said.  David Beasley, the head of the UN\u0027s World Food Programme (WFP), visited North Korea in May to look into boosting food distributions to hungry women and children, in the latest sign of an opening. About 70 percent of North Koreans are food insecure, meaning they struggle to avoid hunger, and one in four children under five is stunted from chronic malnutrition, the WFP said at the time.

He was drained of colour and appeared to be walking in slow motion towards her. She didn\u0027t know what they had told him, but she knew it wasn\u0027t good news. Renae had just had an MRI scan to be on the safe side while trying to find the cause of her crippling headache. But as her husband Jared walked towards her in the hospital waiting room, her life - and his - changed forever. We both just looked at each and cried, she told MamaMia . As it turned out, her \u0027migraine\u0027 was a tumour. I was told if I had left it another 24 hours I would be dead, added the 39-year-old, who lives in Australia.  Renae had been in the waiting room for a while, awaiting the results of the scan, when she started feeling sick. With her head pounding, she sent Jared to tell doctors that they were going home because she wanted to crawl into bed. But in the minutes that followed, she found out she would not be getting into bed as she had hoped.  Instead, she was rushed to the emergency department at a nearby hospital. Days earlier, she had rung her twin sister Nicole, who suffers from migraines, to see if she had any suggestions on how to cure her thumping headache that she\u0027d had four days straight. She described it as being annoying more than painful and usual remedies hadn\u0027t worked. Nicole suggested Renae contact her GP believing it may be a migraine, which are common in their family.  The GP suggested the MRI scan as Renae had never suffered such severe headaches before. But no one expected it to uncover she had a massive tumour - and that she had only 24 hours left to live. Renae spent the next five days in hospital having multiple scans while being monitored around the clock. Following an operation and 19 staples in the back of her head , the tumour was removed. But the worst was still to come. Renae was allowed home but was told not to do everyday tasks such as drive, cook or lift anything too heavy. Then five days later, fluid began leaking from the area she had been operated on and more surgery followed. She spent more than a week confined to her bed, unable to move without warning a nurse first.  This was the hardest of all of it, Renae said, writing on a GoFundMe page set up to help cover the cost of her medical treatment. I cried so much. I felt completely helpless. For the first time, I was scared and nervous about what was happening to me. It was then that Renae was given the devastating melanoma cancer diagnosis - despite religiously lathering herself in sun cream throughout her life. She was told it had no known primary source and had the Braf gene. In the words of the oncologists \u0027it has its foot on the accelerator,\u0027 she said. It was suggested to Renae she take a combination of drugs to \u0027buy her time\u0027. How much? No one can tell you, she said. According to the oncologist \u0027some people live, some people die. We don’t know why some do and some don’t\u0027.  And devastatingly a few weeks ago, another large tumour was found at the back of Renae\u0027s brain, along with three to four smaller ones. She was forced to undergo another operation to try and remove them, despite being told the treatment had been working and another tumour had shrunk to be almost non-existant. I was in the intensive care unit overnight and for much of the next day before being moved into my own private room again. I suffered severe and regular nausea and vomiting, she said. This is completely devastating news as there were no signs that my treatment wasn\u0027t working. The MRI scans were being performed less frequently as the tumours had been shown to be shrinking each time. It really feels like reliving it all over again from the beginning again.

He told the community council: “Fintry Mill centre doesn’t have enough doctors.“I’ve suggested splitting the doctors across the two sites, but the owners are saying they have more than 3,000 patients at Arthurstone, which is the bigger of the two.“It would appear doctors are going into the locum system rather than becoming regular GPs because they don’t have the extra responsibility of managing the surgery.”Problems with recruiting permanent family doctors are ongoing for health boards across the country.A new GP contract was agreed by the British Medical Association and the Scottish Government this year that aims to make general practice more attractive.Key points of the new deal include a guaranteed minimum salary of £80,000 and GPs being relieved of administrative duties.The Tele asked NHS Tayside if it was aware of Fintry Mill’s plans.A spokeswoman confirmed the health board was aware. She said: “Fintry Mill Practice will reopen on Monday August 13 following the six-week temporary closure.“All health boards across Scotland are currently facing a national shortage of GPs and NHS Tayside is no exception.“Feedback gathered from the recent public consultation exercise will be used to inform the recommendations to Dundee Integration Joint Board and NHS Tayside in the coming weeks.“A final decision will be made (on Fintry Mill) in due course.”Fintry Mill manager Gordon Bain was asked to comment, but did not respond to the Tele’s requests.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b6c280f95fbb.jpg ","title":"dundee people dundee student raises 5k for foreign friend by walking length of uk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA student has completed an incredible challenge by walking the length of the UK to raise money for a friend on the other side of the world.Dundee University student Daniel Angelosanto, 24, set off from Land’s End on May 21 with the target of reaching John O’Groats in three months.He walked a total of 1,100 miles before reaching the north of Scotland, crossing Exmoor, the Peak District and the West Highland Way on his route.He said: “It’s only been a couple of days since I finished so it doesn’t feel like it’s over yet.“The sights have been amazing and I have met a lot of people along the way who told me I was crazy.“There were a few days that were frustrating and tough going.“A few of the walking paths haven’t been used in a long time and are overgrown so I’d come out at the end covered in nettle stings.

He is strong in the air and a powerful player.“He is one of the best players in the air I have worked with.“He’s not Messi or Maradona but he’s a very hard worker and as a box player is excellent. I think he is perfect for Scottish football.“When I signed him before he was very good for me and he got his move to Aalborg on the back of that.“He has trained with us now but he is still a player at Aalborg so it is in the hands of the two clubs.”Safranko made 28 appearances for AaB last season but has dropped to the bench for the early games of this term after a formation change.That’s prompted him to seek a regular starting place elsewhere in a bid to add to his two Slovakia caps and he sees teaming up with his old boss again as the perfect way to achieve that.Although United have not ruled out a move for Austrian attacker Toni Vastic after his trial last week, with Safranko not coming cheap, that now looks unlikely.Csaba, meanwhile, has apologised to fans for his team’s poor showing in Saturday’s defeat against Dunfermline.He’s made it clear the display that led to three second half goals being conceded at Tannadice was unacceptable.“I have to apologise to the fans, for all the people who like and love Dundee United, for the performance and the result on Saturday.“The second half was nowhere near good enough, it wasn’t acceptable,” he added.“It was not what the fans, the staff and even the players wanted.“The players told me, gaffer we have to go and really tell everybody sorry but I take the responsibility.“Of course, we know every team can lose games but we know we should not lose like we did in the match.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united have to start getting it right from now on says edjenguele","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWith so many changes to the squad taking place over the summer, experienced defender William Edjenguele knows it was always going to take new-look Dundee United time to gel.However, the experience the 31-year-old has amassed over his career and, in particular, of life in the Championship over the past two seasons with the Tangerines, tells him they better find a way to do it quickly.Like every other United player, the big Frenchman was gutted by Saturday’s 3-2 home defeat at the hands of Dunfermline in their league opener.It goes without saying that loss was not what the incumbents of the Tannadice dressing-room wanted or expected.“It was the first game of the season and at home, so you want to start well and that’s what we didn’t do,” he said.“In the first half we didn’t play particularly well but we managed to get the first goal and it looked the kind of game where the team who got it would be the winner.“And I thought in the first half, while we were not playing that well, neither team was. However, we were showing togetherness and real fight.“Second half there were a few mistakes and that cost us the game.“We were a bit unlucky as well because there was a handball in the move for their second goal and it should have been a foul for us.“You can’t use that as an excuse because he (the referee) did not give it and you have to defend the situation.”Neither will Edjenguele use the vast changes to the squad over the summer to deflect from what fans had a right to expect to be a much better start.The weekend saw nine men in tangerine making their league debuts for the club.That meant only two of the team that beat the Pars over two legs in the promotion play-off quarter-final just last May, were involved in the United starting line-up.Having been at eight clubs in his 13-year senior career, he knows better than most that any new group needs time to get to know each other and that’s definitely the case at Tannadice where he’s never seen so many comings and goings in such a short period.He’s well aware, however, that, while that process could take two or three months, it cannot be at the expense of results.“Definitely it will take time. I don’t even know how many players exactly came in but it was a lot.“There were a lot of changes, so we definitely need some time to gel together.“And I should say I do respect Dunfermline. They are a good side, especially going forward, and they have some decent players. So if you don’t play well they can beat you.“At home you expect us to do a bit better than that. Everybody is disappointed but we have to go again.“It was a hard day but we have to make sure we are better right away because the one thing that you find out is the season goes by fast and we have to be ready to go quickly.“We have to play better, starting with the next game. It’s as simple as that.”After the struggles of the Betfred Cup group that saw United come out on top in just one of their four ties and even then only after they already knew they were out of the competition, it’s fair to say many supporters feared the worst going into the Dunfermline clash.Edjenguele, though, insists the players had been in confident mood.The feeling was they were coming together as a team and would be ready for the opening 90 minutes of league action. That, of course, only made defeat more painful.“Some of the results in the cup were not good until the Elgin game,” he said.“We were making progress and things were moving in the right direction, so this was a real setback.“Like I say, now we must work to make sure we are ready this week.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united seek boost from returning booth","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United hope to be boosted by the return of summer signing Callum Booth for their weekend trip to Queen of the South.After shunning interest from several Premiership outfits to join the Tangerines from Partick Thistle, the full-back was regarded as one of the major close-season signings at Tannadice.To date, though, the 27-year-old has only managed one competitive appearance.That came in the Betfred Cup defeat at Ross County last month and although he completed 90 minutes, a knock picked up in Dingwall has left him struggling since.Manager Csaba Laszlo, though, is hopeful he’ll be working with the squad this week and be ready for some involvement in Dumfries.“Callum Booth, we are hopeful he is full in the training and we can see how he is,” said Csaba.After shipping three poor goals in the second half of Saturday’s opening-day defeat against Dunfermline, getting Booth back would add quality and experience.Csaba is also hoping another week’s full training for striker Craig Curran will help his sharpness.A dead leg in pre-season meant his debut was delayed until the weekend and although the manager was pleased with the Englishman’s work, it was clear he’s not 100% match fit.“Craig Curran was three weeks out and the he just came back.“He did well in the first half but you saw that after 45 minutes he struggled to keep the ball.”Still missing could be Stewart Murdoch because of a knee problem and Billy King looks to be some way off playing due to the thigh problem that’s dogged him since he reported back for pre-season work.While Csaba does not hide the loss of those players at various times has been a blow, he’s made clear he wants more from those who are on the pitch.“They are important players but on the other side you have other players who stay in the pitch and I want to see them make competition for the players who are out.”Craig Easton’s second string will open their reserve league account when they travel to St Mirren on August 20.

He’s got the character to brush this off and against Aberdeen on Saturday, he’ll have no qualms going back in there and making saves.“Fans can be very fickle and obviously as a keeper mistakes are highlighted because they cost goals but Jack has the ability to go and be a hero this week.“In pre-season he obviously did something right to convince Neil McCann to put him in and take over from Elliott Parish.“Neil took Jack into the club to play and one mistake isn’t going to change that.“Over the course of the season I have no doubt he’ll save more points for Dundee than he’ll cost them.”Soutar admits Hamilton is suffering the “life of a goalie” at the moment, a position where an error more often than not leads to conceding a goal.However, as a Dundee fan himself, Soutar is backing the Dens faithful to get behind their new keeper this weekend and manager Neil McCann to stick with Hamilton between the posts.“Everybody makes mistakes and there will be some supporters who will be on your back from the first minute but as a goalkeeper you just have to go back in and make saves for your team,” he added.“Dundee fans, though, always forgive – it’s a speciality of the Dee support.“He lost the ball and lost a goal but if he goes and megs a boy on Saturday everybody will love him!“I think the manager will stick with him – it highlights the error more if he makes a switch.“Neil had obviously seen enough in Jack to start him this season and I think he should stick by that decision, at least for the first few games.“I had a terrible week myself at Dunfermline when Jim Duffy was manager at Dens – he could’ve dropped me but he stuck by me and I ended up being Man of the Match against Motherwell the next week.“The worst thing for Jack would be to drop him – let him get it out of his system and go play.“It’s the life of a goalie – everyone forgets the good stuff when you make a mistake.”Getting used to a new way of playing takes every player a bit of time to adjust – with the league campaign already under way, however, Soutar admits Hamilton will need to get used to playing out from the back quickly.“At Hearts over the last few years, the team has been a more physical side rather than the footballing team Dundee like to be.“Jack has to adapt to that very quickly, though. The manager likes to play out from the back and he’ll have to get used to it.“Sometimes, though, as a goalie when you’re under pressure, you just have to stick it in row Z and deal with the flak afterwards.“Jack will learn from it, though.“It’s still early days for him. It’s only one game and I’d back him to put in a performance on Saturday.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b6c2727efb71.jpg ","title":"shock as satan lives here scrawled in blue ink appears on walls of dundee multi","story":"\t\t\t\t\tResidents have spoken of their shock after a series of “bizarre” religious messages appeared in a Hilltown multi – claiming that Satan lived there.The unusual literature is understood to have appeared in Bonnethill Court this week.A resident who declined to be named said the messages had been scrawled on walls in blue pen.Numerous floors in the communal stairwell appeared to have been targeted during the vandalism spree.Messages, including “God is power and heroin is a sin” and “Satan lives here” appeared on the floors near the top of the building.It is unclear who wrote them, but some messages made reference to the Gate Church.The church, which is based on Perth Road, denied any involvement.A Gate Church elder explained they did not condone damage of property by graffiti or any other means.The spokesman said: “Our church is committed to protecting our environment and the community around us and invests in projects that sustain and improve the area.“This Christian faith is a message of love and not hate towards those around us.“The messages written do not reflect our values or faith correctly.”A tenant at the block added: “These messages have appeared within the last two to three days.“It is a bit bizarre, if not a wee bit unsettling.“Some are proclaiming Satan lives here, telling people they will burn in hell.“This type of stuff has been written on walls on a number of floors.“It’s certainly not the usual type of vandalism we would expect to see.“We normally have drug paraphernalia left in the block so I don’t know if someone has had enough and decided to voice their frustrations in this manner.“I wouldn’t imagine someone in here would have written something like this.“I’m not sure if the matter has been reported to the concierge service as of yet.”A spokesman for Dundee City Council confirmed the local authority was aware of graffiti at the premises.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b69627bdece2-448x564.jpg ","title":"tom duthie patience and time in short supply for dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs the dust settles on a disappointing opening-day result against Dunfermline at Tannadice, a few moments’ calm reflection could lead to the conclusion all this Dundee United squad needs to be Championship contenders is a little time and patience.Give Csaba Laszlo’s rebuilt squad a few more weeks to gel and they could be a strong force at this level.And a little patience during those weeks to forgive mistakes that are probably inevitable would help with that process.So much for the theory, now for the harsh reality. It can be summed up with the following words – tough luck, because both are going to be in short supply.When it comes to the first, the fact is the time to be ready for any league season is on day one.At the weekend, United were not and that’s why, despite losing out to the odd goal in five, they were comprehensively beaten by a Pars outfit that was ready for action while they were found lacking.In pointing that out, it’s worth remembering that, although Dunfermline’s wasn’t quite to the same extent, over the summer circumstances meant they were forced to undertake a major overhaul of their squad that saw players leave and 10 new faces brought in.That was not least because they lost two of their key performers, Nicky Clark and Fraser Aird, to the Tangerines. Despite that, particularly during the second half of the weekend game, the visitors looked a strong and cohesive unit that was sound at the back and dangerous going forward.By way of contrast, the longer the game went on the more disjointed United became.However valid the reasons for that may be, the rest of the Championship is not going to sit back and give them time to get their act together.In Dumfries this weekend it’s more than reasonable to expect Queen of the South to do all they can to come out of the blocks quickly, hit United hard and early and try to stay on top of them.That’s just common sense and an approach that’s to be expected from the opposition for weeks to come, if not longer.Put simply, when a team looks as vulnerable as Csaba Laszlo’s do, they are going to be tested early in games and it’s only by winning matches they can expect opponents to start cautiously.As for patience, something being sought from fans, there has to be a realisation that among Arabs it’s not so much worn thin as disintegrated.A support that’s been used to top-six finishes in the Premiership and cup final appearances, has been put through hell and are now facing a third season out of the top flight.So much so that when new chairman Mike Martin addresses them, he often starts off with an apology, and wisely so.Through no fault of their own, supporters have been stuck in a long dark tunnel and, if they cannot see any light at the end of it, they cannot be asked to show understanding.Make no mistake about it, their team is where it is because results dictate that’s their true position in Scottish football.But when they look at where Dundee United have been and the lingering perception of it as a size of club, the very least Arabs have a right to expect is a side that’s challenging to get back up.Some 5,000 of them turned up for the league opener and gave yet another indication of where United could be.No other clubs outside of the Old Firm, Aberdeen, Hearts and Hibs can rely on that kind of turn-out on a Saturday.If this team don’t start producing, they’ll not be able to either.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3f72fc1f703.jpg ","title":"tourist numbers surge as hotels reap benefits of dundees regeneration","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee’s regeneration is already bearing fruit with a huge upsurge in the number of tourists visiting the city.Figures released by Dundee City Council revealed in the year to April 2017 there was a near 10% rise in the number of overnight visitors to Dundee, leading to a £172 million contribution to the city’s economy, up 8% from the year before.Visitors staying at least one night in the city rose by 9.8% to 467,900, while day visitors also increased to 412,520, up 3.2%.An extra £68m flowed into the city from business events and the 255,000 delegates who attended conferences. Such events secured 48,000 bed nights in hotels in the city during 2016-17, up 7.4% on the previous 12 months.Lynne Short, convener of Dundee City Council’s city development committee, said: “For the economic impact of tourism on the local economy to increase by such an amount is a fantastic rate of growth in a single year.“When you consider that people who came here to attend a business event spent on average two to three times more than leisure visitors, their importance to the economy cannot be underestimated.”Among the day visitors to the city last year were 19,000 who came to Dundee on one of the many cruise ships to dock.The figures also reveal hotel occupancy over the same period was 77% overall. Budget hotels had an occupancy rate of 78%, with full service hotels at 85%.Tourism chiefs are looking to bring in £185m to the city economy by 2020, and are targeting 520,000 staying visitors and 600,000 day visitors.The opening of the V\u0026ampA next month is expected to attract tens of thousands more people to Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film

Initially thought to be those of a notorious clan chief nicknamed the Old Fox, they were discovered to be those of a young woman plus four others.Previously, the mausoleum and burial ground drew in a few hundred people each year but last year numbers were between 2000 and 2500 - although it could be higher as not all visitors are recorded.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhile the burial ground is owned by Highland Council, the 17th century building is owned by the voluntary-run Wardlaw Mausoleum Trust which faces a constant challenge regarding its maintenance.Trust member Erik Lundberg said it was a technically-challenging task to carry out appropriate upkeep and repairs to the building given its age and construction.There was a problem with persistent moisture, for example, caused by an adjoining burial area having a higher ground level than the mausoleum.\"The trust was set up in the early 1990s to take over the ownership and eventual restoration of the mausoleum and that was done in 1998,\" Mt Lundberg said.\"The only income the trust gets is from donations from visitors. When you don\u0026rsquot get as many visitors as you would like especially up until recent years, you don\u0026rsquot really have the funds to maintain the building as you would like.\"He explained that the building should undergo lime rendering to the outside and lime plastering to the inside plus coats of lime wash about every five years.

Sir Alex Ferguson took chances with the Class of ’92 at Manchester United and he took chances playing young kids at Aberdeen.“He gave Eric Black, John Hewitt and others their chance and they came through.“It would be good to see another striker like Bruce come through because if you’re good enough, you’re old enough, in my opinion.”Dons gaffer McInnes is still hoping to sign another striker before the transfer window closes at the end of the month – and ideally he would like another frontman in before Saturday’s game with Dundee.With Adam Rooney leaving the Granite City for Salford City earlier in the summer, Aberdeen have two senior strikers in Stevie May and Sam Cosgrove.May, a £400,000 signing from Preston North End a year ago, struggled in his first campaign – particularly after an injury sustained in December against Rangers after a bad tackle from Ryan Jack, while Cosgrove – who joined in January from Carlisle – is only 20 and has yet to score in a competitive game for the Dons.McDougall joined Aberdeen in 1984 from St Mirren and helped the Reds win the Premier Division title in 1985 and the League Cup and Scottish Cup the following season.After his goal-laden time at Pittodrie, he was forced to retire in 1987, aged 29, due to injury.McDougall believes McInnes is right to try to add another striker and believes the goals of Rooney need to be replaced.He also reckons it’s important Aberdeen bide their time and wait for the right attacker to become available.McDougall added: “I think they need another striker added to their squad. Derek McInnes knows that and is working on it they lost Adam Rooney to Salford and his goals need replaced.“They need more firepower up front than what they have at the moment.“I just don’t see enough goals in the senior strikers. I’d love to see it but I feel they need a little bit more.“There have been encouraging signs for the season – they did well against Burnley in the Europa League and Lewis Ferguson looks a good player – but I would like to see another striker signed.“You can get strikers but Aberdeen don’t want to take in anybody, they need somebody with a bit of class because they want to keep moving forward.“Derek’s resources are limited so he’s right to wait for the right striker because he wants to make the right decision.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen retailer thanks customers as sports shop shuts down","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen shop owner has thanked customers as they took the sad decision to shut down.Independent sports store, The Running Shop, announced on social media this afternoon they would be closing down.The owner of the George Street store said: \u0026#8220It’s with huge sadness that I’ve decided to close The Running Shop.\u0026#8220Unfortunately, due to a lot of factors affecting Aberdeen and the retail sector at the moment, it\u0026#8217s just not been possible to keep going as an independent business.\u0026#8220I want to thank everyone for your friendship and support, it really has been amazing.

With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains.

A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

Kieran has a lot of hard work to do in terms of fitness and strength to get up to speed at that level, but he must go and enjoy and embrace the whole experience.\u0026#8216He will only get out of it what he puts in in terms of effort.\u0026#8217PICS:Kieran Moore in typical style for Red Star \u0026#8211 driving at defenders heading for goal. 06_a46RedStarTarbert03Signing on \u0026#8211 Queen\u0026#8217s Park manager Gus MacPherson with Kieran Moore. no_a30KieranMoore_QueensPark04In a pre-season match for Queen\u0026#8217s Park. no_a30KieranMoore_QueensPark01Resplendent in his new Queen\u0026#8217s Park colours. no_a30KieranMoore_QueensPark05\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"mach 1 rally gets a local spin","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 28/07/18, 11:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAs reported in the July 20 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, rally crews headed to Kintyre a week earlier to take part in the annual Mach 1 stages rally, organised by Dunfermline Car club at Machrihanish airbase.Photographs courtesy of Victoria Davidson-Kinghorn.Local crews to take part this year included Kilmartin\u0026#8217s William Beattie and also Willie Beattie junior in their mk2 Escorts, who battled it out in class three. Sadly the rally was over for both crews after stage four due to electrical problems and other issues.Donald Bowness battled it out in the usual competitive class two with his Vauxhall Nova with Andrew Blackwood on the notes. Bowness enjoyed the battle with Michael Harbour during a Saturday which saw crews struggle to keep cars cool while specators looked on in glorious sunshine. Rally journalist John Fife was prompted to comment: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s like watching two spoilt weans scrapping over one tube of smarties.\u0026#8217Sunday saw a complete change in the weather and crews continued to battle it out in some very wet and slippy stages. Donald Bowness finished 11th overall and first in class two, followed by Michael Harbour in second. Another local man, Jamie Miller, finished an impressive third in the class on what was his first time out in his new car \u0026#8211 without so much as  a test drive in his the Citroen C2R2 Max.Class one saw Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter battle it out in Innes\u0026#8217 newly built Rover , with another excellent drive from the pair who also finished the rally with a trophy win, coming third in their class. Alan \u0026#8216Goldie\u0026#8217 Ross decided not to enter this year as he is selling his Citroen Saxo rally car and instead enjoyed the rally from the spectating areas.The overall winners of the 2018 Mach 1 stages were Bruce Edwards and Jim Smith in the Darrian follwed by Gordon Morrison and Calum Macpherson in their Subaru Impreza and third place went to Ian Paterson and Callum Shanks also in a Subaru Impreza.All the local drivers appreciate the efforts of Davie Hatrick and the team behind the scenes of DCC, who put so much time and effort to bring this fantastic rally to Argyll each year.The rally is always on the lookout for new volunteers to marshal at the event, this is a great opportunity for locals to get up close to the action and learn more about the sport.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 30","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 9:27 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,As usual with Councillor Redman, he was so desperate to berate the SNP in his letter published in the July 20 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser that he is unable to see the hypocrisy of his own stance.He talks of \u0026#8216stealth taxes\u0026#8217 hitting \u0026#8216the most vulnerable people in our society, particularly elderly people living alone\u0026#8217.His accusation of \u0026#8216taking their eye off the day job\u0026#8217 begs the question as to where he was when the Tory government introduced its bedroom tax \u0026#8211 a tax on those who needed an extra room for live-in carers, a tax on grandparents who wanted to have their grandchildren to stay for weekends and at holiday times a tax on widows with sons and daughters in the armed forces expected to sleep on a sofa when home on leave.A disgraceful tax which the SNP government abolishedDavid Hay, MinardSir,It was superb to once again meet up with locals in Whitehouse and across west Kintyre. As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray golf club hold gents open","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 31/07/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe 2018 Gents Open was held on Saturday July 28.Despite the heavy overnight rain the course held up well and was in great condition for the players.The competition was well contested in both the scratch and net categories.The net competition was won by Neil Armour with an impressive 71.

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Fraser Watt gave them the lead on 17 minutes and Lewis Montgomery added a second on 33 minutes.A second from Fraser Watt five minutes later made it 3-0 at the break.James Cameron pulled a goal back for Inverness on 54 minutes but most of the pressure was around the Inverness goal. Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players. Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income. However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process.

The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust. In the first instance this will involve running a number of football-related activities at Ardrishaig Gala Day.Hamish Nicol, chairman of the Ardrishaig Community Trust said: ‘In the official year of young people we are a delighted to support an organisation who match our ambitions to create a better tomorrow for our young people.‘The trust has been very active behind the scenes over the last few years and this three year programme of support allows us to raise our profile.’\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead dancer wins big at southend games","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 7:13 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTen-year-old Olivia Veitch was celebrating with her family after an amazing performance at Southend Games.The highland dancer won first place in Highland Laddie, Barracks Johnnie and Reel of Tulloch and second place in Seann Triubhas and Highland Fling, also winning the overall intermediate section.The dancer from Lochgilphead dances at the James McCorkindale School of Dancing in Campbeltown.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sea unites the story of inverarays ferry","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 05/08/18, 8:55 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowBy Colin CameronMuch of the detail in this feature comes from two booklets written by the late Donald MacKechnie, the well-known Inveraray schoolmaster and local historian.The booklets, \u0026#8216Inveraray Notes\u0026#8217 and \u0026#8216Inveraray Tales and Traditions\u0026#8217, were published in the 1980s.Look out for tales from these fascinating booklets in coming editions of the Argyllshire Advertiser.As a starter, we turn to links across Loch Fyne, and the Inveraray-St Catherines ferry.Based on information by Donald MacKechnieFrom the Middle Ages until 1963 a ferry sailed between Inveraray and St Catherines \u0026#8211 one of seven similar services up and down Loch Fyne linking Cowal and Mid Argyll. Before the roads were made these were important links- the sea unites and the land divides.Arguably the most important ferry followed the Inveraray \u0026#8211 St Catherines route, connecting with coach services to Loch Goil and the onward steamer to Greenock or Glasgow.At one time a large sailing boat carried horses and cattle. A rowing or sailing yawl conveyed pilgrims, pedlars, travellers and soldiers. Pilgrims and blind persons were carried free.From the 17th Century the ferry and ferryman\u0026#8217s house were auctioned annually by Inveraray Town Council to the highest bidder, with the burgh providing the two vessels. The ferryman kept the fares, and part of the deal was that the minister and magistrates would travel free of charge.When Inveraray new town was built in the 18th Century the Ferry Land housed the ferrier, who supplemented his income by running a dram shop. The Ferry Inn was a popular pub until 1917, when its licence was revoked.In 1827 David Napier, later a famous shipbuilder, introduced two steamers, the Thalia and Robert Bruce, from Inveraray to St Catherines and other ports on Loch Fyne. In 1836 the Lochgoil and Loch Long Steamboat Company became tenants of the ferry with a small paddle steamer, though the rowing/sailing boats were still available for a lower fare.From St Catherines their horse-drawn coach conveyed passengers to Lochgoilhead, from where they joined a steamer to the central belt.In 1856 the company introduced a new steamer, the Argyle. She was not a success, with author Alexander Smith describing her as \u0026#8216a small wash-tub of a steamer that carries you across Loch Fyne in an hour\u0026#8217.In 1865 the Inveraray Ferry and Coach Company took over with their beautiful little steamer, the Fairy.The route did not pay, however, and in 1892 the town council set up the ferry as a municipal enterprise with Fairy II, a little steel paddle steamer. When to town council gave up running the service in 1909, Mr John Dewar continued until the Fairy II was wrecked in the great storm of November 1912.Thereafter there were a number of ferriers. James Douglas used a Loch Fyne skiff fitted with a motor and Hope MacArthur operated launches called the Happy Return and the Jean.The car and bus rendered the sea link unnecessary and the service ended in 1963.A winter trip across Loch Fyne is recorded in the following song, sung to the tune \u0026#8216Kitty of Lochgoil\u0026#8217. Here are some of the verses:The Fairy in the Fog\u0026#8216Twas in the year of \u0026#821781On Januar\u0026#8217 the fourth dayThe steamer Fairy crossed Loch FyneTo Sweet St Catherines bay.Our Captain Bold was Duncan BellOur pilot Donuil DhuThe engineer Shon GilliesAnd Dugal Piobair was the crew.The passengers were soon aboardThat Coachy Jock had broughtAnd then again through blinding fogOur homeward way we sought.The day with fog was thick and darkYou could neither hear nor seeBut Donuil Dhu just kept her noseStraight from St Catherines quay.The pilot at his stemmy postStood firm as any rockThe compass true before his eyesJust like my grandfather clockAs we came near the Newtown bay.Our reckoning scarce could failSaid Dougal Piobair to himself\u0026#8216I wish we saw the jail\u0026#8217.The captain stood upon the deckA few feet from the funnelAnd to the pilot passed the word\u0026#8216Keep clear of Mackenzie\u0026#8217s tunnel\u0026#8217.Already we were sheering offOur course we knew quite wellWhen through the fog some lengths awayThere came a dismal yell.\u0026#8216Now what was that?\u0026#8217 the captain cried\u0026#8216I ne\u0026#8217er heard the like before\u0026#8217Said Dugal Piobair: \u0026#8216Sure it is a Pochkan on the shore\u0026#8217.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"food music and fun at tayvallich weekend gala","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/08/18, 7:01 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTayvallich was the place to be last weekend when the annual village gala was celebrated in style.The Tayvallich Weekend is the main fundraiser for Tayvallich Village Hall, which is preparing for a major redevelopment.The festivities kicked off on Friday evening with a barbecue at the Tayvallich Inn. This was a chance for villagers and visitors to get together to share food and drink, with musical entertainment from Paisley singer/songwriter Alan McKim.A wet start to Saturday July 28 failed to deter the enthusiasm of the crowds who converged on Tayvallich Village Hall for fun activities such as children’s sports, a bouncy castle and a pop-up crazy golf course that kept adults and children amused. The marquees provided shelter from the showers and a chance to browse the stalls.As well as classics like the bottle stall and guess the weight of the cake, there were representations from local businesses, voluntary groups and organisations, including the RNLI, Friends of the Sound of Jura, Heart of Argyll Wildlife and the 19th Argyll Scouts.After a break for lunch of paella, barbecue, sandwiches and home baking, the sun came out in time for the fabulous dog show, which featured novelty classes such as best six legs, fancy dress and the dog and handler race.Events moved into the hall on Saturday evening for the family ceilidh, where the fantastic Argyll Ceilidh Trail band kept the dancers on their feet into Sunday morning. The morning after, the focus moved to Tayvallich village pontoon for the world crab fishing championship.There are now 12 months of peace for people, pooches and partan until the next Tayvallich Weekend on July 26-28 next year.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"soaked campbeltown cyclist raised charity cash","story":"\t\tMark DaveyUpdated: 08/08/18, 8:30 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA Campbeltown cyclist joined an Argyll peloton for this year’s RideLondon 100 event.The eight-week London heat wave came to an abrupt end just in time for the cycling quartet to take to the roads.Campbeltown’s Marjorie Leighton had enthused so much after taking part last year, that she encouraged three Mid Argyll friend, Morag MacNicol, Catriona Crawford and Iain MacNicol, to participate in this year’s challenge.The day before the event the air temperature had soared to 32°C and the cyclists prepared for the possibilty of heat exhaustion.However on the day, they were shocked to find that they should have perhaps brought cyling capes instead.The persistent rain combined with the wind ensured that they were all soaked to the skin at the finish.The Argyll cyclists beat the target required for their chosen charity, Bloodwise (formerly Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research) which helps to fund research for specific types of cancer.This charity was selected, due to each of the participants having some experience with cancer.

Wages were 45p/hour and the telephone bill was £32.\u0026#8217Mrs Coats reflected on those early days: \u0026#8216I  could type, so I was asked to be the association secretary,\u0026#8217 she recalled modestly.The truth is, though, that her passion held Earra Gael together for decades with the help of many different volunteers in the shop.She continued: \u0026#8216Earra Gael is really a community. We have always had a good team. It was a lot of hard work, but very enjoyable.\u0026#8217One of the tasks shop staff were required to perform was to operate the weighbridge \u0026#8211 and this continued until 1987.There was more to running the association that selling pottery and weighing lorries, as Mrs Coats\u0026#8217 daughter Amanda remembers. \u0026#8216There was very little storage in the shop, so mum stored the stock at home.\u0026#8216Mum travelled all over to visit suppliers and she would set off on the bus in the morning and we never knew what she would come back with.\u0026#8217After running the shop for 20 years, Mrs Coats is taking a well-earned rest as Tarbert artist Wilma MacKenzie takes over the reins.Mrs Coats said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s nice to feel it is going to continue, slightly differently perhaps, but it\u0026#8217s going to continue.\u0026#8217PICS:Sarah Coats pictured outside the shop in the 1970s. no_a31EarraGael02Mrs Coats with her friend, Tarbert artist Ann Thomas who was one of the original members of the association in 1973. 08_a30GiftShopSarah02Members and volunteers at Earra Gael today.

Furious Pat Spence, plagued by ill-health she says is caused by the whirring windmills, revealed Scottish Power has failed to hand over data they promised. Now Pat says: “They’re not getting their machines back until they do what they said they would. “I want a legally binding agreement stating they will supply me with the information.” The 74-year-old is at the centre of a bitter battle with Scottish Power Renewables who have been circling her home near Barrhill with hundreds of giant wind turbines. We’ve been charting Pat’s plight since last March.  The flautist and music publisher says bad vibrations makes her sick and sleep-deprived. And she says that the 19th century Dochroyle hill farm steading she has lived in for more than 30 years has changed from “dream home to torture chamber.” On one occasion she was forced into sleeping in her car in the village. The turbine blades fire infrasound waves towards her home and Pat says the alien rhythm interferes with her body’s natural rhythm. As a result she says she feels like it’s a cross between a heart attack and a panic attack and due to balance being connected to hearing, that’s what is making her sick. She simply wants the power company to buy her out. Her case has been backed by scientists and medics and she was visited again last week by retired GP and occupational physician Angela Shiells. Dr Shiells said: “I have an interest in the ill-effects of wind turbines and have been studying Pat’s case for a year.  “I have no doubt that her symptoms are related to the turbines surrounding her home.” Pat suspects the power firm have been unable to devise a method of analysis of low frequency sound despite international expert Professor Mariana Alves-Pereira being able to. She said: “Scottish Power say they would not allow the data to be released to me because Mariana would twist it. How dare they accuse her of such malpractice. All I want is my life back.” She fears large extensions are being planned for the Kilgallioch wind farm as well as the doubling in size of Arecleoch and Mark. A Scottish Power spokeswoman said: “We installed monitoring equipment in Ms Spence’s home over a year ago in response to a complaint made regarding noise. A specialist consultant is currently analysing the data on our behalf, in accordance with a protocol agreed with South Ayrshire Council and in relation to the concerns raised by Ms Spence. “This assessment and accompanying data will be shared with both South Ayrshire Council and Ms Spence in due course. “In the meantime we do require access to recover our specialist consultant’s equipment and hope Ms Spence will allow us to do so.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rolling back years troon class","story":"NewsRolling back the years for Troon class of \u002798Marr College pupils reunite for great hotel partyShare\u0026nbspByStephen Houston13:39, 8 AUG 2018Updated13:40, 8 AUG 2018NewsParty girls They loved catching up (Image: Lynda McFarlane)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMore than 50 partying pupils rolled back the years to live life like it was 1998. Former pupils from Marr College took to the dance floor at the Marine Hotel last Saturday night to celebrate their 20-year reunion – those who would have started at the Troon school in 1992. There was lots of great banter, reminiscent 90s music and some interesting moves on the dancefloor. People had been sending old photos of themselves from back in the day which was collated into a slideshow. This ran throughout the night, showing that some people had hardly changed at all! Former pupils travelled from all over Scotland to meet old friends, some even came from England, America and as far a Hong Kong to join in the fun. It was a great night enjoyed by all those in attendance. A glass was raised to those from the year group who are no longer here and a “just giving” page was created for donations to be made to Cancer Research and the British Heart Foundation in their memory. DJ Steven James, was one of the pupils from the year group and did a great job spinning the decks and taking everyone back two decades. The event was staged by the now Lynda McFarlane, Mhairi Lammie (Miller) and Vicki Cameron. Mhairi said: “Several months of planning by a small dedicated group of former pupils paid off spectacularly. “My only complaint is that the evening was over all too quickly.” Ben Glasgow added: “It was fantastic meeting up with so many people from our year group in the same room at the one time. “The dancefloor and bar did very brisk business.” DJ Steven James summed it up when he said: “It was slightly surreal looking out at a dance floor full of people that I hadn’t seen in such a long time. “By the end of the night, I felt like any barriers or negative preconceptions had been broken down. It’s amazing what a little progressive samba (and alcohol) can do.” Do you have a human interest story that you would like to feature in the Ayrshire Post then give us a call on 01292 294463Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonSchoolsUniversities and CollegesEducationAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"disruption-expected-as-resurfacing-starts-on-earlston-high-street","story":"MOTORISTS in Earlston can expect disruption from tomorrow as a major resurfacing programme begins.\nThe works on the section of the A6105 road will take place for eight days from Wednesday, August 1, to Friday, August 10, with the route fully open on Saturday and Sunday.\nPhase one will see a section of the eastern end of the High Street closed for three days from 8.30am to 5pm.\nAnd phase two will be carried out using a convoy system from next Monday to Friday between 8.30am and 5pm.\nThe official diversion is via the A68, B6362, A697, A6089 and A6105 for eastbound, with the reverse route for westbound traffic.\nParking restrictions will also be in place on the High Street during the works from 8am to 5pm.\nCouncillor Gordon Edgar, Executive Member for Roads and Infrastructure, said: \u0026ldquoEarlston High Street is an important route not just for local residents and businesses but as the A6105 is one of the main roads from the west to the east through the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoThis resurfacing programme will vastly improve the road in Earlston, and with only a short-term daytime closure required.\n\u0026ldquoAll road users are asked to follow signed diversions during the three day closure, and allow themselves some extra journey time throughout the works.\nBus services will also be disrupted during the works.\nFrom tomorrow to Friday, service 60 will divert from Earlston bus stance via the A68 to Lauder, B6362, A697 to Greenlaw.\nService 60 from Greenlaw to Earlston will follow the same diversion.\nDuring this diversion a demand-responsive shuttle bus service will be provided by EAJ Robertson to connect with service 60 at both Earlston and Greenlaw for customers affected by the road closure.

arrived in the UK from their Southern Oregon mountain home.\nThe duo will play a string of dates including London, Cambridge and Maidenhead before heading to Scotland and Ireland next week.\nDani and Ian performed in their former years as a seven-piece folk orchestra called Patchy Sanders, which took them far and wide through the journey of songwriting and touring.\nAfter the folding of Patchy Sanders, the duo decided to take their love of songwriting and performing down to the bones, and used their acoustic instruments and voices to write the material for their first album, Hunter

transport you into their haunting and beguiling world of love tales and spine-tingling harmonies.\n\"They will have you travelling far and wide to hear them again.\nTheir first tour through Europe in 2016 brought them from Spain to Ireland\u0026mdash hitting small towns, far-reaching islands, and the greater metropolitan areas.\nTravelling with a nanny and Eowyn, their 5-year-old budding fiddler daughter, they played at cultural centres, pubs, and popular concert series.\nAnd the trip acted as a reconnaissance for the duo as they discovered their family history in Ireland and Scotland and began to collect the traditional songs of the people.\nThis spark of song collecting re-inspired their love of storytelling and performing intimate, acoustic concerts and infiltrated their repertoire of original songs with a smattering of uniquely interpreted traditional songs.\nFellow Pynins\u0026rsquo music employs the sounds of the mandolin, banjo, guitar, bouzouki and their voices in harmony to tell the stories of this human existence.\nThey will be touring through the UK and Ireland, playing 26 concerts in August, once again collecting lesser known traditional songs and gracing the stages from Cambridge Folk Festival to the mystical island of Iona.\nOn Friday, August 17 they will play at The Haining House in Selkirk from 8pm.\nTickets\n, priced at \u0026pound12.50, are available

An inn sprang up here known as the Brighous Inn and it was at this site that the famous Linton markets were first held.\nRobert Burns would visit Linton where he had a friend named Graham, the innkeeper at the Brighous. Twice he came but didn\u0026rsquot find his friend at home, so he scratched these words on a window pane of the inn: \u0026ldquoHonest Graham, aye the same, never to be found at hame.\nThe old inn was considerably enlarged in 1862, becoming Medwyn House, the home of William Forbes, a great benefactor of the village, who spent large sums in draining and improving the land. A new turnpike road between Carlops and Dolphinton had been built in 1831, and, as a result, a way-side inn appeared on the east side of the road called Rutherford Castle Inn.\nThe owner, James Greig, considerably improved the property and transformed the inn, which faced west, into the present dwelling house which faces south and is approached by an avenue from the main road.\nA later owner, Andrew Webster, extended the planting and enclosed a mineral spring, \u0026ldquoHeaven Aqua, less than two miles from Carlops.\nNot all the fine local houses around West Linton survived. Coldcoat or Macbiehill was one. It had a long pedigree, being built about 1600, but was demolished about 1950.\nIt was owned by the Hamiltons of Coldcoat and Grange the last of the Hamiltons being Alexander who died in 1697. Before he died he managed to repair the house and in so doing contrived that there were exactly 15 sleeping places in the house, so that he might have it in his power to accommodate the whole of the 15 judges of the Court of Session without the necessity of putting two in one bed.\nThe Coldcoat estate was then acquired by William Montgomery of Magbiehill in Ayrshire, who transferred this name which later became Macbiehill. Three of this family are buried in a mausoleum on the estate.\nAnother house that did not survive was Broomlee House. It was originally the manor house of Broomlee estate until it was acquired by Sir William Fergusson and absorbed into Spitalhaugh estate. After his death it continued to be occupied by his three spinster daughters until after their deaths when it was demolished and became part of the grounds of Broomlee Camp. During their lifetime the sisters were very active in the village and did good work.

system in the Note 9 will use artificial intelligence to help users take better photos, including scene recognition to automatically reset camera settings to ensure the best image is taken.\nThe camera will also alert users if it detects a blur in a photo so they can quickly retake it.\n(Samsung)\nIt features the same Dual Aperture technology Samsung introduced earlier this year on its Galaxy

transferred over from House of Fraser to Sports Direct.\nThe deal was struck through a pre-pack administration process, where a company is put into administration before a new buyer cherry picks the best assets.\nThe tycoon beat off competition from retail rival Philip Day, the billionaire owner of Edinburgh Woollen Mill.\nIt is understood that Mr Day\u0026rsquos proposal was in excess of

outlets and rebrand others under the Flannels fascia.\nPrior to its collapse, Mr Ashley had held an 11% stake in the department store chain.\nThe deal will see the Newcastle United owner tighten his grip over the British high street, adding to his sports retailing and \u0026ldquopremium fashion empire.\nThe billionaire has also built up stakes in rivals such as Debenhams, Goals Soccer Centres and

a 51% stake in House of Fraser and plough \u0026pound70 million into the ailing retailer, but then scrapped the move.\nLike other retailers, House of Fraser has been stung by soaring costs and falling

her eight-hour Emirates Airline flight to Dubai from London, a statement from the group said.\nShe was taken into custody after an immigration official questioned her about her visa and asked if she had consumed alcohol.\nBibi Holman had to go to the toilet on the cell floor, her mother said (Detained in Dubai/PA)\nMs Holman and her daughter were initially denied food, water and access to a toilet when they were held in a cell together for three days, the group claims.\nShe now faces being detained in Dubai for up to a year while awaiting a court hearing.\nThe group said she and Bibi

consumption \u0026ndash which she admitted.\nShe filmed him on her phone as evidence of his behaviour before learning this was an offence, and that it was illegal to drink alcohol, according to the

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

And he claimed his attempts to repair his stricken vessel were scuppered by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), which denied him permission to move to nearby Cockenzie Harbour to carry out the work.  Mr Ramsay, who is from West Yorkshire, told the Courier: \"I think it is a disgrace that East Lothian has no contingency plan for shipwrecks despite being a fishing community.  \"I have been threatened and abused while staying at the beach at Prestonpans with my boat and when I managed to float it and asked for permission to move to Cockenzie Harbour I was refused by the MCA.  \"I\u0027ve lost everything, this was my home and I invested everything in it.

The announcement comes after another incident at the park saw goalposts broken and scorch marks left on the 3G and 2G pitches.  The park, which is home to various football teams, has been the victim of numerous attacks but the latest, earlier this month, led to calls on social media for security to be tightened up there.  Two summers ago the park was hit twice by vandals in two weeks, again during July, with the \u0026lsquopie hut\u0026rsquo broken into and items stolen, as well as damage caused to the pitches and surrounding area.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoBoth the council and enjoyleisure are in talks about the possibility of introducing CCTV at Foresters Park so a decision will be taken on that in due course and local councillors will be kept updated.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that Foresters Park has unfortunately suffered some vandalism so the council\u0026rsquos Safer Communities Team continues to ensure that patrols cover the area regularly.  Earlier this month it was claimed on social media that young female players had been subjected to harassment from males as they trained at the park however, no formal complaints about any incident have been made to the council or police.  A council spokesperson added: \u0026ldquoWhile we are aware of vandalism issues, we have not been made aware of allegations of female players being harassed during training.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

A report presented to East Lothian Licensing Board as a tool to help it set its policy placed East Lothian as 18th out of 30 local authorities for alcohol availability, but that figure rose to 13th out of 30 for number of on-sales and fell to 21st out of 30 for number of off-sales.  It also found that alcohol-related death rates were four times higher in neighbourhoods with the most outlets when compared to areas with the fewest in the county and crime rates were also two-and-a-half-times higher.  However, it also revealed that, in general, the county performed far better than Scotland\u0026rsquos national average when it came to alcohol-related health harm and crime.

The proposal to turn the library, which as built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0027s Aldhammer House, were first put to the public in June 2016.  But they were criticised by Prestonpans Community Council, which said merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation the local authority announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year stating \"the majority of respondents said that they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the Library building.\"  However the council has now said that following a service review\u0026nbspit will move a wide range of services into the library from Monday, August 27.  Housing services will continue to be dealt\u0026nbspwith at Aldhammer House.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \"As more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.\u0026nbsp  \"Meanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint Library/Area Office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.\""},{"url":null,"title":"chernobyl-children-enjoy-a-special-pets-experience","story":"  The Ormiston-based organisation has been working with the Chernobyl Children\u0026rsquos Lifeline Trust and Swiis Foster Care to provide youngsters from Belarus with a special workshop as they visited the UK as part of a month-long recuperative holiday provided each year.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company was considering a number of sites with Prestonpans Community Councillor Calum Miller suggesting the former\u0026nbspCockenzie Power Station site could be\u0026nbspa possible home for it or\u0026nbsped that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe would always be interested in finding out more about projects which have the potential to grow the local economy and support jobs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8153016.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"a-host-of-local-acts-to-perform-at-fringe-by-the-sea","story":"  An array of entertainment is on offer during the festival, which this year celebrates its 10th anniversary with a bumper 10-day programme of events.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed.

As well as the new smartphone, Samsung also confirmed its new smartwatch \u0026ndash the Galaxy Watch \u0026ndash and previewed a smart speaker to rival the likes of the Amazon Echo and Apple\u0026rsquos HomePod, Galaxy Home.  The speaker will house Samsung\u0026rsquos artificial intelligence-powered virtual assistant Bixby, but does not yet have a confirmed release date.  In a gaming coup for Samsung, Fortnite maker Epic Games also made an appearance during the announcement in New York to confirm the popular battle royale game will launch in beta on the Android mobile operating system for the first time this week.  The rollout will begin with Samsung Galaxy devices from today, Epic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney said, adding that 125 million people were already playing the 100-player battle game.  Samsung said the camera system in the Note 9 will use artificial intelligence to help users take better photos, including scene recognition to automatically reset camera settings to ensure the best image is taken.  The camera will also alert users if it detects a blur in a photo so they can quickly retake it.  It features the same Dual Aperture technology Samsung introduced earlier this year on its Galaxy S9 range, which adjusts the camera lens to light in the same way as the human eye.  Mobile phone expert Ru Bhikha, from uSwitch, said the Note 9 was an impressive device, but its high price could deter some potential customers.  \u0026ldquoSamsung has really doubled down on the productivity aspects of the Note range and has pulled out all the stops to make the Note 9 especially appealing to people who live and work on the go, he said.  \u0026ldquoThe ability to connect to a desktop and keyboard through the DeX software is a useful flourish aimed at making this handset more versatile than any of its peers, but only if people actually use it.  \u0026ldquoThis is an impressive handset aimed at power users, rather than customers just craving a bigger screen, and the price point reflects that.  \u0026ldquoIt will be interesting to see whether Samsung\u0026rsquos beefiest ever price tag will act as a deterrent to potential new converts despite the increased storage and extended battery life \u0026ndash especially as mobile users are increasingly looking for the flexibility offered by SIM-only contracts."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8185467.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"house-of-fraser-bought-by-mike-ashleys-sports-direct","story":"  In a stock market announcement, Sports Direct said it has acquired all of the UK stores of House of Fraser, the brand and all of the stock in the business.  Some 17,000 staff are being informed that they will be transferred over from House of Fraser to Sports Direct.  The deal was struck through a pre-pack administration process, where a company is put into administration before a new buyer cherry picks the best assets.  The tycoon beat off competition from retail rival Philip Day, the billionaire owner of Edinburgh Woollen Mill.  It is understood that Mr Day\u0026rsquos proposal was in excess of \u0026pound100 million, would have avoided an administration and included House of Fraser\u0026rsquos pension scheme.  However, accountancy giant EY, which was overseeing the process, opted for Mr Ashley\u0026rsquos offer.  Sources said that Mr Ashley will now begin the process of turning some House of Fraser stores into Sports Direct outlets and rebrand others under the Flannels fascia.  Prior to its collapse, Mr Ashley had held an 11% stake in the department store chain.  The deal will see the Newcastle United owner tighten his grip over the British high street, adding to his sports retailing and \u0026ldquopremium fashion empire.  The billionaire has also built up stakes in rivals such as Debenhams, Goals Soccer Centres and French Connection.

C.banner was planning to buy a 51% stake in House of Fraser and plough \u0026pound70 million into the ailing retailer, but then scrapped the move.

The non-governmental organisation (NGO) formed to help people held in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) said it is representing the woman and her daughter Bibi, who was \u0026ldquoterrified by the experience.  The 44-year-old was arrested on July 13 after having one glass of wine on her eight-hour Emirates Airline flight to Dubai from London, a statement from the group said.  She was taken into custody after an immigration official questioned her about her visa and asked if she had consumed alcohol.  Ms Holman and her daughter were initially denied food, water and access to a toilet when they were held in a cell together for three days, the group claims.  She now faces being detained in Dubai for up to a year while awaiting a court hearing.  The group said she and Bibi were travelling to Dubai for a five-day break to visit friends, having visited a number of times before.  After landing she was questioned by an immigration official, who said her visa was invalid and she must return to London immediately, the group said.  Ms Holman claims he was \u0026ldquodismissive and rude when she asked if she could buy another visa, and was then questioned about her alcohol consumption \u0026ndash which she admitted.  She filmed him on her phone as evidence of his behaviour before learning this was an offence, and that it was illegal to drink alcohol, according to the group.  The pair were taken into custody with phones and passports confiscated before Ms Holman was asked to give a blood sample to test for alcohol consumption. She is said to have been refused the chance to phone her partner and was then held in a cell.  The UAE maintains a deliberately misleading facade that alcohol consumption is perfectly legal for visitors  It a statement from the group, Ms Holman claims the guards tried to rip out her hair extensions and described the prison as hot and \u0026ldquofoul smelling. She said the pair were made to sleep on a \u0026ldquofilthy mattress and she was told to clean toilets and floors.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy little girl had to go to the toilet on the cell floor. I have never heard her cry in the same way as she did in that cell.  \u0026ldquoThe food (we were given) smelled like rotting garbage and neither Bibi or I could face trying it. I stayed awake for the whole three days.  \u0026ldquoBy now, Gary knew something was wrong and had flown to Dubai to look for me. Friends had found out I was in jail and tried to visit. Nobody was allowed to see us. We were not even told.  She was released on bail and told her passport has been confiscated until the case is concluded. She said she has lost more than \u0026pound30,000 in legal fees and missed work.  Ms Holman is now spending time with her other children Suri, nine, and Noah, eight, who have flown out to Dubai to see her while Gary returns home with Bibi.  Radha Stirling, chief executive of Detained in Dubai, said: \u0026ldquoThe UAE maintains a deliberately misleading facade that alcohol consumption is perfectly legal for visitors.  \u0026ldquoTourists cannot be blamed for believing that the Emirates are tolerant of Western drinking habits, but this is far from reality.  \u0026ldquoIt is wholly illegal for any tourist to have any level of alcohol in their blood, even if consumed in flight and provided by Dubai\u0026rsquos own airline. It is illegal to consume alcohol at a bar, a hotel and a restaurant and if breathalysed, that person will be jailed.

He said: \u0026ldquoThis \u0026pound500,000 investment will build on the enthusiasm generated by Glasgow 2018, making a lasting difference in communities throughout the country, with a positive impact on the health of individuals while boosting community cohesion.  \u0026ldquoWhitacres Community Sport Hub is a perfect example of this. In particular, I\u0026rsquove been impressed by their boxing programme, which has achieved great success with women and older people.  Meanwhile, the games are also encouraging the city to take interest in an entirely new sport \u0026ndash golf.  As the only new event in the programme at Glasgow 2018, the historic event at Gleneagles is proving popular with fans, and those who can\u0026rsquot make it along in person are gathering in George Square and Glasgow Green to watch the action unfold.  Legendary Open champion Paul Lawrie will visit the championships today, to offer some tips to fans will taking part in a host of fun-filled golfing challenges in the spectator village.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe European Golf Team Championships are a hugely innovative and exciting format, especially as they are providing a historic moment for equality in sport with men and women competing together in the Mixed Team event on Saturday.  \u0026ldquoGolf events provide a terrific day out for the family with something to keep everyone interested. I hope that people will be inspired by watching some great players perform on the course before having the opportunity to try it for themselves in the spectator village.  Newly-crowned British Open Champion Georgia Hall and 2019 Solheim Cup Team Europe captain Catriona Matthew will also be popping by the course this weekend.

It brings the number of staff who have been made redundant at the Greenock-based company to 49.  The business, which has been providing freshly baked products to Scots ever since its founder opened his first store nearly 120 years ago, has previously said competition from big supermarkets combined with increased costs of ingredients and distribution meant the business could not survive.    The latest closures come just two days after the Renfrew, Kilmarnock, Irvine and Ayr stores were shut down with the loss of 26 staff.  The liquidators have said the remaining 18 Thomas Auld \u0026amp Sons Limited stores across Scotland \"continue to trade\" while the provisional liquidators seek to sell some or all of the stores to \"enhance value for creditors and safeguard as many jobs as possible\".  Paul Dounis, RSM restructuring advisory partner and provisional liquidator said: \"Regrettably, we have had to close a further four stores to reduce losses which has resulted in a further 23 employees being made redundant. We are working with local and national organisations to support those employees to process claims as quickly as possible.  \"We would ask any parties with an interest in acquiring the business to get in touch with us as soon as possible.\"  The liquidation does not affect Aulds\u0027 bakery products which can still be bought from branches of Scotmid and other local convenience stores."},{"url":null,"title":"church-leaders-take-on-home-office-over-hostile-environment-immigration-policy","story":"  The Church of Scotland is among 19 representative of churches across the UK who have written to the Home Secretary, calling for an end to policies which leave those who fall foul of Home Office rules without any means of support.  The Rev Dr Richard Frater, convener of the Kirk\u0027s Churhc and Society Council, was one of the signatories to the letter which demands the policies are dropped and claim destitution deliberately inflicted by the UK Government is \u0026ldquoinhumane and leads to racial discrimination.  The policy has seen members of the Windrush generation of West Indian immigrants told to leave the country because they lacked official documentation, provoked a row over the planned eviction of hundreds of would-be refugees in Glasgow and complaints from the director of the leaders of Edinburgh\u0027s international festivals over heavy-handed treatment of visiting artists under Home Office Rules.  In an open letter to Home Secretary Sajid Javid, the churches describe the \"hostile environment\" as a web of government policies designed to make life so difficult for people who cannot prove they have the right to live in the UK that they will choose to leave. Theywarn the system is inhumane,unjust, and is causing racist discrimination.  The letter calls fror a full independent review of the immigration rules and how they are being enforced. It states: \"We believe it is inhumane to usedestituition or the treat of destitution as a policy tool to encourage people to leave the country.\"  It continues: \"\u0026ldquoPeople who do not look or sound \u0026lsquoBritish\u0026rsquo are now facing increased difficulty in finding homes and employment, because landlords and employers are being asked to play the role of border guards.

The letter calls on the home secretary \u0026ldquoto seize this opportunity and adopt an approach to immigration that treats every individual, whatever their status, with humanity, dignity, respect and fairness. and adds: \u0026ldquoAs Christians we assert the importance of offering welcome to the stranger and caring for the vulnerable, whoever they are.

Ms Sturgeon is due to update Holyrood on her plans for a referendum in October.  Last year, after resetting her original plans after SNP general election losses, she said she would set out a \u0026ldquoprecise timetable in the autumn.  However with continued confusion over the terms of Brexit and potential delays in talks, she admitted this week that she didn\u0026rsquot know what she would say.  Speaking to the BBC in Aberdeen, Mr Wheelhouse was asked about the likelihood of a second referendum being called in the current circumstances.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe First Minister said she will review the situation in October.  \u0026ldquoClearly, the chances of that happening are higher the more the UK government pushes us down a line of no deal and cutting our ties to\u0026hellip the European single market.  \u0026ldquoPeople who are not necessarily sympathetic to the SNP are increasingly angry with the position the UK government has taken and the risk of a \u0026lsquono deal\u0026rsquo is focusing people\u0027s minds on perhaps the better opportunities there may be through independence.\"  The pound rebounded on Thursday after a report EU leaders were mulling a compromise that would avoid a no-deal by letting the UK opt out of free movement, but stay in the single market for goods.  However the idea came with a big catch.  In return for the EU dropping its resistance to cherry picking parts of the single market, the UK would have to replicate all future EU rules on environment, customs and social protection.  As this would effectively prevent the UK \u0026ldquotaking back control, the trade-off is unlikely to be backed by Westminster, but it does at least suggest an openness to new thinking.  Meanwhile, Theresa May has been forced to reassure Conservative party members that her Chequers plan for a soft Brexit is not a sell-out to Brussels.  In a three-page letter addressing the \u0026ldquostrong feelings in the rank and file, the Prime Minister insisted her proposals were \u0026ldquoin no sense a concession to the EU.  However she also said Brexit \u0026ldquorequires pragmatism and compromise from both sides.  The exercise, estimated to have cost the Tory party around \u0026pound70,000, comes amid a grassroots backlash to the Chequers deal, which would see the UK maintain a common rule book with the EU on goods and agri-foods, but diverge on services and migration.  David Davis quit as Brexit Secretary and Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary after the plan was agreed last month, and it has been criticised by other Brexiters as a betrayal.  Mrs May admitted \u0026ldquoparty members have raised a number of questions about her plan for a bespoke deal, and she wanted to \u0026ldquoaddress them directly.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know that some people are concerned that this common rule book will stop us doing trade deals. I can assure you that this is not the case - and I would not be proposing it if it would.  She acknowledged a common rule book \u0026ldquowould mean we could not drop our regulatory standards for goods in new trade deals with other countries, but said the government didn\u0026rsquot want to do that anyway, as it wanted to \u0026ldquoprotect British consumers.  \u0026ldquoI am well aware of the strong feelings members of our Party have on this national issue.  In recent weeks, Downing Street has held briefing sessions for Tory branch chairs, with Mrs May taking part in a conference call Q\u0026ampA with association chairmen.  She insisted the UK would take back control of its money, laws and borders and begin \u0026ldquoan exciting new chapter in our nation\u0026rsquos history.  She rejected both the EU\u0026rsquos options, saying one would mean a separate status for Northern Ireland and \u0026ldquobreak up the UK, which was unacceptable to her as a \u0026ldquoproud Unionist.  She also said Norway-style membership of the European Economic Area would continue free movement, \u0026ldquovast annual payments and alignment with EU rules.  She said: \u0026ldquoI remain clear that no deal is better than a bad deal - and we are stepping up our \u0026lsquono deal\u0026rsquo preparations.  The letter was accompanied by a series of endorsements by senior Tories, including pro-Brexit cabinet members and Leave campaigner Ruth Davidson.  The Scottish Tory leader said the Chequers plan was a \u0026ldquosensible compromise approach."},{"url":null,"title":"belt-and-braces-approach-to-exams-increasingly-under-pressure","story":"  As they were developed, pupils were given the opportunity of studying internal coursework units which - if they passed them - would count towards a National 4 qualification if they failed the National 5 exam.  Teachers were always likely to promote the belt and braces approach, but this led to a significant increase in workload for both staff and pupils which was deemed unnecessary in many cases.  As a result, John Swinney, the Education Secretary, agreed to get rid of the fall-back option.  However, an unintended consequence was the later realisation the move meant some borderline pupils entered for National 5 courses could leave with nothing if they failed the exam.  As a result Mr Swinney had to reverse the decision, but did so as an interim measure and only in exceptional circumstances.  As the latest figures show, some 10,000 pupils were awarded National 4 as a result of the fall-back, with the SQA handling some 140,000 unit assessments.  It is clear from these figures that the \u0026lsquoexceptional circumstances\u0026rsquo instruction was comprehensively ignored.  What is more worrying is that a late deluge of unit entries meant the SQA could not carry out its usual verification procedures.  All interested parties agree that situation cannot be repeated next year with the SQA seeing a tougher deadline as one solution. For teaching unions the answer needs to be more radical with a scrapping of the fall-back position altogether.  What that would mean in practice is teachers, parents and pupils having to make a judgement about whether candidates are best suited to National 4 or National 5.  Unfortunately, National 4 has a reputation problem because it has no final exam and a review is taking place to establish how to make it more attractive.  The promotion of National 4 as a worthwhile qualification is more vital than ever to ensure more reform of the exam system delivers for pupils."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-experiencing-mass-movement-of-parents-seeking-gaelic-schools","story":"  Allan MacDonald, chair of B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig, the public body responsible for Gaelic, said there had been a \u0026ldquosignificant boost in the number of families interested in Gaelic education in towns and cities.  He said the language was experiencing a \u0026ldquoshift in emphasis away from its heartlands and towards the Central Belt as populations continue to plummet in Scotland\u0026rsquos most rural areas.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe numbers are growing in the cities and the bigger towns all the time. And that contrasts quite significantly with the economic situation \u0026ndash not just in the Western Isles, but in other areas of the Highlands as well.  It comes as a series of commitments aimed at boosting the strength of Gaelic were unveiled at a milestone meeting of public bodies chaired by Deputy First Minister John Swinney.  This includes plans to publish the first ever Gaelic tourism strategy this autumn to help bring visitors into contact with the language.  Officials also want to increase the number of school subjects which can be taught in Gaelic.  Mr MacDonald said the new plans represented a \u0026ldquomajor investment of time, energy and resources.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a recognition of the important of Gaelic language and culture to the tourism industry. In effect that\u0026rsquos also a recognition of the place of Gaelic in the economy of Scotland.  He said recent figures indicating the population of the Western Isles could plummet by as much as 14 per cent in the next 20 years were a \u0026ldquoreality check, but new plans sought to reverse the tide and strengthen Gaelic-speaking rural communities.  Mr Swinney said the Scottish Government had set out a \u0026ldquoclear mandate for the support of Gaelic.  He added: \u0026ldquoThis meeting shows that there are a variety of activities being undertaken by a wide range of public bodies across Scotland in support of the language and it is important that we capitalise upon this to move the agenda forward.  \u0026ldquoI am pleased that agreement has been made on these key commitments and I hope that we can all work together to develop further commitments in the coming months."},{"url":null,"title":"call-for-cap-on-scottish-university-places-to-be-lifted","story":"  Richard Leonard, the party\u0026rsquos leader, said the move would ensure sufficient places were available to all qualified students as universities seek to attract more pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Because university students in Scotland get free tuition the cap acts as a control on public spending.  There is no cap in England, but students pay fees of up to \u0026pound9,000 a year and leave university with significantly more debt.  Universities are currently facing targets to increase the number of students from the poorest backgrounds, but this inevitably means a squeeze on middle class pupils unless the cap is lifted.  Mr Leonard commended Edinburgh University for its use of the clearing system to widen access.  But he added: \u0026ldquoNow Scotland\u0026rsquos universities need support from the Scottish Government around the cap.  \u0026ldquoLabour would make the richest pay their fair share through tax to ensure that education is open to all, and that there are fewer barriers to university access.  A Scottish Government spokesman highlighted figures published earlier this week which show the number of Scots winning a place at university is at a record high.  The number of number of students attending university from the poorest backgrounds has also increased.  The spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThis is testament to the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos commitment to maintaining free university education for students from all backgrounds.  Scotland\u0026rsquos EU students and university staff also make a significant contribution to our economy, culture and society, and will remain an integral and valued part of our universities.  As in previous years Scottish universities such as Edinburgh and Glasgow now use the clearing system to attract students from the poorest postcodes.  The move has been welcomed in some quarters, but Lindsay Paterson, professor of education at Edinburgh University, said the postcode system could, perversely, open the door to middle class students.  He said: \u0026ldquoDisadvantaged young people not in an eligible postcode would be missed and the policy would enable many young people who are not deprived to use clearing."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/4033618.jpg?type=article-full","title":"bbc-switch-off-campaign-goes-viral-but-is-the-publicly-funded-broadcaster-really-biased","story":"  Allegations of biased journalism within the publicly funded broadcaster have been historically made on both the left and right of the political spectrum.  But on Thursday a new social media campaign fuelled by a body of Scottish nationalists to boycott the BBC went viral, prompting a fresh discussion over whether the state broadcaster is biased.  The #BBCSwitchOff campaign is being supported by those who believe that the broadcaster is biased.  A fresh wave of protests began at 6pm on Thursday when it was suggested people switch off the BBC.  It was the number one trended hashtag on Twitter on Thursday across the UK with BBCBias also in the top ten. It was a similar story in Glasgow and Edinburgh.    One of the reasons for the campaign was the belief in some quarters that Jeremy Corbyn and left-of-centre politics is not getting a fair hearing on the Beeb.  Many Corbyn supporters were up in arms over an image of the Labour leader on Newsnight in March which they felt had been altered to look \u0026lsquomore Russian\u0026rsquo.    It came hot on the heels of Labour moving to defend Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s comments claiming the BBC is biased towards \u0027Israel\u0027s right to exist\u0027.  The Labour leader made the comments to Iranian state TV channel Press TV in 2011, when he was a backbencher.  On Thursday it appeared the BBC changed a headline on its story about Wednesday night\u0026rsquos attacks on Israel after the Board of Deputies angrily complained about its \u0026ldquoappalling stance on the issue.    The BBC\u0026rsquos original headline was \u0026ldquoIsraeli air strikes \u0026lsquokill woman and toddler\u0026rsquo, with no mention of the rocket attacks which came before the strikes.  On Thursday morning, the Board of Deputies tweeted: \u0026ldquoAppalling @BBCNews headline after Israel responded to *150* rockets fired at its towns by terrorists while families were asleep. We have complained and you should too, including a link to the BBC complaints page.      I truly thought the #BBCswitchoff was a Scottish thing....nice to see the rest of the UK has awoken to what we\u0027ve put up with for years....and nobody believed us back then.....      Will BBC report that #BBCswitchoff is trending at number one? We\u0027ll never know. #BBCswitchoff  The BBC subsequently changed its headline to \u0026ldquoGaza airstrikes \u0026lsquokill woman and child\u0026rsquo after rockets hit Israel.  The Board subsequently said this headline was \"better... but it\u0026rsquos still an inversion\".  \"Israel\u0026rsquos cities were struck by 150 rockets, sending tens of thousands in to shelters. Surely the headline should reflect this, it said.    A BBC spokesperson said: \"\u0026ldquoAlthough the original headline was not factually incorrect, we updated it to add more context to the story.  The Twitter\u0026nbspcampaign has been adopted by people outwith Labour activists, including a body of Scottish independence supporters.  Famously hundreds of Yes supporters held a demonstration outside BBC Scotland\u0027s headquarters over alleged bias in the network\u0027s coverage of the independence referendum in September, 2014.    And last week, the BBC moved to deny political bias after a pro-independence blogger criticised the public broadcaster after his YouTube channel was shut down in a copyright row.      wow not only is #BBCswitchoff number 1` now . its also the most tweeted in the last 4 hours and the 13th in the psast 24 hours . Well done guys keep it up.      Amused by #BBCswitchoff hashtag. We in Scotland have been mocked for complaining about warped @BBC reporting for years. #misreportingScotland @BBCScotlandNews  Stuart Campbell, who runs the Wings Over Scotland channel, claimed his channel was closed without warning after the publicly funded BBC complained about 13 videos that had been uploaded to it.  The channel of another prominent independence campaigner, Peter Curran, was also shut down after BBC copyright complaints.  Meanwhile it was demonstrated that the BBC had not taken similar action with other political sites that used its material.    The BBC halted its action while it reviewed its copyright enforcement responses and the channel was reinstated.  It was reinstated by YouTube while the BBC said it will review its actions.  While the organisation is required to provide impartial coverage, 40 per cent of people feel this isn\u0026rsquot the case \u0026ndash according to a poll in May by BMG Research.  BMG asked 1,005 British adults if they consider the BBC to be politically neutral, and just 37 per cent of them said they did.  But nobody can quite make up their mind why.      So here we go....people who are tired of #bbcbias get a chance to join the #BBCswitchoff tonight at 6pm starting with the @bbcnews. Judging by listening figures people have already turned off Humphrys @sarahsands100 \u0026amp @BBCr4today.

Always giving Tories the top jobs. No balance at all. They dont even try to hide it anymore.#BBCBias pic.twitter/qYzJYtVSNA  A combined 22 per cent of respondents felt it was either somewhat or strongly biased towards left-wing views, while 18 per cent felt it was somewhat or strongly biased towards the right. Nearly a quarter of people said they just didn\u0026rsquot know.    Last week the BBC withdrew an educational film about immigration following complaints that it was biased.  The film, aimed at GCSE pupils, contained claims that Britain was \u0027multicultural long before curry and carnival\u0027 and that debate over immigration had fuelled a \u0027huge rise\u0027 in support for far-Right politics.  It was pulled from circulation and removed from YouTube after complaints that it broke impartiality rules.  Last week it emerged BBC Radio 4\u0026rsquos flagship news and current affairs programme, Today, which for decades has set the agenda for the media-political elite, has been haemorrhaging listeners.    According to figures released by RAJAR, the official body for the monitoring of radio audiences, the programme has lost more than 800,000 listeners over the past year.      #BBCswitchoff The difference between the Boris coverage and the Corbyn coverage is a classic illustration of #bbcbias      Fight back against #BBCBias from 6 pm this evening :    1 Switch off the BBC at 6.    2.Join the Twitter storm about BBC Tory Propoganda bias    3.Always use the hashtag #BBCSwitchOff it\u0027s case sensitive. little people can change things too it\u0027s#BBCSwitchOff pic.twitter/aDz0ZZscgr  The BBC noted that audiences for news and current affairs programmes fluctuate over time, and suggested a \u0026ldquoquieter news agenda partly explained the drop-off.  But Tom Mills, a lecturer in sociology at Aston University and the author of The BBC: Myth of a Public Service says it may be because \"liberals and leftists have finally given up on the programme\".  Accusations of a left-wing bias were often made against the BBC by members of Margaret Thatcher\u0027s 1980s Conservative government.    Norman Tebbit called the BBC the Stateless Person\u0027s Broadcasting Corporation because of what he regarded as its unpatriotic and neutral coverage of the Falklands War, and Conservative MP Peter Bruinvels called it the Bolshevik Broadcasting Corporation.  Nine years ago, BBC director general, Greg Dyke, criticised the BBC as part of a \"Westminster conspiracy\" to maintain the British political system.  Nigel Farage has previously attacked the organisation for being too left-wing, and Leave voters accused Question Time of deliberately picking \u0026lsquoless intelligent Leavers\u0026rsquo for a TV audience last year.      Dear @BBCNews please explain to me how Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos outrageous and racist rhetoric is just \u0026ldquosilly language but despite Corbyn\u0026rsquos lifelong fight against racism, you are happy to basically compare him to Hitler? #BBCBias #boycott https://t.co/4pxY6Opexe  The BBC last month defended its Brexit coverage after being accused the corporation of \"journalistic cowardice\" in its reporting of the EU Referendum and its aftermath.  In response, James Stephenson, news editor at BBC News, said it had \u0026ldquoreported on every aspect of the [Brexit] story over the past two years.  He added: \u0026ldquoThere can be few times in the BBC\u0026rsquos history when its journalism has mattered more. This is not an organisation frightened of journalism, but committed to it.  BBC\u0027s Europe editor last year hit out at claims the broadcaster is biased against Brexit - claiming they have been blocked from holding European officials to the same standard they hold British officials to.    Speaking to BBC\u0027s News Watch programme, which monitors complaints about the broadcaster, Katja Adler, the BBC\u0027s Europe editor, addressed claims of spreading \"doom and gloom\".  Ms Adler, who is based in Brussels, said she understands viewers who see this perceived bias and complain the BBC unfairly portrays the British side of the talks.  She explained: \"It is a fair comment to make.  \"It is my job to put across the European perspective, which may come across anti-Brexit.  \"But this is all because, since the Brexit talks started, there has been silence enforced inside the EU Commission and among EU leaders, in order to only let Michel Barnier speak about Brexit.  \"We do not have the same access to talk to the same players as we do on the British side to put the difficult questions to them.  \"That can be very frustrating for our viewers, and it can seem like we are not doing our job, but the players just do not let us interview them on the record, so they end up being sources or insiders.\"  She said this led to the EU officials not being held to the same level of scrutiny as those in Britain, but insisted reporters in Brussels were trying their best to hold them to account.  The BBC were approached for comment on the Twitter campaign."},{"url":null,"title":"business-chiefs-urge-scrapping-of-immigration-targets-after-brexit","story":"  Businesses need a new immigration policy, avoiding visas for EU citizens and putting migration on the table for trade talks, according to its new report\u0026nbspOpen And Controlled \u0026ndash A New Approach To Migration.

Blue light, which has a shorter wavelength and more energy compared to other colours, can gradually cause damage to the eyes.  Dr Ajith Karunarathne, an assistant professor in the university\u0026rsquos Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, said: \u0026ldquoWe are being exposed to blue light continuously and the eye\u0026rsquos cornea and lens cannot block or reflect it.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos no secret that blue light harms our vision by damaging the eye\u0026rsquos retina.  \u0026ldquoOur experiments explain how this happens, and we hope this leads to therapies that slow macular degeneration, such as a new kind of eye drop.  Macular degeneration, which affects around 2.4% of the adult population in the UK, is a common condition among those in their 50s and 60s that results in significant vision loss.  It is caused by the death of photoreceptor, ie light-sensitive cells in the retina.  Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the US and while it does not cause total blindness, AMD can make everyday activities such as reading and recognising faces difficult.  Photoreceptor cells need molecules called retinal to sense light and trigger signalling to the brain, enabling us to see.  The researchers found that being exposed to blue light causes retinal to set a chain of reactions that leads to toxic chemical molecules to be created in the photoreceptor cells.  Kasun Ratnayake, a PhD student at the University of Toledo who was involved in the study, said: \u0026ldquoIf you shine blue light on retinal, the retinal kills photoreceptor cells as the signalling molecule on the membrane dissolves.  \u0026ldquoPhotoreceptor cells do not regenerate in the eye. When they\u0026rsquore dead, they\u0026rsquore dead for good.  The researchers found that introducing retinal molecules to other cell types in the body, such as cancer cells, heart cells and neurons, caused them to die off when exposed to blue light.  They also noticed that blue light alone or retinal without blue light had no effect on cell.  Dr Karunarathne said: \u0026ldquoThe retinal-generated toxicity by blue light is universal. It can kill any cell type.  The scientists found that a molecule called alpha tocopherol, a natural antioxidant found in the eye and body, stops the cells from dying but fails to offer any protection to the ageing population or those whose immune systems have been suppressed.  Dr Karunarathne said: \u0026ldquoThat is when the real damage occurs.  For those wanting to protect their eyes from blue light, Dr Karunarathne advises wearing sunglasses that can filter both UV and blue light outside and avoiding browsing on mobile phones or tablets in the dark.  The research is published in the journal Scientific Reports."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh-book-festival-undermined-by-visa-issues-says-nicola-sturgeon","story":"  The Scottish First Minister \u0026ndash a keen reader who is also taking part in the literary event \u0026ndash hit out after book festival director Nick Barley said some of the writers had been\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquohumiliated by the measures they had to go through to get permission to enter the country.

Based on similar, successful schemes in Paris and New York, the report says it would \"help citizens experience the city in a quieter, more people-focused environment\".

The future once looked so bright. A series of marquee acquisitions over a 50-year period in the middle of the 20th century saw the company\u0027s portfolio blossom, offering customers an everything-under-one-roof shopping experience that allowed people to browse for wedding gifts, homeware, beauty products and designer clothes, all within the same four walls.  It was a far cry from its humble beginnings as a small drapery shop in Glasgow in 1849, the brainchild of farmer\u0027s son Hugh Fraser and small business owner James Arthur.  The name Arthur \u0026amp Fraser was born, and could be found on the corner of Argyle Street and Buchanan Street in the Scottish city.  A century later, and after the wholesale business splintered from the retail side, the firm had grown to become a national chain known as House of Fraser.  It would go on to acquire numerous other businesses as its stores emerged bruised and bloodied but emboldened from the Second World War, from clothes broker Brown Muff \u0026amp Co in Yorkshire to Dingles drapery shop in Plymouth.  Harrods, too, would become part of the House of Fraser family in the late 1950s. Then, in 1985, the company was bought by Egyptian-born tycoon Mohamed Al Fayed and its profile soared further.  But trouble was afoot.  By January 1997, new chief executive John Coleman delivered on his promise to sell three stores - with the loss of 1,000 jobs - having been hit by a slump in the womenswear market and \"poor buying policies\".  A slight increase in sales the following year was not enough to drag the company into the black, and House of Fraser would go on to mortgage some retail estates to raise money for store revamps.  A further rise in like-for-like sales at the turn of the millennium gave cause for optimism, new store openings and the creation of hundreds of new jobs.  It would go on to acquire more regional chains, such as Jenners and Beatties, but the company\u0027s wheels had started to come off by the time it was bought by Chinese conglomerate Sanpower Group for nearly \u0026pound500 million in 2014.  The rise of discount stores such as Primark and Poundland, and the growth of internet shopping through sites such as Amazon, had already been credited as a contributory factor for hastening the demise of several high street staples.  Finally, after signalling that its future looked bleak, House of Fraser announced on Friday that it had fallen into administration, endangering the future of 17,000 staff.  As of June, the group had 59 locations across the UK and Ireland."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-duncan-smith-says-employers-have-not-bothered-to-look-at-british-workers","story":"  Speaking on Radio 4\u0026rsquos Today programme, the former work and pensions secretary blamed employers for not hiring British workers and dismissed business chiefs\u0026rsquo call for immigration targets to be scrapped after Brexit.

In the most recent sign of growing frustration between Washington and Pyongyang, North Korea criticised senior American officials for insisting that North Korea give up its nuclear weapons first before easing sanctions.  Notably, the statement did not directly criticise President Donald Trump, who met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June.  North Korea said in a statement on Thursday that \u0026ldquosome high-level officials within the US administration were making \u0026ldquodesperate attempts at intensifying the international sanctions and pressure.  \u0026ldquoWe hoped that these goodwill measures would contribute to breaking down the high barrier of mistrust between Pyongyang and Washington, the North\u0026rsquos Foreign Ministry spokesperson said.  \u0026ldquoHowever, the US responded to our expectation by inciting international sanctions and pressure.  Those American officials are \u0026ldquogoing against the intention of President Trump to advance the DPRK-US relations, who is expressing gratitude to our goodwill measures for implementing the DPRK-US joint statement, it said referring to the North by its official name, the Democratic People\u0026rsquos Republic of Korea.  Washington has said that sanctions will not be lifted until Pyongyang fully and finally dismantles its nuclear weapons.  Some experts say that North Korea does not want to denuclearise first or maybe denuclearise at all because it wants a long, drawn-out process that sees external aid shipped in in return for abandoning nuclear weapons.  Pyongyang has also stepped up its calls for a formal end to the Korean War, which some analysts believe is meant to be the first step in the North\u0026rsquos effort to eventually see all 28,500 US troops leave the Korean Peninsula.  A South Korean official at the Unification Ministry said the two Koreas will also discuss on Monday ways to push through tension-reducing agreements made during an earlier summit between Mr Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.  Among the agreements was holding another inter-Korean summit in the fall in Pyongyang.  The rival Koreas may try to seek a breakthrough amid what experts see as little progress on nuclear disarmaments between Pyongyang and Washington despite the Singapore summit in June and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u0026rsquos several visits to North Korea.  Pyongyang insisted that the US should reciprocate to the North\u0026rsquos suspension of missile launches and nuclear tests and other goodwill gestures such as the return of remains of American troops killed in the Korean War.  The United States cancelled a joint war exercise with South Korea that was due to take place this month while dismissing calls to ease sanctions until the North delivers on its commitments to fully denuclearise.  The inter-Korean meeting on Monday will be held at Tongilgak, a North Korean-controlled building in the border village of Panmunjom.  South Korea\u0026rsquos unification minister will lead the delegation from Seoul but North Korea, which proposed the Monday meeting first, did not confirm the makeup of its delegation.  It was not clear when another inter-Korean summit might happen, but if the April 27 summit agreements between Mr Moon and Mr Kim are followed through on, the leaders will likely meet in Pyongyang in the next couple of months.  In the meantime, both Koreas are seeking an end of the Korean War.  South Korea\u0026rsquos presidential spokesman said last month that Seoul wants a declaration of the end of the 1950-53 war sooner than later.  The Korean Peninsula is still technically in a state of war because the fighting ended with a ceasefire, not a peace treaty.  Earlier on Thursday, North Korea\u0026rsquos Rodong Sinmun said in a commentary that ending the Korean War is \u0026ldquothe first process for ensuring peace and security not only in the Korean peninsula but also in the region and the world.  Mr Kim and Mr Moon met in April at a highly publicised summit that saw the leaders hold hands and walk together across the border, and then again in a more informal summit in May, just weeks before Mr Kim met Mr Trump in Singapore."},{"url":null,"title":"information evening for potential teachers","story":"        Aberdeenshire Council is holding an information evening for anyone considering studying part-time to become a secondary school teacher.

While the teaching profession has come under much national scrutiny, it is heartening for teachers and other staff to see their hard work and unstinting support result in young people achieving thesuccess they deserve.                                                                                                        \"These results will hopefully give everyone a much deserved boost and allow us to continue this positive trend of exam results in Aberdeenshire.”The council continues to use the national ‘Insight’ tool to monitor attainment in schools throughout the year. Data from this year’s results is compared with the previous year using ‘legacy measures.’For a third straight year there were young people who achieved 5 ‘A’ grade passes at Higher level at every Aberdeenshire secondary school.The percentage of S6 pupils leaving with 5 or more Highers increased from 32% to 37% and at Advanced Higher level the number achieving an award remained a healthy 24%.                                                                                                        The number of S4 pupils who achieved 5 or more National 5 qualifications rose from 50.1% to 52.7%, an improvement of 2.6% compared with the previous year.Across Aberdeenshire around 6,000 pupils will receive their results in a range of levels, including National 2 to Advanced Higher, in a variety of 70 vocational and academic subjects from Accounting, Travel and Tourism, Dance, Design and Manufacture, and Fashion and Textile Technology.Furthermore, the latest figures show 96% of Aberdeenshire pupils continue their studies in either higher or further education or find employment.Pupils who need further help or information can call the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) candidate advice line on 0345 279 1000 whilst Skills Development Scotland is offering advice for those concerned about their career options on 0808 100 8000.

His comments came as Ms Sturgeon visited Turriff Show, Scotland’s second biggest agricultural event after the Royal Highland Show.                                                    Mr Chapman has written to Transport Scotland to seek clarity after local officials suggested that the bypass would be granted “special road” status, excluding agricultural vehicles.        The issue was highlighted by NFU Scotland during a round table discussion at the New Deer Show last month and farmers are concerned they will have difficulty transporting livestock, particularly those making the journey from Ellon to the other side of the city at Portlethen.Mr Chapman, who is also a farmer, said the situation also raises the question of increased greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural vehicles being forced to travel through the city.He said: “My view is that this road is not a motorway, it is a dual carriageway and therefore tractors should be permitted to travel along the route.“I have written to Transport Scotland, but I have yet to receive a response. I would urge Nicola Sturgeon to speak up on behalf of our local farmers so that common sense can prevail and this ill-thought ban is lifted.”                                                                                                        Local SNP MSP Gillian Martin said that a public consultation regarding the route had been carried out in 2007 although views can still be put to Transport Scotland.She added: “I believe the NFU Scotland did submit to that. It’s unclear whether a call for access to agricultural vehicles was included in their submission at that point.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Friday 10 Aug 2018 11:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116893.jpg","title":"Decision on Premier Inn to be made in September","story":"A DECISION on a budget hotel chain\u0026rsquos bid to build a three-storey complex on vacant land in Thurso is expected to be made next month.The proposal for a Premier Inn was originally criticised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce, but an avalanche of comments online appears to suggest a majority of people in the area would be behind the move.A Highland Council spokeswoman said the application will come up for consideration in September.\u0026ldquoBut there is a lot of outstanding information our planners are awaiting from the agent, she added.The application is to be decided by the council, but notice is taken of objections submitted to the planning authority \u0026ndash both in document form and online.According to the Highland Council\u0026rsquos website, just two documents objecting to the building of the hotel had been submitted to planning by the end of last week and one organisation was backing it.One of the objections is from the chamber of commerce, which claimed that the hotel would have \u0026ldquoa significant negative impact on other businesses and the town centre. Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds.

Then, despite repeated promises over the last year, ministers failed to reach an agreement that would allow Road Equivalent Tariff to be introduced on external ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“This has left people in Orkney angry and frustrated, not least as we see another tourism season come and go with no sign of the cheaper fares. Worse still, there has been no indication from the Scottish Government what steps it is taking to try to unlock this impasse.“The transport secretary must set out clearly what he has done and plans to do to reach a resolution. He must also reaffirm that any fare reductions will be backdated to the end of June this year as previously promised. The funding has been set aside and must benefit those using these lifeline services.“While Mr Matheson is new in post, he must treat this issue as a priority. He must know that the longer this shambles goes on, the worse it reflects on him and the government.”A Scottish Government spokesperson responded: “We remain committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles and are currently undertaking further work on the issue. As a first step, we have cut fares on the Aberdeen to Lerwick and Kirkwall to Lerwick services by around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They were both originally earmarked for closure, but were later given temporary reprieves to see if customer numbers increase.The new report also warned that while \"online banking, Post Office banking and mobile bank vans go some way to providing alternatives\", there were concerns over cyber security, \"the fragile nature of Post Office contracts\", and accessibility of mobile banks.Zoe Laird, HIE\u0026rsquos regional head of communities infrastructure, said: \"Along with the findings of the Scottish Parliament Enquiry into bank closures this [study] will inform how public sector agencies and service providers respond.\"Friday 10 Aug 2018 11:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The number of property viewings conducted by Galbraith in the Highlands has increased from 167 this time last year to 216 in 2018, a rise of 29 per cent.Increased demand has also seen the average time taken to sell property drop by 21 per cent since last year.Phiddy Robertson, who handles residential sales for Galbraith in Inverness, revealed that the average price of property sold from the firm\u0026rsquos Inverness office during the quarter rose 14.8 per cent from \u0026pound284,992 in the previous quarter to \u0026pound327,21\"The market has picked up significantly since 2015 and in 2018 the first six months show a steady increase in activity,\" she said.\"Demand for well-sited property remains high, with competition leading to more closing dates, most of which achieve significant premiums over the asking price, while there is also greater movement at the top end of the residential market.\"The region continues to be a draw for new residents moving in from outside the area.\"While prices are rising, the Highland area remains less expensive than many other parts of the UK and we see buyers from all over the country making the move here to enjoy a better quality of life,\" Ms Robertson added.The UK government House Price Index for May 2018 noted that the largest regional increase in sales by volume in Scotland was for the Highland region, where volumes increased by 3.9 per cent on the previous year.Currently on the market with Galbraith in Inverness are the following properties:The Galbraith letting department for Inverness also enjoyed a busy quarter.The number of relets agreed increased by 25 per cent compared with the previous quarter. Viewings also increased by five per cent for rental properties and the average time taken to find a tenant for a rental property was just six days.Sarah Hazzard, who manages lettings for Galbraith in Inverness, said: \"We find that both city-centre properties and well-presented cottages in rural areas are snapped up soon after becoming available.\"Landlords are able to increase the rents they charge between tenancies due to the very limited supply of rental property in Inverness-shire and the very strong demand from tenants.

The disastrous roll-out of universal credit that was piloted in the Highlands has resulted in vast swathes of unnecessary suffering.\"Folk, many of whom are working, are being driven into destitution and families are being left with no choice but to rely on foodbanks.\u0026nbsp\"These are political choices and it\u0026rsquos high time those in power in Westminster took responsibility for the unnecessary suffering they are causing to folk in the Highlands, and indeed across the UK.\"Ms Todd and fellow SNP MSP Kate Forbes have now opened up their office for use as a food drop-off point in a bid to encourage more Ross-shire residents to donate as organisations struggle to keep up with demand.The kind-hearted pair said constituents will be able to leave food parcels, containing non-perishable items including pasta, rice and coffee, at their office in Dingwall High Street.And they have teamed up with Blythswood Care, which runs the Highland foodbank network, in response to the news that the number of children using the Dingwall site has risen by more than 50 per cent. The facility has also been appealing for extra donations to meet demand.\"When we saw the recent plea for food bank donations, we thought this was something we could do to help,\" Ms Forbes said. \"For the first six months of the year, 40 children have received food parcels from the Dingwall food bank, which is more than a 50 per cent increase on the previous year. This is deeply concerning.\"Across the Highlands there is a 10 per cent year-on-year rise in the number of adults receiving food parcels, whilst the number is over 25 per cent for children.\"It\u0026rsquos a sign of the times that people are dependent on food donations in a rich country \u0026ndash and an indictment on welfare reform which has left people with no other choices.\"Although the total number of people across the Highlands and the number of children using food banks have both risen, the number of adults being referred to the Dingwall food bank has fallen.Blythswood Care\u0026rsquos projects manager Finlay Mackenzie spoke of his gratitude to the two MSPs for opening their office for donations.He believes families who normally receive additional support during the school term need more help during the summer holidays.He said: \"Sadly we see an increase in referrals to our food banks across the Highlands year on year.\"This summer there has been an even greater need with many families needing extra support who would usually receive free school meals and have children who attend breakfast clubs.\"Food donations usually drop during the summer but with media support we have been very encouraged by the generous donations by the public.\"We are very grateful for the support and involvement of Kate Forbes MSP and Maree Todd MSP whose backing helps to highlight the plight of local people in times of crisis.\"Friday 10 Aug 2018 11:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Sources said that Mr Ashley will now begin the process of turning some House of Fraser stores into Sports Direct outlets and rebrand others under the Flannels fascia.Prior to its collapse, Mr Ashley had held an 11% stake in the department store chain.Read more: House of Fraser announce closure date for store on Edinburgh’s Princes Street"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4781700.1533885105!/image/image.jpg","title":"richard leonard calls for review of cap on scottish students at universities","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        An overhaul of the \u0026#8220cap\u0026#8221 facing Scottish youngsters seeking a place at university has been called for by Labour leader Richard Leonard.                Students from other EU nations should no longer have their education funded at Scottish institutions after Brexit, Mr Leonard has said. The cash should instead used to provide more places for Scottish youngsters.            “A government that claims education is the priority should be raising the cap on student places,” Mr Leonard said ahead of a visit to Edinburgh University today.            “The SNP must also commit now to extend the cap post-Brexit.“Investing in education is vital for our long-term economy and society. Labour would make the richest pay their fair share to ensure that education is open to all, and that there are fewer barriers to university access.” The cap on Scottish students going to university north of the Border is in place as a result of the Scottish Government’s commitment to ensure free tuition for those who do attend. Numbers must be restricted or the commitment would become unaffordable and Mr Leonard is not suggesting it is abolished, but eased. No such cap applies south of the Border, where UK students pay fees of £9,000 a year.And although English, Welsh and Northern Irish students pay fees in Scotland, other EU students have their fees paid in line with current EU rules. Education Secretary John Swinney has so far indicated this will continue even after Brexit, but Mr Leonard says this will end and EU students will “fall out” of the cap.Universities say the capped system makes it harder for them to widen access to poorer students in line with Scottish Government directives.            A spokeswoman for Universities Scotland last night welcomed Mr Leonard’s intervention.“Taking action on the cap on numbers would be a welcome release on some of that pressure, provided that any additional places were fully funded,” she said.“It’s welcome Labour’s statement is so clear that any extra places would be fully-funded, using the resource that is currently invested in EU students but which is likely to be released post-Brexit. We’re actively having conversations around fully-funded student numbers with the Scottish Government as part of Brexit planning. The Government’s medium term financial strategy suggested that it was open to this too, as a route to wider access, but we’d welcome more explicit confirmation.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4781683.1533884724!/image/image.jpg","title":"edinburgh to introduce car free city centre zones once a month","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Edinburgh is to become the first place in Scotland to introduce city centre car-free zones once a month in a move that councillors believe will \u0026#8220leave a legacy\u0026#8221 for future generations.                The introduction of a pilot project that will see key roads closed to traffic on the first Sunday of every month between 10am and 5pm was agreed at a meeting of the city council’s transport committee yesterday.            No decision has been taken on which roads will be closed during the Open Streets programme, but they will include “key parts of the city centre and town centres” across the Capital.            There will also be an eight-week public consultation to help determine people’s views on plans to further restrict vehicles in the city centre.After the meeting, vice transport and environment convener, Karen Doran, said: “There’s no doubt that for many years the city has been crying out for change - it definitely needs it.“It’s a massive change, but it’s about what the citizens want and what they need. I’m incredibly proud and impressed. It will future-proof our city for generations to come.”Daisy Narayanan, project director of Open Streets, said the monthly traffic closures would “help us understand what happens” when parts of the city are shut off to vehicles.She said: “All these ideas have to be tested for when we come back with a more concrete package.            “Where we are today is hugely exciting and we are ready to go to the public with some bold and realistic ideas. This is something that’s essentially a trial that could allow people to get used to what the city could be like. It will be a legacy for future generations.”However some Conservative councillors voiced concerns and urged that a “more cautious and data-driven approach” should be taken.Yesterday’s meeting considered a prospectus for the establishment of a Low Emmission Zone (LEZ) that outlined three visions for the future of transport in Edinburgh, including one radical option which would see the city centre becoming ‘largely traffic free’.Other elements of the prospectus set out plans for the pedestrianisation of key streets and areas such as Edinburgh’s town centres - Corstorphine, Gorgie and Dalry, Leith and Leith Walk, Morningside and Bruntsfield, Nicolson Street and Clerk Street, Portobello, Stockbridge and Tollcross.            Scotland’s first pollution-reducing LEZ will be operating in Glasgow at the end of the year when motorists will be fined for entering the protected area in proscribed vehicles.Yesterday Green councillor, Chas Booth, welcomed the radical proposals, but urged the council to adopt a “hybrid approach” to the LEZ plans, so that areas outside the city centre are also included.He was supported by Liberal Democrat councillor Gillian Gloyer who raised concerns that drivers could resort to “dumping polluting vehicles on the periphery of the city” to escape punshment.The Conservatives voted against moving forward the plans for regular Open Streets days, citing a lack of evidence of road closures to air pollution levels.Councillor Nick Cook called for a “high level of public confidence” in the plans and an “assurance that this is what the public and businesses want”.            He said: “We are in a situation where we are using anecdotal evidence. We are putting forward a full programme without enough data. We need a more cautious and data-driven approach.”The council will bring forward proposals later in the year for which routes could be closed for the Open Streets project and widespread consultation will be held with interested parties.The first open Streets events could take place early next year.Transport and environment convener, Lesley Macinnes, said: “I’m immensely pleased that the committee has come together and recognised the need to take this next step.“This report is an opportunity to really engage with the people of Edinburgh over the future of how this city runs and how this city serves them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"we are underdogs in milne cup clash says shetland manager main ","story":"Shetland football team\u0026#8217s coaches Kevin Main (on left) and Robert Geddes at a training session at the Gilbertson Park last Wednesday.

I think if there’s any doubt in any competitor’s mind, that will show up a weakness.\n“So it’s important our guys feel confident and from the experience of Shetland inter-county matches before – of which me and [assistant manager] Robert [Geddes] have had a couple – we know that this team is capable of meeting the standard required to win.”\nHowever, Main is under no illusion about the scale of the challenge facing his side.\nHe said: “Orkney at this moment in time in my mind are clear favourites [due to] their home record over the last year, albeit in a different format – the North Caledonian competition.\n“In addition, two years ago we went with great confidence and unfortunately came away with a defeat so we know they are extremely strong and difficult on their home park.”\n *Eighteen players will be travelling but only 16 can be selected for the match.\nMeanwhile, hopes are high that the Shetland women’s hockey team can improve on their recent record against Orkney.\nThis year’s game will see Orkney attempt to record a 14th straight victory.\nShetland’s last success came via a penalty shoot-out after a 2-2 draw in 2003, but joint coaches Derek and Brenda Leask believe the team is close to finally turning the corner.\nDerek Leask said: “The team is well prepared and have been focusing on strength and speed work with weekly Sunday morning training sessions at the Factory Gym at Whiteness.\n“Dhanni Moar and his coach Bryan Pearson, devised a 12-week training programme to have the lasses in peak condition. The squad demonstrated great commitment in tuning up in large numbers to every session. The hockey team really appreciated Dhanni and Bryan giving up their time to help them perform to their best in this fixture.\n“It’s been a long time since Shetland won the cup in Orkney [1982] but despite the reds’ recent success the team is confident of pushing them all the way this year.\n“We’re really looking forward to putting on a competitive display and showing that there is a high standard of hockey in Shetland too.”\nHockey squad: Megan Nicholson (Spurs), Francesca MacColl (Delting) Janetta Williamson (Delting), Rhiannon Inkster (Spurs), Megan Hibbert (Delting) Vicky Wiseman (Burra), Nicola Balfour (Delting), Kristen Jeromson (Burra), Emma Michael (Spurs), Aimee Keith (Zetland), Kayleigh Irvine (Zetland), Maggie Kay (Whalsay), Rhea Nicolson (Burra), Victoria Duthie (Whalsay), Cara Leask (Delting), Kristan Robertson (Burra), Stacey Laurenson (Burra) and Sarah Williamson (Burra).\n• Follow The Shetland Times\u0026#8217 website and Facebook page this weekend for scores and updates\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nFriday 10 Aug 2018 11:39 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116804.jpg","title":"Beauty spot gets the all clear from SEPA","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nBadenoch and Strathspey\u0027s most popular bathing spot has been given the all-clear from blue-green algae which can make humans very ill and potentially be fatal to dogs.\nThe Scottish Environment Protection Team attended at Loch Morlich at Glenmore on Tuesday following reports of an outbreak at the beauty spot which is enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of people every year.\nSigns had been erected at key locations around the loch warning visitors of the potential presence of the algae.\nIt is understood that a concerned local vet raised the possibility of the algae being present after a dog took ill showing symptoms of having been in contact with blue algae following a visit to the beauty spot.\nA SEPA spokeswoman said: \"A member of our team went to Loch Morlich on Tuesday to take a sample of the algae and none could be found.

It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/david-mundell.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It was a fantastic opportunity to meet with like-minded individuals and share information regarding our available resources and capabilities. We are looking to make this a regular occurrence which will benefit all agencies. Recruitment was also a priority for the agencies and we are keen to encourage new, keen local individuals to become part of our emergency services family. We look forward to hearing from interested members of the public who may become valuable members of the emergency services in the future.”\nAs far as the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is concerned, Mr. Colliar said anyone is welcome to drop in when training is taking place at Skye fire stations. Dunvegan, Portree, Staffin and Raasay train between 7 pm and 9 pm every Monday, as does Raasay, while Uig is on a Tuesday evening and Broadford on Wednesday. Those stations will also be open to the public on the weekend of 28th and 29th July between 10 am and 2 pm. The service is looking for retained firefighters across Skye and Raasay.\nThe Skye Mountain Rescue Team, British Red Cross and the Maritime Agency Coastguard are currently looking for volunteers and can be contacted locally or through their respective websites.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

In fact, they were onaverage only nine years older than me.\nTheintensity of political struggle distorts the significance of age difference.Ten to 15 years between comrades can sometimes seem like an age.\nI saidthis recently to Jim Gibney as we talked about Ronnie Kasrils’ visit.\nRonniewill be 80 years-old this November. He has spent all of his life as a politicalactivist.\nBut helooks, and interacts socially, like someone much younger.\nBeforehe came to Ireland he inquired about the current ages of my own children.\nI jokedthat as they were getting older I was getting younger!\nHereplied that of course I’d be getting younger, because ‘The struggle keeps usall alert and in fine fettle.\nI firstbecame aware of Ronnie Kasrils in 1992 when the march on Bisho occurred duringthe phase of mass action in South Africa.\nHe wasinterviewed on international news as one of the key leaders and was veryarticulate.\nTheSouth African national liberation struggle was at a decisive period. Historywas clearly being made.\nSomeyears later in 2004 as Sinn Féin\u0027s Northern Chairperson Iproposed we invite an ANC representative to Ireland as part of the Cúige’s Céad (centenary) celebrations.\nThe Cúigeleadership agreed.\nBy thenRonnie Kasrils was the South African Minister of Intelligence.\nSo Ichanced my arm and sent off a letter more in vain hope than any realexpectation.\nRemarkablyRonnie wrote back accepting our invitation to visit Ireland, and, would do soas a representative of Thabo Mbeki’s government.\nNeedlessto say we were delighted (and, the Cúige had just been saved a fortune of moneyin plane fares!)\nAtremendously successful programme of events was organised and Ronnie Kasrilshad a big impact everywhere he visited and spoke.\nHe andother South African comrades returned the following year to share the ANC’sexperience of transition in government as we launched the big debate within therepublican base on policing.\nVerymany comrades have vivid memories of Ronnie’s contribution to our internalpolitical discussions during this period.\nHe alsoattended and addressed Ard Fheiseanna with his then wife Eleanor and thenafter her untimely death in 2009 he wrote a brilliant book about her own rolein the liberation struggle entitled the ‘Unlikley Secret Agent’.\nHislatest book ‘A Simple Man’ is a compelling critique of current day SouthAfrica.\nRonniewas a senior figure in the collective leadership of the ANC MK, or Unkhonto weSizwe (Spear of the Nation) and the South African Communist Party, as well asa Deputy Minister of Defence, and later Minister of Intelligence in SouthAfrica.\nThe newbook provides an analysis of the ANC’s transition from resistance to powerwhich is essential reading for all political activists.\nJoeSlovo, the former MK Chief of Staff, said to Ronnie Kasrils towards the end of1994 that very few people had enjoyed the unique privilege of serving in aliberation struggle and then in government as they had.\nAs acommitted internationalist he has consistently stood in support of the peopleof Palestine, Cuba and freedom loving people across the world.\nHe hasmade an important contribution to the Basque peace process.\nAlongwith others in South Africa he has strongly supported the Irish peace process,and Sinn Féin’s work to achieve an agreed, united Ireland.\nDuringtwo speaking engagements in Belfast and Derry he kept the audiences enthralledwith his political analysis. They reciprocated with standing ovations.\nIn theGasyard centre in Derry’s Bogside he raised the roof with a funny story ofmeeting Ché Guevara in Dar-es-Salaam where he said therevolutionary icon gave a speech on armed struggle in Africa which was “bollocks”!!!\nWe helda very dignified wreath laying ceremony at Martin McGuinness’ grave, duringwhich Ronnie spoke very emotionally of Martin’s legacy, before giving amilitary salute as one freedom fighter to another.\n\nIn aseparate moment towards the end of his stay he said to me warmly: “You’ve gotthe right strategy you’ve got the right politics. The humanity of your peopleand their commitment is so tremendous.\nWe allneed to be able to draw inspiration from history, past sacrifice, leadershipand determination.\nHeroworship is something altogether different. That’s the stuff of sycophancy andthe notion that the celebration of personality is the end itself.\nThephrase that “we stand on the shoulders of giants” refers to those who have gonebefore us, but left a legacy of inspiration and leadership by example.\nThisSunday the National Hunger Strike commemoration will take place inCastlewellan, County Down.\n\nTheIrish Hunger strikers are now among a pantheon of iconic Irish andinternational figures who symbolise the struggle for a better world alongsidethe leaders of 1916 Mary Ann McCracken Nelson Mandela Ché Guevaraand Ho Chi Minh.\nBertoltBrecht the socialist poet wrote:\n      “There are those who struggle for a day and that is good\n                There are those whostruggle for a year and that is better\n                And there are those who struggle for twenty tears and that is better still\n  Then there are thosewho struggle all their lives, and they are the ones we cannot do without”\nRonnieKasrils continues to politically campaign enthusiastically for a better worldeven while approaching the autumn of his life.\nThestruggle for Irish unity, independence, and an Ireland of equals has beenenriched by his friendship and solidarity.\nSinn Féin and other progressives inIreland are proud to call him our comrade and our friend.    \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27434  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\n“The vibrant, colourful and loud message from today’s Belfast Pride parade is that the ‘north is next’ and Sinn Féin will continue to campaign to ensure that this becomes a reality.” - Megan Fearon MLA\nSinn Féin joined thousands of people on the streets of Belfast today for the annual Belfast Pride finale in solidarity with the LGBTQ community. \nThe parade – led by the Belfast Pride Festival and Mayor of Belfast Deirdre Hargey – started at Custom House Square, made its way past City Hall and through Belfast City Centre. \n\nColourful banners and floats from businesses, community organisations, political parties, emergency services and campaign groups such as Love Equality joined the procession. \nThere was a clear message from today’s parade, there is a demand for equality for the LGBTQ+ community twinned with mass opposition to the DUP’s denial of marriage equality. \n, Sinn Féin Equality spokesperson, Megan Fearon MLA said pride is a display of ‘unity and determination’ to achieve equality. \n“It’s really important that we are all together here today to fight for equality of opportunity under the law. \n“Equality for all our citizens, but especially for our LGBTQ+ brothers and sisters.

It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

They know the Cadet movement is as much committed to building confidence and friendships as it is to building skills.\n\n“Our Banbridge Cadets embraced every opportunity brought to them at this year’s Summer Camp, held at Strensall, near York, with great good humour and seemingly boundless energy. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Now, following a Summer packed with challenge and achievement, they’ll be turning their attention to their annual new membership campaign and I am sure they will all become highly persuasive recruiters as they invite local teenagers to come along and see what Cadet life has to offer.”\n\nIf you would like to find out more about what membership of the Army, Sea or Air Cadets can offer you or your children, contact 0800 730 730 or visit www.reservesandcadetsni.org.uk.

To cater for the individual needs of the every member of the community, the team can also provide guidance on the bank’s Post Office service, its telephone banking system and its Bank on Wheels.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThroughout the year Richard will be organising a series of events open to the public as well as delivering presentations for schools and community organisations about the importance of staying safe and secure when banking, good practice for identifying fraud and scams, using the Ulster Bank Anytime Banking app and transitioning from traditional to digital banking services.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nCommunity Banker Richard Gill explained: “I’m really looking forward to engaging with people right across Co. Down and being an active part of this community.\n\n“Being financially fit, aware of how to keep your money safe and secure, and feeling confident in using digital technologies are important skills, and the events I’m planning to run will reflect that.”\n\nRichard will host regular drop-in clinics in Rathfriland and Dromore and on call to help customers Monday to Friday, between 9am and 5pm.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"celtic fan sorry for airport confrontation with novo","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself. I would like thank genuine Celtic supporter.”\n\nNovo was left fighting for his life in January after suffering a heart attack while starring in a Rangers legends tournament in Germany. The star received thousands of goodwill messages.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland chippies take carryouts to new heights","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Mallon of the Dolphin Takeaway in Dungannon will undertake The Kilimanjaro Chippy Challenge, serving up delights for hungry climbers at 15,255ft.\n\nArriving in Tanzania on September 1, the duo will climb the tallest free-standing mountain in the world, before setting up the highest pop-up fish and chip shop at the Barafu Camp.\n\nThey\u0027re aiming to raise much-needed funds for the Fishermen\u0027s Mission charity as a thank you to the trawler crews who keep their businesses supplied with the sea\u0027s bounty. \n\nAlan said he was proud to support the \"worthy\" charity, which helps those working in the fishing trade, the most dangerous occupation in the UK.\n\nHe said: \"Malachy and I have seen first-hand the great work the Fishermen\u0027s Mission carries out to support the fishermen who put their lives on the line to supply us with product. \n\n\"So I suppose the idea was born out of the need to raise awareness and much-needed funds for them. \n\n\"Malachy suggested the Kilimanjaro idea to me last year at the National Federation of Fish Friers Annual Ball and I instantly agreed to take up the challenge for this worthy cause. \n\n\"All of the donations we can get will make such a difference to those facing hardship.\"\n\nThe Kilimanjaro Chippy Challenge is the latest charity effort for Malachy, after he raised £9,000 by cycling 1,500 miles around the UK, visiting the winners of the Fish and Chip awards 2017.\n\nThe pair will climb for eight consecutive days, before cooking fish and chips and a few other favourites for the local orphanage before their record attempt. \n\nA percentage of the funds raised will be donated to the Fortune Kids and Education Foundation Orphanage Centre, which was opened in February 2016 and cares for children under five. \n\nWith the trip to Africa looming next month, Alan said they had stepped up their preparations.\n\n\"Although I live right in the heart of the Mournes, I had no previous climbing experience, but that has changed since last October,\" he said.\n\n\"I have been out trekking the mountains at least once a week for the last 10 months and this last month we have upped our training, sometimes covering five peaks and a distance of 25km a day.\"\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37173767.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/E%20310718KB4%20%200003.jpg","title":"pride 2018

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"simple majority in unity vote enough mike nesbitt","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Recently, I have also heard people talk about protecting the rights of the unionist, British community, but what I haven\u0027t heard is: \u0027We want you\u0027,\" he told the audience.\n\nHe was deeply critical of unionists for never saying the same to nationalists after partition.\n\nHe also spoke about his relationship with Martin McGuinness. He revealed that he had once told the Sinn Fein politician something that could have ended his own career. Mr McGuinness had kept his confidence, and he described him as a \"man of political integrity\".\n\nMr Dornan said nationalists had to make a detailed case for Irish unity and he\u0027d like to see any proposed deal in \"a 200-page dossier\".\n\nHe accepted 50% plus one was enough in a border poll, but said he\u0027d prefer if there was a \"resounding\" yes of over 70% as with the Good Friday Agreement. A Sinn Fein-only led campaign would either fail or scrape home, he warned.\n\nUnlike Arlene Foster, he said he wouldn\u0027t leave in the event of Irish unity, and it was \"a mistake\" for the DUP leader to have made such a \"reactionary comment\".\n\nHe expressed hope for a second referendum on leaving the EU and said Brexit\u0027s main proponents weren\u0027t \"people I\u0027d like to have dinner with\".\n\nHe was optimistic Brexit could be reversed by another poll, and said one-and-a-half million people who voted to Leave would likely be dead when the next election took place.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"six figure payout for staff who lost derry regeneration jobs","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It was also involved in developing the NI Science Park, and involved in the City of Culture bid.\n\nThe development body went through five chief executives in 13 years. One chief executive - former top civil servant Aideen McGinley - had to apologise before the Public Accounts Committee at Stormont after auditors confirmed Ilex had overspent £400,000 without approval from the government departments which set it up. \n\nIlex finally closed its doors in early 2016.\n\nLast night, Nipsa general secretary Alison Millar said: \"When the staff of Ilex were advised in October 2015 that the organisation was to close by the end of the financial year, and they would lose their jobs, it was a huge shock to them. \n\n\"This came following a review of Ilex, during which its board had been assured that there would be no surprises when the review report was published.\n\n\"At the time, Nipsa argued vehemently that, as some of the work of Ilex was being transferred to The Executive Office and the Strategic Investment Board, its staff should also transfer under the Transfer of Undertakings Protection of Employees Regulations (TUPE). This was rejected out of hand, the staff lost their jobs and Nipsa was forced into lodging Industrial Tribunal proceedings for our members.\n\n\"Without membership of the union, these individuals would not have been in a position to take a legal challenge themselves, so on their behalf, we are very pleased that Nipsa and our brave members have been totally vindicated.\"\n\nMs Millar said the settlement showed the union\u0027s case was right. \"While no financial compensation can replace someone\u0027s job and the trauma these unfair dismissals caused, the substantial six figure settlement reached in these cases shows that The Executive Office and the Strategic Investment Board were wrong in dismissing these individuals. \n\n\"As a result, this is money which will now come out of the public purse to compensate the individuals concerned.\"\n\nJohn McShane of McCartan Turkington Breen, who represented the trade union, said it sent a clear message to employers. \"This is a stark warning to employers of any size or sector that they should obtain legal advice in relation to their responsibilities to employees, as this case clearly shows that the financial implications of not following the legal protections of TUPE can be very serious indeed.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"temporary morgues planned for popes visit to ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass. Extra bus and rail services will be provided by Translink for people travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for the visit.\n\nBuses will be run across both days by Translink, with additional services from Belfast, Banbridge, Newry and Londonderry for the Saturday. \n\nOn the Sunday, as well as the destinations listed, additional services will run from Larne, Dungannon, Downpatrick, Limavady, Dungiven, Magherafelt and Newtownards. Additional rail services will also run across both days.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"house of fraser bought by mike ashleys sports direct","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The demise of House of Fraser in many ways has been the result of poor leadership, paralysis in innovation and crippling levels of debt,” Mr Lim added.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"mother held in dubai for three days after one glass of wine on flight","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

She said the pair were made to sleep on a “filthy” mattress and she was told to clean toilets and floors.\n\nShe said: “My little girl had to go to the toilet on the cell floor. I have never heard her cry in the same way as she did in that cell.\n\n“The food (we were given) smelled like rotting garbage and neither Bibi or I could face trying it. I stayed awake for the whole three days.\n\n“By now, Gary knew something was wrong and had flown to Dubai to look for me. Friends had found out I was in jail and tried to visit. Nobody was allowed to see us. We were not even told.”\n\nShe was released on bail and told her passport has been confiscated until the case is concluded. She said she has lost more than £30,000 in legal fees and missed work.\n\nMs Holman is now spending time with her other children Suri, nine, and Noah, eight, who have flown out to Dubai to see her while Gary returns home with Bibi.\n\nRadha Stirling, chief executive of Detained in Dubai, said: “The UAE maintains a deliberately misleading facade that alcohol consumption is perfectly legal for visitors.\n\n“Tourists cannot be blamed for believing that the Emirates are tolerant of Western drinking habits, but this is far from reality.\n\n“It is wholly illegal for any tourist to have any level of alcohol in their blood, even if consumed in flight and provided by Dubai’s own airline. It is illegal to consume alcohol at a bar, a hotel and a restaurant and if breathalysed, that person will be jailed.”\n\nMs Stirling called on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the UK Government generally to do more to “protect” British nationals, and claimed airlines were “complicit” and needed to be held “accountable”.\n\nThe FCO and Emirates have been contacted for comment.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"this park in new york wants you to destress with donkeys","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

When they come out here you can just see the stress melting away from them.”\n\nEmploying donkeys for animal-assisted therapy is gaining popularity among groups dedicated to protecting them from mistreatment.\n\nThe Donkey Sanctuary, based in Devon, offers donkey-assisted therapy programmes for children recovering from cancer, victims of human trafficking and other vulnerable people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe park was created by Steve Stiert, pictured (Mary Esch/AP)\n\n\n\n\n“We’re not providing therapy for the trauma but for developing life skills,” says Caron Whaley, therapy director at the Devon sanctuary.\n\nWhile donkeys are often portrayed in popular culture as gloomy or ill-tempered, they’re actually mild-mannered, intelligent and affectionate, donkey advocates say.\n\n“Some people come with the preconceived notion that they kick, they bite, they’re stubborn, they’re ornery,” Steve says. “None of those things are true at all.”\n\nSteve bought his first six donkeys from breeders but then started taking in rescues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe park provides free donkey-assisted therapy programmes and educational events (Mary Esch/AP)\n\n\n\n\nWhile he’s registered as a non-profit enterprise, Steve relies mostly on his own savings to care for the donkeys.\n\nHe doesn’t do birthday parties, nativity scenes or other money-making events, saying: “All our services are free. We don’t hire donkeys out.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"flames inch close to california homes as thousands evacuate","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Looking better out here \n#LakeElsinore\n \npic.twitter/Pv2KJDq39p\n\n— City Lake Elsinore (@CtyLakeElsinore) \nAugust 9, 2018\n\n\n\n\nMagee told residents at the community meeting to follow the mayor’s example and listen to evacuation warnings and orders.\n\n“I also want to remind you not to panic,” he said. “We are in great hands, the best in the world.\n\n“Pray for our town. Pray for our people,” he said.\n\nFire crews worked in 38C heat. Aircraft dumped bright pink lines of fire retardant to wall off the fire from homes. The 16-square-mile (41-square-kilometer) blaze was only 5 percent contained.\n\nThe fire is named for Holy Jim Canyon, where it erupted Monday and burned a dozen cabins.\n\nA resident of the canyon, 51-year-old Forrest Gordon Clark, was charged on Thursday with arson and other crimes that could send him to prison for life.\n\nClark refused to go to court on Thursday and his arraignment was postponed to Friday. \n\n\n\n#RangelandFire\n [update] off Rangeland Road and Highway 78 in Ramona (San Diego County) is now 250 acres and 60% contained.

The fires were 51% contained.\n\nIn the Redding area, the year’s deadliest fire was nearly half surrounded and was burning into remote and rugged forest land but grass, brush and trees there are so dry from years of drought and recent heat that the potential remained for the fire to grow, state fire officials said.\n\nThe Carr Fire, as it is called, killed six people, including two firefighters, and burned more than 1,000 homes. \n\nTwo other people — a state fire heavy equipment mechanic assigned to the fire and a utility worker trying to restore power near the fire— have died in car accidents.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"north korea asks us to ease sanctions","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

[]).push({})\n\n\nThe call comes as the rival Koreas plan to hold high-level talks on Monday to prepare for a third summit between their leaders and as Washington and Pyongyang try to follow through on nuclear disarmament vows made at a US-North Korea summit.\n\nIn the most recent sign of growing frustration between Washington and Pyongyang, North Korea criticised senior American officials for insisting that North Korea give up its nuclear weapons first before easing sanctions.\n\n\n\nWe hoped that these goodwill measures would contribute to breaking down the high barrier of mistrust\nNorth Korea foreign ministry spokesman\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nNotably, the statement did not directly criticise President Donald Trump, who met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June.\n\nNorth Korea said in a statement on Thursday that “some high-level officials within the US administration” were making “desperate attempts at intensifying the international sanctions and pressure”.\n\n“We hoped that these goodwill measures would contribute to breaking down the high barrier of mistrust” between Pyongyang and Washington, the North’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson said.\n\n“However, the US responded to our expectation by inciting international sanctions and pressure.”\n\nThose American officials are “going against the intention of President Trump to advance the DPRK-US relations, who is expressing gratitude to our goodwill measures for implementing the DPRK-US joint statement,” it said referring to the North by its official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\n\nWashington has said that sanctions will not be lifted until Pyongyang fully and finally dismantles its nuclear weapons.\n\nSome experts say that North Korea does not want to denuclearise first or maybe denuclearise at all because it wants a long, drawn-out process that sees external aid shipped in in return for abandoning nuclear weapons.\n\nPyongyang has also stepped up its calls for a formal end to the Korean War, which some analysts believe is meant to be the first step in the North’s effort to eventually see all 28,500 US troops leave the Korean Peninsula.\n\nA South Korean official at the Unification Ministry said the two Koreas will also discuss on Monday ways to push through tension-reducing agreements made during an earlier summit between Mr Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\n\nAmong the agreements was holding another inter-Korean summit in the fall in Pyongyang.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un, left, with South Korean President Moon Jae-in (Korea Summit Press Pool via AP)\n\n\n\n\nThe rival Koreas may try to seek a breakthrough amid what experts see as little progress on nuclear disarmaments between Pyongyang and Washington despite the Singapore summit in June and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s several visits to North Korea.\n\nPyongyang insisted that the US should reciprocate to the North’s suspension of missile launches and nuclear tests and other goodwill gestures such as the return of remains of American troops killed in the Korean War.\n\nThe United States cancelled a joint war exercise with South Korea that was due to take place this month while dismissing calls to ease sanctions until the North delivers on its commitments to fully denuclearise.\n\nThe inter-Korean meeting on Monday will be held at Tongilgak, a North Korean-controlled building in the border village of Panmunjom.\n\nSouth Korea’s unification minister will lead the delegation from Seoul but North Korea, which proposed the Monday meeting first, did not confirm the makeup of its delegation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Korean unification minister Cho Myoung-gyon (Ahn Young-joon/AP)\n\n\n\n\nIt was not clear when another inter-Korean summit might happen, but if the April 27 summit agreements between Mr Moon and Mr Kim are followed through on, the leaders will likely meet in Pyongyang in the next couple of months.\n\nIn the meantime, both Koreas are seeking an end of the Korean War.\n\nSouth Korea’s presidential spokesman said last month that Seoul wants a declaration of the end of the 1950-53 war sooner than later.\n\nThe Korean Peninsula is still technically in a state of war because the fighting ended with a ceasefire, not a peace treaty.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, North Korea’s Rodong Sinmun said in a commentary that ending the Korean War is “the first process for ensuring peace and security not only in the Korean peninsula but also in the region and the world”.\n\nMr Kim and Mr Moon met in April at a highly publicised summit that saw the leaders hold hands and walk together across the border, and then again in a more informal summit in May, just weeks before Mr Kim met Mr Trump in

Since he is an Irish national, he could now be deported. Charges are very serious.

Austins building in the city centre, the Derry News can reveal.\n\nThe department store, which has stood in the heart of Derry’s city centre for 188 years, closed over two years ago with the loss of 53 jobs.\n\nIt was opened by Thomas Austin in 1830 and remained in his family until the 1970s when it was bought by Derry businessman, Larry Hasson.\n\nIn November 2014 the store was placed into administrative receivership.\n\nThe receiver, the City Hotel Group, then sold the trading side of the business to Hassonzender Ltd and the store remained open until in March 2016.\n\nHowever, planning approval has now been issued by Derry City and Strabane District Council last week which will see the ‘refurbishment and restoration’ of the vacant listed building, with the new rear extension to the upper floors.\n\nThe work also includes the re-design of the shop front with ‘traditional materials and appearance’, while the offices on the fourth floor of the building will be changed to accommodate retail floor space.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])

the Austins Regeneration Trust Limited.\n\nSpeaking to the Derry News earlier this week, Brendan Duddy of the City Hotel Group said that they were pleased to have secured the approval for the refurbishment.\n\nHowever, he said that there had been ‘no progress’ made in putting the building back into use.\n\n“We got the planning approval secured last week, so we’re delighted with that,” Mr Duddy said.\n\n“Unfortunately, there has been no movement with getting the building back into use.”\n\nMr Duddy also told the Derry News that there was no plans for the building to be used for accommodation, namely apartments.\n\n“Not to my knowledge, no,” he continued.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"mobile breast screening unit returns rath mor centre creggan area derry appointments now
