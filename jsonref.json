He is pictured a company after party in Beverly Hills, California on January 8, 2017Harvey Weinstein\u0027s laywers have called on the film studio he used to co-own with his brother to hand over a stash of his work emails, claiming they could help clear his name.In a filing with the US Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, an attorney acting for the disgraced movie mogul said the Weinstein Company has refused to allow him access to e-mails that were relevant to ongoing criminal and civil lawsuits.The 66-year-old was fired by the company after dozens of women including actresses Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek accused him of offences including sexual assault and rape. The film studio filed for bankruptcy in March amid the scandal.Weinstein is the target of federal and state criminal investigations in at least four different jurisdictions, including New York, Los Angeles, and London, which have requested documentation relating to their cases, according to the filing.He is also the subject of at least 11 civil suits, including one brought by British aspiring actress Kadian Noble. Weinstein denies all claims of non-consensual sex. According to his attorney, Scott D. Cousins: \u0027It is critical that Mr. Weinstein be granted access to e-mails relevant to the certain civil proceedings and criminal investigations and that are in the Debtors\u0027 possession, as they were sent or received by his TWC e-mail accounts.  The 66-year-old was fired by the company\u0027s board after dozens of women including actresses Angelina Jolie (left, in London on Feb 18) and Salma Hayek (right, in Beverly Hills on April 14) accused him of sexual offences \u0027The Debtors\u0027 continued refusal to permit Mr. Weinstein to access these emails has significantly impinged his ability to effectively defend himself from these allegations and is a continuing deprivation of his due-process rights.\u0027Weinstein\u0027s lawyers previously filed a suit asking a Delaware state court to force open up access to his work emails on October 8, but that attempt failed.Anthony Bourdain advises Alec Baldwin to \u0027just shut up\u0027...Italian \u0027Harvey Weinstein\u0027 is charged with three counts of...Doors from the Chelsea Hotel sell for $400,000 including the...Share this articleCousins blasted the Weinstein Company\u0027s board, which includes his brother, Bob, saying it was against their interests to deny him access to the emails as doing so exposes them to increased civil liability.\u0027To put it bluntly, TWC, and its counsel, may be knowingly withholding e-mails that may exonerate Mr. Weinstein and, importantly, that would aid in the efficient conclusion of multiple pending criminal investigations and civil litigations, thereby limiting significant potential liability to the Debtors and their estates,\u0027 he argued.          Weinstein is  the subject of at least 11 civil suits, including one brought by British aspiring actress Kadian Noble (pictured in New York on November 28The Weinstein Company itself has been sued by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman over claims it tolerated the \u0027systematic\u0027 sexual abuse of staffCousins said the Weinstein Company had already provided a \u0027handful\u0027 of emails which were already in the hands of investigators.He added that he was confident Weinstein would be able to obtain a \u0027favorable conclusion\u0027 to the cases against him if he is able to view the emails.The Weinstein Company was set up by Harvey Weinstein and his film producer brother Bob in 2005. It filed for bankruptcy after it spent months looking for a buyer or investor.Texas private equity firm Lantern Capital agreed to buy the company out of bankruptcy for $310 million, setting the floor for other bidders in a court-supervised auction scheduled for May 4.While the film studio has produced and distributed critically acclaimed movies as \u0027The King\u0027s Speech\u0027, as well as the televised fashion competition \u0027Project Runway,\u0027 the entertainment industry distanced itself from the studio after the accusations against Harvey Weinstein rocked Hollywood.The women who spoke out against Weinstein spurred a national movement against sexual harassment, with victims sharing their stories on social media and labeling them under the hashtag #MeToo. Dailymail.com has contacted Weinstein\u0027s representative for comment.            The Weinstein Company filed for bankruptcy after it spent months looking for a buyer or investor.

Neither of them would\u0027ve eaten anything if it wasn\u0027t for her.\u0027Mrs Wignall bumped into a friend of hers called Kate on the first day of the holiday and after spending time with her, realised she had been looking after the girls as well.The women claim they would look after the girls whenever they saw them around the hotel but they were often left with other families while their parents were out on the strip or at the bar.          Mrs Wignall\u0027s friend Kate Lees took to Facebook to share the \u0027shocking\u0027 story She told MailOnline: \u0027The first time I saw them I felt very uncomfortable.\u0027One night we saw them on their own and when we eventually found the mum she was absolutely paralytic. \u0027She was so drunk she couldn\u0027t even lift her head up to speak to us, let alone string a sentence together.\u0027I don\u0027t know where the step-dad was. The eldest kept saying she had to ring her dad in Scotland, we didn\u0027t know what was going on.\u0027On the final night of her stay Mrs Wignall saw the girls again and asked who would be looking after them when her and her friend had gone.She claims they told her a young couple from Wigan had agreed to take care of them while their parents went out.But when she came to check out in the early hours of Thursday reception staff told her the girls had been taken off the couple because they were also too drunk and their parents had been arrested.She said: \u0027When I left on Thursday I told the receptionist I had serious concerns about two young children staying in the hotel.           Mrs Wignall said the children \u0027could have ended up like Maddie McCann (pictured), who disappeared from her family\u0027s hotel room in Portugal in 2007 \u0027They said the father had been arrested and the hotel staff were now officially responsible for them, because the couple the parents had left them with were too drunk to look after them.\u0027The mum and step-dad had been taken away by the police and the children\u0027s entertainer had to stay in a room with there was no one else.\u0027Officials in Majorca said the police had been called after the mother allegedly assaulted one of the other women who had been looking after her daughters.Mrs Wignall says this was the drunk British woman, but this has not been confirmed. A spokesman for the National Police in Majorca said: \u0027National Police officers have arrested a British couple who were on holiday as the suspected authors of a crime of child abandonment. \u0027In the early hours of Thursday morning and at a hotel in Playa de Palma, hotel security staff were alerted to the abandonment of two children by their parents.\u0027The family of four had arrived two days earlier. Following their arrival, the parents were usually drunk and would regularly leave the hotel and leave their children there.          The couple were arrested by Spanish police on Thursday and the children left with social services until their mother was released yesterday. Her partner was not allowed to fly home to Scotland with them. Pictured: Palma Bay Club resort \u0027After security staff warned them about their illegal behaviour, they convinced another British couple who they didn\u0027t know, to look after their children while they went drinking in different bars in the resort.\u0027They would return totally drunk.

Former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown described the MoS’s revelations as ‘horrifying’ and urged Google to pay users an annual fee for plundering their dataIt then uses the information to build an advertisement portfolio of its users’ interests.Businesses pay millions to Google to show their adverts to people whose data has indicated they may be interested in their products.While most realise adverts they receive are often based on their search history, few will be aware of the extent to which the company tracks their every online move.Experts have warned that Google’s huge cache of data may breach new data protection regulations which are due to be introduced next month.Web developer Dylan Curran, 24, requested all the information Google holds on him and was stunned by the results.He said: ‘I work in technology and had no idea Google was harvesting this amount of information.          Businesses pay millions to Google to show their adverts to people whose data has indicated they may be interested in their products‘What was particularly shocking was it had a record of websites I looked at while I was in Google’s private, incognito mode.‘It also had files I had deleted from Google’s cloud service, including an old CV, as well as every photo I had taken on my phone.‘It’s wrong to trust any entity that big with so much information. They’re just trying to make money, and at some point someone is going to make a mistake.’A Mail on Sunday reporter discovered Google had an exhaustive and precise record of his activities for every day since December 2014. The information included times and details of visits to restaurants, shops and bars – and the mode of transport used to get there.The reporter’s movements were tracked with a blue line to indicate each location visited. Google searches he had made at each location were also included.Another reporter’s visit to a cemetery in Macclesfield was archived after he searched on Google’s Maps app for directions to a funeral. It also saved his search for directions to a hospital in Dublin when he visited A\u0026ampE, and later recorded when he was discharged.Lord Ashdown said: ‘I am shocked and horrified that the personal intrusion into our lives is so deep – if this was a communist state we would not be tracked so closely.‘I’m pretty tech-savvy and was not aware of this – it’s unbelievable. This Mail on Sunday investigation has revealed, in an extremely powerful way, just how intrusive and personal this is.Facebook under fire for selling ads on pages of wildlife...Share this article‘At the moment it is a Wild West and we’ve let it happen because we benefit from Google and don’t mind it making a bit of money.

But not many people know that the amount of information Google collects about them is just enormous.          But data experts complain the terms and conditions are confusing and do not state for how long it will hold their data‘It would be entirely possible to provide great services while protecting people’s privacy.

The keys came back sparkling.’A colleague of Emma Hatley, a partner at Stewarts Law and consultant on The Split, had to hire protection after a disgruntled spouse threatened him during a case.‘He actually attacked the judge outside the court,’ Emma says.Who gets what in a orce, including a collection of Christmas baubles and the family pet, is often battled until the last. ‘I had one case in which no one wanted the poor dog,’ Emma Hatley, a partner at Stewarts Law says. ‘It was really old. We had correspondence back and forth about it. The housekeeper took it in the end.’There was a case where a spouse sowed cress seeds into the Axminster carpet and then watered it, while another wife sawed the legs off the family’s Steinway piano because she didn’t want the husband to have it.A priceless wine collection is destroyed in The Split, a common occurrence, according to Sandra Davis – head of family law at Mishcon de Reya. In one of her cases, wine ‘ended up being poured down the toilet by the people who didn’t own it’.Sandra has also experienced a wrangle over a tea set. ‘The lawyer on the other side dropped one of the cups. That resolved the issue.’Pre-nups are also big business and can be more than illuminating for clients. During pre-nup talks, one of Deborah Jeff’s clients discovered her fiancé had a child that she didn’t know about but she still married him.Deborah adds: ‘I was acting for a retired Army major who was marrying a much, much younger lady. ‘When we declared there wouldn’t be the generous settlement she backed out of the marriage. He was devastated but did phone a couple of months later to say thank you.’  PS...Love CAN blossom  After years spent locked in court together discussing the most intimate parts of their private life, perhaps it’s not surprising.But producers on The Split were told that it wasn’t unusual for clients to fall in love with their lawyers and declare it even if it wasn’t reciprocated.Regardless of any romantic outcome, many friendships are forged from the lawyerclient bond.‘I’ve been to a few weddings but I tend to go to more decree absolute parties,’ says Deborah Jeff of Seddons. ‘I’ve been sent a few invitations to lavish ones in which you have to fly abroad to celebrate.‘Some people seem to have a bigger celebration than they did at the wedding.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/21/22/4B678E9F00000578-0-image-a-13_1524347831591.jpg","title":"Pippa Middleton 34 pregnant child","story":"    Pippa Middleton, the younger sister of the Duchess of Cambridge, and her husband James Matthews are said to be expecting their first child          The couple are said to be \u0027overjoyed\u0027 while sister Kate \u0027could not have been more delighted\u0027  Pippa reportedly had a 12-week scan last week and have apparently revealed the news to family and friends          James Matthews and Pippa Middleton married in Surrey in May last year (pictured)      Steal Pippa\u0026#39s bridal style in a high neck wedding dressExplore the couture collection here...Whilst everyone this year may be speculaitng about what Meghan will wear on her big day in a month, this time last year it was all about Pippa!

After basic searching and calling failed, they tried to lure with him treats such as sirloin steak and butcher’s sausages.They also tried enticing him with scent from a bitch in heat and even with unwashed clothes worn by his favourite member of staff from the rescue centre.The Campbells then adopted Drogo’s sister from Bosnia, to see if a family bond would bring him home.Meanwhile, Drogo has roamed the island, living wild, even through the harsh Scottish winter.Although he has evaded capture, the Campbells know he is alive and well. As well as sightings from across Arran he has been seen on a network of wildlife cameras installed by the family.Yesterday they pledged to keep trying to find their missing pet.          Paramedic Emma Campbell, 43, says that they have tried to tempt their pet back with sirloin steak and a bitch in heat but had no luckEmma Campbell, 43, said: ‘He’s a local celebrity. Everyone knows about this dog.’Paramedic Mrs Campbell and her husband Alan, 50, a roughcaster, have two children, Shaila, eight, and Gordon, five. The family, from Lamlash on the east coast of the island, rehomed Drogo as a replacement for their beloved dog, Bubba, who had died.When Drogo arrived, he was extremely nervous. Mr Campbell said: ‘He’s a lovely big dog. He never snarled, never bit anyone. But he was just so nervous.’ Mrs Campbell said: ‘I spoke to a specialist dog trainer, did research on how to settle him in, and stayed in touch with the rescuers in Bosnia. We got him toys, bowls, leads and a harness.’Four weeks later, Drogo bolted on his first proper walk.Mrs Campbell said: ‘He just panicked, knocked the lead out of my hand, and bolted. I did the wrong thing, and ran about trying to catch him. I now know you’re meant to crouch down and be quiet.          The dog is named after Game of Thrones character Khal Drogo, pictured, who is played by Jason Momoa‘We searched for hours. My friend put a post on Facebook and within hours the community rushed to help. \u0027We had 20 or 30 people out with dog treats looking for him in the first few weeks. But we were told he had gone into survival mode, wild mode, and he would just think everyone was a predator.’Drogo has been spotted across the island, which is 20 miles long and ten miles wide. Following expert advice, the family have moved traps and cameras to each new location.Mrs Campbell added: ‘It’s been crazy. After one sighting my friend Janis and I, and her dog, were sitting in Brodick graveyard for nearly an hour. We were going, “What the hell are we doing? We’re sitting in a graveyard with a bag of hot dogs”.’In September, missing dogs charity Harvey’s Army lent the family a cage trap. Baited with sardines, it was also fitted with cameras.In October, Julia Bate-Poxon, who runs the Bosnian shelter, sent a parcel. Mrs Campbell said: ‘Julia wore a couple of T-shirts constantly for three or four days. She sent them over with the scent on them.‘We put them in the traps, but a dog behaviourist said to also tie them in high places so the scent went further. By this time, Harvey’s Army had fundraised for six extra cameras. \u0027Every time there was a sighting we went out and set them up. It took hours. We did it constantly for months.’In December, the family even rehomed Goldie, Drogo’s sister, hoping that would lure their pet back.They know that Drogo has settled in the south of the island but now face a race against time – before lambing season begins in earnest."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/22/00/4B69874300000578-0-image-m-110_1524354970858.jpg","title":"Shock figures half graduates worst universities arent repaying loans","story":"    Bolton University vice-chancellor George Holmes, pictured, is on £220,000 a year, despite his university having the lowest number of graduated earning the loan repayment thresholdUK\u0027s biggest banks are pocketing £1BILLION a year by paying...Pippa Middleton, 34, \u0027expecting her first child\u0027 a year...Share this articleProf Holmes claimed starting salaries for Bolton students are lower because of reduced living costs in the town.He said: ‘Students do not hit the payback threshold as quickly but have a better standard of living with more disposable income.’Top of the league for well-paid jobs is the London School of Economics, where almost nine in ten graduates are earning above the threshold.

I didn\u0027t even stick around for his performance because it was breaking my heart.\u0027He added: \u0027I\u0027m shocked because I don\u0027t know medically what happened, but I can just say as a person, as a friend, and more importantly, as a musician, Tim was one of the greatest, natural melody writers I\u0027ve ever worked with, and I\u0027ve worked with some of the most brilliant musicians on this planet.\u0027Although Avicii quit touring two years ago, the DJ continued making music in the studio, and collaborated with everyone from Madonna to Coldplay.\u0027It\u0027s been a very crazy journey. I started producing when I was 16. I started touring when I was 18. From that point on, I just jumped into 100 percent,\u0027 Avicii told Billboard magazine in 2016.\u0027When I look back on my life, I think: whoa, did I do that? It was the best time of my life in a sense. It came with a price - a lot of stress a lot of anxiety for me - but it was the best journey of my life.\u0027 Avicii was a pioneer of the contemporary Electronic Dance Movement and a rare DJ capable of worldwide arena tour. He was part of the wave of DJ-producers, like David Guetta, Calvin Harris and Swedish House Mafia, who broke out on the scene as lead performers in their own right, earning international hits, fame, awards and more like typical pop stars. Avicii earned $250,000 a night when playing out sold-out shows, according to GQ, and was once named as one of Forbes\u0027 highest paid DJs.

The letter, which has been sent to Cabinet Office minister David Lidington by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, is reported to say that there is a risk legal residents who may not have a passport or driving licence may be disenfranchisedHe said: \u0027Forcing voters at election time to prove their identity at polling stations by producing official documents would have a disproportionate impact on people from black and ethnic minority communities.\u0027It is the same hostile environment all over again, shutting our fellow citizens out of public life, treating communities who made Britain their home as second-class citizens. It\u0027s disgraceful and it must be brought to an end.\u0027Meanwhile, Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said the Windrush problem has come about from a pro-European idea which suggests people need to show their papers.He told the Sunday Telegraph: \u0027We are not the sort of country that demands to see your papers, but I\u0027m afraid pro-Europeans think we should be.\u0027They buy into the EU-style relationship between inidual and state.

I think she is doing the best she can in the public eye\u0027 she told the Sunday Mirror.\u0027I\u0027ve always really looked up to her, like a big sister I never had. She took me shopping for kids books and clothes.\u0027She taught me how important it was to read books. She\u0027s kind, genuine, very thoughtful and warm\u0027 she added.Ms Rasmussen also said she was \u0027embarrassed\u0027 by the way her mother and other relatives had treated Meghan since the news of the engagement broke.   Samantha Grant, who shares a father with half-sister Meghan, said the former Suits actress should have invited several family members \u0027out of respect\u0027.\u0027At issue is not a matter of closeness as more than 1,000 complete strangers are invited,\u0027 she tweeted. \u0027Family is family. I have an uncle I have only seen once by I would never say he is not family because we are not close. Humanitarians move forward with love and kindness especially to family.\u0027  Ms Grant, who uses a wheelchair after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, later changed her profile picture to a snap of her and Meghan together when they were younger.          Meghan Markle has angered family members by not inviting them to the weddingHowever, according to a Palace source, the list of 600 guests does include several star names, including the celebrity vet who treated Meghan\u0027s dog. And all of Harry\u0027s aunts and uncles – Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Princess Anne – will be there.Last night Michael, 78, who had a distinguished 19-year US government career, told The Mail on Sunday how he helped Meghan get a job at the American embassy in Argentina in 2001 when she was just 20 – a position she later boasted about in interviews.\u0027I knew the ambassador and I asked him if he could help, as her application was a little on the late side,\u0027 he said. \u0027That\u0027s why I don\u0027t understand why she has been so indifferent towards me. It\u0027s uncalled for. I helped her out and I didn\u0027t ask for anything in return.\u0027I\u0027m upset and surprised about not being selected but if they don\u0027t want me there, then I don\u0027t want to go.\u0027This whole invitation thing has not been played out very well. I never did anything to embarrass Meghan. It seems to me they handled the arrangements poorly.\u0027It was not well thought-out because no Markles I know are going to the wedding, although you\u0027d expect the bride\u0027s father to be there. I\u0027m disappointed, but I hope she has a good wedding.\u0027Michael\u0027s daughter Trish Gallop, 58, added: \u0027People usually invite their families to weddings, whether they are close or not. I would have loved to have given her my best wishes. We as a family are very saddened that we won\u0027t be there to witness her beautiful celebration.\u0027The comments came amid growing disquiet about the wedding plans and who is \u0027in\u0027 and \u0027out\u0027.Palestinian rocket scientist is assassinated by \u0027Mossad\u0027...\u0027She was beautiful till the day she died\u0027: Jeb Bush\u0027s...Share this articleAmong those The Mail on Sunday understands are attending are TV \u0027supervet\u0027 Noel Fitzpatrick, former England football captain David Beckham and his wife Victoria, and tennis legend Serena Williams.Victoria Beckham declined to confirm if she and her husband were going, while Prof Fitzpatrick, who treated Meghan\u0027s beloved beagle Guy when he broke his legs, said: \u0027No comment.\u0027 However, Palace insiders say he is on the list.The main cast members of Suits, the legal drama that propelled Meghan to fame, have been invited, a source close to the show said, adding: \u0027They are thrilled.

At one point producers counted ten pairs of £500 designer shoes shoved under the lawyers’ desks.‘The paralegals have trainers under theirs so they can run to court to file papers before a deadline,’ Lucy says.The design team also had personalised pencils and mints made for The Split after seeing them at every firm. ‘We had to put notices up for the crew saying “don’t eat the props”,’ Lucy says.The programme is even filmed in a real law firm – the former offices of Olswang in London’s Holborn (above) – while the court scenes were filmed at a disused court in Kingston, Surrey.  Battles that go down to the baubles and pet dog   Despite the fictional stories that form the basis of The Split, not much can compare with the drama of real life.Family lawyers have told The Mail on Sunday a series of salacious anecdotes which make the on-screen antics seem pedestrian. Often, it’s the orce lawyers who take the flak.Deborah Jeff, head of family law at Seddons, had her tyres slashed after a long day in court over a £5million orce case.          Stephen Tompkinson and Meera Syal (pictured) play a warring couple in BBC show The Split ‘I took it as a compliment because I’d done an outstanding job,’ Deborah says. Debbie Chism, partner at Stewarts Law, who recently acted for Prince Louis of Luxembourg, has had people shouting ‘It’s MY money’ in her face.‘One client’s other half sent the keys to a property in something a horse might have done,’ Debbie adds.‘I sent it to their lawyer’s office, saying “You can open this”. The keys came back sparkling.’A colleague of Emma Hatley, a partner at Stewarts Law and consultant on The Split, had to hire protection after a disgruntled spouse threatened him during a case.‘He actually attacked the judge outside the court,’ Emma says.Who gets what in a orce, including a collection of Christmas baubles and the family pet, is often battled until the last. ‘I had one case in which no one wanted the poor dog,’ Emma Hatley, a partner at Stewarts Law says. ‘It was really old. We had correspondence back and forth about it. The housekeeper took it in the end.’There was a case where a spouse sowed cress seeds into the Axminster carpet and then watered it, while another wife sawed the legs off the family’s Steinway piano because she didn’t want the husband to have it.A priceless wine collection is destroyed in The Split, a common occurrence, according to Sandra Davis – head of family law at Mishcon de Reya. In one of her cases, wine ‘ended up being poured down the toilet by the people who didn’t own it’.Sandra has also experienced a wrangle over a tea set. ‘The lawyer on the other side dropped one of the cups. That resolved the issue.’Pre-nups are also big business and can be more than illuminating for clients. During pre-nup talks, one of Deborah Jeff’s clients discovered her fiancé had a child that she didn’t know about but she still married him.Deborah adds: ‘I was acting for a retired Army major who was marrying a much, much younger lady. ‘When we declared there wouldn’t be the generous settlement she backed out of the marriage.

And I was like, \u0027Whoa. Dude. C\u0027mon. What are you doing? What\u0027s going on? You said that that was done,\u0027            Music veteran Nile Rodgers has now revealed his fears over the producers alcohol issues as he was \u0027drunk\u0027 the last time they saw each other            Nile Rodgers paid tribute to the DJ on Twitter calling him his \u0027little bro\u0027 (pictured)\u0027We did a show and I was a little upset. I didn\u0027t even stick around for his performance because it was breaking my heart.\u0027He added: \u0027I\u0027m shocked because I don\u0027t know medically what happened, but I can just say as a person, as a friend, and more importantly, as a musician, Tim was one of the greatest, natural melody writers I\u0027ve ever worked with, and I\u0027ve worked with some of the most brilliant musicians on this planet.\u0027Although Avicii quit touring two years ago, the DJ continued making music in the studio, and collaborated with everyone from Madonna to Coldplay.\u0027It\u0027s been a very crazy journey. I started producing when I was 16. I started touring when I was 18. From that point on, I just jumped into 100 percent,\u0027 Avicii told Billboard magazine in 2016.\u0027When I look back on my life, I think: whoa, did I do that? It was the best time of my life in a sense. It came with a price - a lot of stress a lot of anxiety for me - but it was the best journey of my life.\u0027 Avicii was a pioneer of the contemporary Electronic Dance Movement and a rare DJ capable of worldwide arena tour. He was part of the wave of DJ-producers, like David Guetta, Calvin Harris and Swedish House Mafia, who broke out on the scene as lead performers in their own right, earning international hits, fame, awards and more like typical pop stars. Avicii earned $250,000 a night when playing out sold-out shows, according to GQ, and was once named as one of Forbes\u0027 highest paid DJs.

But the unseasonably warm London weather eventually took its toll and he came home in 2:04.17.Farah was clearly struggling over the last few miles but, roared on by the huge crowd basking in the sunshine, he claimed a hard-earned spot on the podium behind Kitata.Welshman Jones, who won the London Marathon in 1985, set his British record time of 2:07.13 in Chicago the same year.

Seventy artists – including several stars of the country’s emerging art scene – clubbed together and 168 pictures were sent to the UK for exhibition and sale.The pictures were duly shipped, but it took some high-level arm-twisting to persuade the Royal Academy to exhibit them. “It is amusing to read that the RA turned us down on the grounds that they didn’t like the pictures!” wrote one exasperated British Council staffer. “Neither do we: but that was not the point.”The show finally opened in November 1944, and went on to tour the country – though not without some eye-popping condescension, even from the critic who wrote the catalogue prologue. Sacheverell Sitwell drew parallels between Villa-Lobos, “who has written too much music”, and Diego Rivera, “who has over-painted”. He loftily concluded: “The progress of painting has been fast on this prolific soil, so fast that we may hope it will become slower and more serious.”So blinkered was the British art establishment about the potential value of any of the works that all but 25 of them left the country. Those that remained were doled out to 20 galleries around the UK, from Glasgow to Plymouth. They have had a sad afterlife, languishing unseen in storage – until this month, when a feat of sleuthing by an energetic Brazilian Embassy cultural attache has reunited all but one for an exhibition, The Art of Diplomacy, in London.This reminder of a time when Europeans had no idea what to make of Latin American art comes just as Brazil’s artists appear to be in higher demand internationally than ever. London alone will be showcasing three of them this summer, with Beatriz Milhazes at White Cube Bermondsey, Luiz Zerbini at the South London Gallery and Paulo Bruscky at the Richard Saltoun Gallery.Zerbini and Bruscky are making their UK solo debuts, as are the collective OPAVIVARÁ! who will invite visitors to sip herbal tea and swing in a giant rainbow hammock at Tate Liverpool. Meanwhile, Cinthia Marcelle – whose installation The Family in Disorder is at Modern Art Oxford – offsets OPAPIVARÁ!’s politics of community with a vision of order and chaos: humble building materials such as bricks, planks and paper are neatly stacked in one room and exploded in another, as if they were destroyed by riots or bulldozed by city planners.In the US, New York’s Whitney Museum recently staged a major touring retrospective of the neo-concretist Hélio Oiticica, while the city’s Museum of Modern Art has just opened a retrospective of Tarsila do Amaral, one of the 14 female artists who – unnoticed by Sitwell – contributed to the 1944 exhibition.So what’s so special about Brazilian art and why did it take the old world so long to recognise it? Tarsila, as she is affectionately called, was a member of the influential Grupo dos Cinco, a close-knit circle of five artists and writers who, as far back as the 1920s, had been making a case for a uniquely Brazilian modernism.“I feel myself ever more Brazilian,” she wrote to her family in 1923 from her base in France. “I want to be the painter of my country. Don’t think that this tendency is viewed negatively here. On the contrary. What they want is that each one brings the contribution of his own country … Paris has had enough of Parisian art.”The 1944 show came at a turning point for Brazilian art. The country was about to make a visionary investment in its cultural heritage, as RA curator Adrian Locke points out. Between 1947 and 1948 – when much of the world was exhausted by the second world war – Brazil opened three major galleries, one in Rio and two in São Paulo. In 1951, it took the audacious step of founding the world’s second biennale, which set out to rival Venice. Brâncuși, Picasso and Jackson Pollock were among the artists featured in the first two editions of the Bienal de São Paulo.The respect was slow to be reciprocated. Dawn Ades – who curated a landmark exhibition, Art in Latin America, at London’s Hayward in 1989 – tracks the turning point in the UK to two decades earlier, in 1969, when the Whitechapel featured an installation by Hélio Oiticica that has become a benchmark.Tropicália, a scaled-down version of which went on display at Tate Modern last autumn, aimed to evoke the higgledy-piggledy homes of Rio’s favelas, complete with tropical foliage and live parrots. “It was proto-performance art as well as this most wonderful construction,” says Ades. Oiticica, who died in 1980 at the age of 42, was “fascinating because, on one level, he was completely international, but he thought of himself as having Brazilian roots.”Guardian critic Adrian Searle noted as far back as 2007 that Tate Modern had been buying Oiticica’s work, revealing the increasing influence of a group that also included his friends and associates Lygia Clark and Lygia Pape. “Theirs was a modernism freed from northern, protestant restraint, and an art that strove to go beyond the gallery and the closed world of the market.” For Ades, the question of what makes Brazilian art so special is itself wrong-headed. She argues against the “irrelevant and dangerous tide of nationalism” that has pervaded the history of art for the last century, citing Cildo Meireles as another example of why its artists should be judged on an international level. His 2001 work Babel – a circular tower made of hundreds of old radios tuned to different stations – was also recently purchased for Tate Modern.On the coincidence of so many Brazilian solo shows in the UK, she says: “It might just be chance or it might be that there’s a very rich ferment going on in the country right now. There’s a real energy, but I certainly wouldn’t put them in a box that says Brazilian art. There’s a great exhibition to be done on the wave that goes from Brazil to Italy – arte povera – art that is on the edge of being an object in the real world.” The 24 pictures in The Art of Diplomacy might not all be world-class art but they contain forewarnings of this coming wave. The most powerful is a sinister oil painting in deep blues and browns of a small girl on a moonlit night, her head at an unnatural angle, as if she might be possessed by the toy she holds aloft on a stick. After the sale, which raised £1,000 for the RAF Benevolent Fund, The Scarecrow (The Half-Wit), by artist, ceramicist and poet Cândido Portinari, was donated to Harrogate’s Mercer gallery.A soft-porny landscape of bare-breasted women on a beach was the Tate’s only memento, gifted to the gallery by a Tory MP with more beneficence than taste. Even Cardoso Junior – the retired schoolteacher who painted the work, called They Amuse Themselves – might chuckle at the company he now keeps.• The Art of Diplomacy is at the Embassy of Brazil, London, until 22 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca391229d4ec13a1c2083cb52b17742afbc10bad/0_893_5680_3408/master/5680.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e2d0334f58717554377f1938956102d","title":"corita kent the pop art nun","story":"She shook up the church and the art world with her expressive, exuberant and boisterous workPop Art gave the world Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns in the US, and Richard Hamilton and Peter Blake in the UK, but one of its lesser-known stars was a nun called Corita Kent. During the late 1960s and early 70s, she used advertising slogans and song lyrics, as well as biblical verses and quotes from literature, to create vibrant silkscreens with trenchant political messages about racism, poverty and injustice.This year marks Kent’s centenary – she was born Frances Kent in November 1918 into a Catholic family in Iowa – and it’s being celebrated with an exhibition at Ditchling Museum of Art + Craft in East Sussex. What’s most striking is the juxtaposition of the monochrome nun – she wore the traditional habit complete with wimple and veil – and the brilliant colours which burst from her work.“Her art is expressive, exuberant, loud and boisterous,” says Ray Smith, director of the Corita Kent Center in Los Angeles. “But that contrasts with her own personality, because she wasn’t loud. She had a quiet intensity and was quite a private person.”Words sing out of Kent’s silkscreens, their simplicity often belying the complexity of their messages. In that they may have life (1964), she used images from a Wonder Bread wrapper to create a meditation on poverty and hunger, while in for eleanor (1964), she appropriated the US food giant General Mill’s slogan “The big G stands for goodness”, the source of which is a G for “God”.Threaded through her work is her life as a nun: she entered her order, the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, aged 18, trained as an art teacher and went on to head its college art department, leading to connections with leading artists, including the designer duo Charles and Ray Eames, film director Alfred Hitchcock and composer John Cage. But alongside acclaim from the art world came criticism from traditionalist Catholic churchmen – especially Cardinal James McIntyre, who took offence at works such as the juiciest tomato of all (1964), in which Kent likened the Virgin Mary to a luscious tomato.After the reforms of Vatican II, Kent and her fellow nuns decided to abandon their habits and do more community work McIntyre’s opposition to this led Kent to leave the order in 1968. She moved to Boston, living alone at the age of 50 for the first time. Her work between then and her death in 1986 is quieter and reflects a search for meaning from other religious traditions. It includes nature-inspired watercolours, as well as pieces that reflect her experience of cancer, such as live the moment light and out of the darkness (both 1977). But it’s her works from the 1960s that underline her relevance today. They trumpet her belief that social injustice can be changed and that at the heart of life it is love, and caring for others, that matter more than anything.Corita Kent: Get With The Action is at Ditchling Museum of Art + Craft, 5 May to 14 October (ditchlingmuseumartcraft.org.uk)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46969f6f0400caaabf4f2684c6b50914ac8dae8d/0_829_6884_4132/master/6884.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51f5c0aef75a10215fd018d8682757ca","title":"soviet film posters of the 50s and 60s in pictures","story":"After the break-up of the USSR in 1991, many artefacts associated with Soviet life – from posters to gadgets – were discarded, destined to be forgotten.

Emma Brockes meets her in New YorkWhen Hanya Yanagihara was 10 years old, her father let her visit a pathologist’s lab. He was a doctor and an artist, twin interests his young daughter shared so that when the pathologist opened the cadaver, she whipped out a sketch pad and started to draw. “I was always interested in the disease, not the human,” she says of that early fascination with medicine, a forensic interest that foreshadowed the themes of her fiction and, 30 years later, found Yanagihara in an unusual life: writing acclaimed novels at night, with a day job as a senior editor at the New York Times. Fiction, says the 43-year-old, “is a completely other realm that’s untouchable and unknown”. Editing a magazine – in this case, T magazine, the New York Times style supplement – is not. She smiles. “I’ve never done it any other way.”We are in Yanagihara’s office at the New York Times, where the wall is adorned with page proofs for forthcoming issues of T and a blown-up cover of A Little Life, her second novel, a 700-page weepy about a group of male friends in New York that was a big hit in 2015. (The cover features the now-familiar image of a man who appears to be in agony, but is actually drawn from a series of photos taken by Peter Hujar of men in the throes of orgasm.) There are plenty of precedents for best-selling novelists who also held down a day job: Arthur Conan Doyle was a surgeon Joseph Heller wrote Catch-22 in the evenings while working as a copywriter during the day Anthony Trollope did three hours on his novel before going to work at the post office, and Toni Morrison raised two sons on her own while writing novels at night and working every day as an editor at Random House. Where Yanagihara is unusual, perhaps, is in the fact that the demands of her day job require an enormous amount of nervous, creative and managerial energy, which the casual observer might imagine she’d prefer to invest in her fiction.In Yanagihara’s case, returning to the magazine world was a question of disposition and financial necessity. While a big seller by the standards of literary fiction, A Little Life was hardly Fifty Shades of Grey and Yanagihara lives in an apartment in downtown Manhattan with overheads that serious novels don’t support. It’s a stylish life and while she is dressed today in workman-like denim, an advertisement for the daylight-hours side of her nature, elsewhere whimsy reigns. In a recent photo shoot, Yanagihara’s apartment was shown to be stuffed with 12,000 books and various treasures (a plaster bust of Ho Chi Minh from Saigon a solid-silver cow from Mumbai a print by the Japanese photographer Hiroshi Sugimoto), a space she characterises as “dusty and cluttered” and about which, she says smiling, T magazine’s design editor “can’t say anything nice”. The magazine, which she calls “a culture magazine masquerading as a fashion magazine”, expresses not only the range and depth of her interests, but also a commitment to her belief in good writing. “Style writing shouldn’t be dumb,” she says. “It should be done with finesse, but also with as much authority and background as you would have reporting a piece about the NSA, or the Trump White House. We are part of a great reportorial institution, and I think style writing has become lumped in with squiffy opinions and laziness.”All of this may come as something of a surprise to those who only know Yanagihara through her novels, both the rigour of her journalistic engagement – she very much believes in reporting, quoting an old editor of hers who used to say: “When the writer does a story, I want them to talk to 10 sources and read three books,” an ethos which the New York Times, increasingly rarely among newspapers, still has deep enough pockets to support – and her discipline. In person she comes across as pragmatic, quick-talking, unsentimental about the costs of doing two difficult jobs, one of which is perennially living alone. A Little Life, by contrast, is expansive, overblown, at times almost mawkish, with a child abuse sub-plot of such startlingly graphic description that although it was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize, it has about it a whiff of the Pat Conroy pot-boiler.Working a day job actively helps with the other side of her life and offers some relief from the worst aspects of novel writing. “Magazines are very collaborative. It is something that’s created by many and that’s wonderful, because fiction writing is so interior and makes you into an awful person in a lot of ways. The private,” she says, “becomes much more sharply private when you have a job, especially one that’s in the world. It reminds you on a daily basis of what people sound like, how they move, what their concerns are, how they think.”When she started editing the magazine at the end of 2017, she felt as if she was “being hit by a bus every day”. But slowly, as she “gets used to the rhythm,” she feels the machinery of the fiction-writing side of her brain firing up. “I worked through the first novel, too,” she says. “Some people are very disciplined, but I’m not. I need something to parse my time.” Her job as an editor offers this, too: a daily reminder that writing is a business that should, to her mind, be characterised by “a useful lack of romance” that rests on the principle: “No one will read it if you don’t turn it in.”Hanya Yanagihara’s first novel, The People in the Trees, was published in 2013 and was partly based on the true story of Daniel Carleton Gajdusek, an American medical researcher who won the Nobel Prize in 1976 for his work in Papua New Guinea and who was later ostracised after being convicted of child abuse. The story established the novelist’s twin interests in the traumas of the body and the way in which the mind seeks to absorb them – a theme she would return to in A Little Life, which has its roots in aspects of her childhood.Glancing at her biography, I had wondered if Yanagihara, who moved around a lot as a child, from California, to her father’s native Hawaii, to New York and Connecticut before returning to Hawaii again, missed out on having a single point of origin, the equivalent of John Updike’s Shillington, Pennsylvania, or Philip Roth’s Newark, New Jersey. In fact, she says, “I think of Hawaii as my Newark. I always say that for Asian Americans, Hawaii is the imaginary homeland. It’s the closest thing that Asian Americans have to Harlem, the place where everything about the culture at large feels familiar, or invented by you. It’s where I consider home even after all these years in New York.”Yanagihara’s parents – her mother was born in Seoul but grew up in Hawaii – met on the island and those early books by Roth were recommended to Yanagihara by her father, a great and eclectic reader whose tastes have informed her own. “He liked a British female writer of a certain age he loved Anita Brookner – and I do, too – and he loved Iris Murdoch and Barbara Pym. They’re books about loneliness and ageing, and they’re funny and a little devilish. Pym always has a few asides about how awful writers are, and Brookner does, too. There is a suspicion of the craft that the male writers of their generation didn’t have, a metaphysical reckoning of what is it actually doing for the world?”They are also books characterised by a stark lack of sentimentality. As a child, she wasn’t squeamish when she watched the pathologist at work, she says, “because death was a frequent topic of conversation and my father was never hesitant about showing me pictures of different kinds of skin illnesses, and so forth. It wasn’t something to be ashamed of – the body. Many cultures in the world are taught to be so ashamed of it that death is somehow embarrassing the naked corpse – you can’t see past its nakedness. Embarrassment about death, which is obviously linked to fear of death, is somehow equivalent to embarrassment about the body. This idea that the body is not about the form, but about the spirit animating it and once it leaves then it’s nothing, was never something that I grew up being taught to believe.”She would love to have gone to medical school, she says, and in fact after that early experience watching an autopsy, would like to have been a pathologist. “My father said it’s a good career because you’re left alone a lot and it takes a certain amount of artistry and technicality, and other doctors defer to the pathologist.”The secrets of the dead?“Exactly. But I just didn’t have the grades for it.”Instead, after graduating from Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, she moved to New York and went into publishing. Yanagihara wasn’t a good editor, she says. She couldn’t pick hits – “I didn’t have the eye for it. I bought one book the entire time I was there” – and so after a few years she side-stepped into magazines, working first at the now defunct Brill’s Content and later for many years as an editor at Condé Nast Traveller. “I liked the personalities there, I liked the brashness of it, I liked the democracy of it, the pace, working with visuals, and I liked the kind of sense, unlike a book, where it takes however many years for the poor writer to write and then 18 months to produce, that with a magazine you have a chance to make it new every single time.”It is her mother’s sensibility that has informed Yanagihara’s style, not only her taste but her belief in the importance of “material culture”. Her mother, she says, “has a great sense of design. She really understood textiles, she was a wonderful seamstress, she understands colour, she has excellent taste, and she can make anything with her hands. When I was growing up almost everything I had, from toys to clothes, were made. And she understands flowers – she could name a lot of things so could my father. It was important for them that I knew how to identify different chairs from different periods, or different fabrics, and they were interested in the people who made them. The idea of being a ‘maker’ was important the person who actually made things to beautify one’s life was essential to them. And they still make things. They’re currently learning how to weave Hawaiian straw hats. My mother makes beautiful flower leis. Doing things with their hands – they were both illustrators when they met.”The integrity of the product is its own reward and, to that extent, Yanagihara’s success as a novelist has been a surprise bonus. She expected A Little Life to sell 5,000 copies and would have been happy with that. Instead, it sold tens of thousands and inspired many rapturous reviews, including one in the New Yorker, which described it as a novel that could “drive you mad, consume you, and take over your life” – although, says Yanagihara, it often surprises people that after its success, she couldn’t put her feet up and retire. The money, she says, is not “enough for me to live on, which I think people assume it is”. One of the many reasons she returned to the New York Times was for the health insurance.When she took the job, she told her employers: “I won’t go out at night.” She judges this to be an important part of maintaining her stamina and preserving what energy she has left for her fiction. “I’ll go out occasionally for an advertiser event, if it’s deeply important but I typically only go out once a week. And the rest of the nights I spend at home, thinking and doing what I want.” (The only time she misses living with someone, she says, is “when something breaks”.)We get up to look at the page proofs for a forthcoming edition of the magazine, which is devoted to New York in the early 1980s, a period of cultural dominance in the city she compares to Berlin in the 1930s. “Every magazine editor has that period, an aesthetic set point they return to again and again, and for me it’s always been this one,” says Yanagihara. One photo spread features a group shot of people who got their start in early 1980s New York and looking at the line up – Willem Dafoe, Glenn Close, Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew Broderick, Harvey Fierstein, Elizabeth McGovern, Joan Allen, Cynthia Nixon, among others – you can only marvel at the hours that must have gone into arranging it. On another page, Yanagihara reproduces the spine-chilling news story from the New York Times of 3 July 1981: “Rare cancer seen in 41 homosexuals”. Michael Cunningham writes the issue’s closing essay.It is a love letter not only to New York, but to the idea of the centrality of art and culture to one’s life and Yanagihara explains her own life – its fullness and sacrifices – by quoting from a poem by Kenneth Koch: “You want a social life, with friends  A passionate love life and as well  To work hard every day. What’s true  Is of these three you may have two.” If half the battle in life is in knowing what you want and, by extension, what you don’t want, then Yanagihara seems to have it down pat. “The things the book have given me have been so unexpected and lovely,” she says of A Little Life. “But it’s not something that informs my daily life. It’s something that happens at night and when you’re specifically called. The rest of the time you’re Bruce Wayne.” She smiles at the strangeness of it. “But it worked well for Batman.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c32f6403d851c1bd7cd4ad72fb0e7e1d0638e009/930_0_2106_1264/master/2106.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8607281f9839431f68ab87a583f53833","title":"city faces corruption crackdown as imf investigates wealthy countries","story":"G7 nations plus Austria and Czech Republic face tests to prevent money launderingThe City of London will come under the spotlight of the International Monetary Fund as part of a crackdown on corruption that will investigate whether Britain and other rich countries are taking tough enough action against bribery and money laundering.In a hardening of its approach, the IMF said it needed to look at those giving bribes and financial centres that laundered dirty money as well as improving the existing clampdown on wrongdoing in poor countries.London has won the unenviable reputation of being the global centre for money laundering, partly as a result of cases such as the Global Laundromat, under which British-registered companies and banks helped move at least £20bn of money from criminal activities out of Russia.All members of the Group of Seven industrial nations – Britain, the US, Germany, Japan, France, Italy and Canada – together with Austria and the Czech Republic will be looked at by the IMF to see whether their legal systems criminalised bribery and have the right mechanism to prevent laundering of dirty money.Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, said: “The flip side of every bribe taken is a bribe given. And funds received through corruption are often funds concealed outside the country, often in the financial sectors of major capitals. It is quite possible for countries to have ‘clean hands’ at home but ‘dirty hands’ abroad.“To truly fight corruption, therefore, we need to address the facilitation of corrupt practices by private actors. To do this, we will be encouraging our member countries to volunteer to have their legal and institutional frameworks assessed by the Fund – to see whether they criminalise and prosecute foreign bribery and have mechanisms to stop the laundering and concealment of dirty money.”Lagarde said the willingness of the G7 plus Austria and the Czech Republic to allow their anticorruption regimes to be tested was “a major vote of confidence in the new framework”.The investigation will form part of the annual Article IV health check that the IMF conducts on every member country. Philip Hammond said in Washington that the size of the City of London meant he could not definitively say that there was no illicit money flowing through the UK financial system but that the government was working hard to reduce and eliminate illicit flows.Lagarde said there was empirical evidence to show that high levels of corruption were linked to significantly lower growth, investment, foreign direct investment and tax revenues.A country that slid down from halfway to three-quarters of the way down a league table of corruption and governance was likely to see growth of national income per head decline by half a percentage point or more.“Our results also show that corruption and poor governance are associated with higher inequality and lower inclusive growth.”The IMF has had guidelines for dealing with corruption since 1997 but Lagarde said there was a need for an updated policy that aimed for a “more systematic, evenhanded, effective and candid engagement with member countries”.She added that the IMF was developing a clear and transparent methodology to assess how big a problem corruption was in inidual poor countries. This would involve looking at the quality of government departments in charge of tax and spending, and the integrity of central banks. The IMF would then look at the impact of any governance weaknesses on long-term growth.Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, said: “Corruption is a threat to prosperity, security and trust in institutions. It is a barrier to development. We need collective international action by governments, business and civil society to fight it. Unless we tackle corruption, we won’t make the gains in development which we need to. “The UK is working with international partners to end impunity for those engaged in corruption, to recover assets stolen from developing countries and to empower citizens to stand up to and report corruption.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbf5ac6e12dac33b1713e9071322e4b59a953e58/0_115_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83237f3b0a6f16ccf60b26e56dd23974","title":"head of ebrd hopes to expand into sub saharan africa","story":"The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development keen to work with countries committed to market economicsA bank originally set up to help countries of the former Soviet bloc is poised to extend its operations into sub-Saharan Africa in order to speed up progress in meeting ambitious development goals set by the United Nations.Sir Suma Chakrabarti, the president of the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said his organisation had the money and the expertise to stimulate the growth of strong private sectors in some of the world’s poorest countries.Speaking to the Guardian in Washington, Chakrabarti expressed enthusiasm for expansion into sub-Saharan Africa if the member governments that own the bank gave the go-ahead.“Our shareholders need to start a debate about whether they want us to add to our capacity”, he said. “We have increased our geographical reach – to Mongolia, then Turkey, then the Middle East and north Africa, then Greece and Cyprus.“The biggest gap is sub-Saharan Africa. The biggest need there is private sector development which is what we do. If we get involved, we need to do so gradually and incrementally. Countries we work with must have a commitment to democracy and market economics.”With the EBRD prevented from lending to Russia since the start of the Ukraine crisis in 2014, Chakrabarti said the EBRD had all the capital it needed and could increase its lending by €2.5-3bn a year.The World Bank and the African Development Bank already operate in sub-Saharan Africa, but Chakrabarti said he did not envisage a turf war if the EBRD joined them.“There is so much to do. The African Development Bank was the biggest cheerleader for us to extend into north Africa and has said it would welcome us with open arms because there is a need for a strong private sector.”He said the EBRD’s business model was successful because it employed local staff, with only the mission heads non-nationals, adding that the UK government should be celebrating his bank as an example of the global Britain it wants to create after Brexit.Along with the International Maritime Organisaton, the EBRD is one of only two multilateral bodies based in London. Chakrabarti said India would soon join China as a shareholder in the bank, which had a strong development policy focus and attracted talented people from around the world. It is successful and it is profitable “We need to recognise the importance to the UK of this organisation. It is a good news story for Britain.”Chakrabarti said the international community needed to do more if the UN’s 2030 sustainable development goals  – 17 targets including eliminating poverty and providing universal quality education – were going to be met. “It is worrying that everyone has willed the objectives but not the means. Business as usual is not going to get us there.”The World Bank announced on Saturday an agreement to increase its capital by $13bn following protracted talks with the US Treasury.Chakrabarti said the agreement was good in itself, but added that it was also encouraging that the US was engaged with the multilateral system."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78ecba60ac468891f90f60aa81c8f7675d3f0a51/0_256_4231_2540/master/4231.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae843e51b28159f08bf14a0d281d5448","title":"labour to seek local support for 250bn regional renaissance","story":"Party to court regional mayors and councils over transport and infrastructure spending plansLabour is to begin courting regional mayors and councils over its plans for £250bn of transport and infrastructure spending, promising to prioritise projects that boost productivity and help the rest of the country catch up with London.Speaking to the Guardian, Peter Dowd, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the party would open a series of consultations with local leaders over the coming months on its proposals to help close the regional ide.Dowd, the shadow chancellor John McDonnell’s number two a former leader of Sefton council in Merseyside, will have responsibility for allocating the funding. He said spending decisions would be made in consultation with local areas.Research from the Centre for Cities thinktank estimates that Britain’s economy would be more than £200bn bigger if all cities were as productive as the capital and the surrounding south-east region.Ahead of the first major test of the country’s political sentiment since the general election, when local voting opens across the country next month, Dowd said: “We need to make a monumental effort for the north of England to deal with years of under investment and spark a regional renaissance for our country.”Labour research shows government spending of almost £600 per person on transport in London to be almost 15 times that of Yorkshire and the Humber. The proportion of construction spending in the capital is more than the entire north of England combined.“There’s a terrible imbalance in infrastructure spending across the country,” Dowd said. “London and the south-east gets significantly more than north-west, south-west and north-east regions. There has to be equality of approach for the funding.”The government wants to close the productivity gap between London and other parts of the country through its industrial strategy, which includes a £31bn national productivity investment fund for infrastructure projects and research and development. The slow recovery in the growth of efficiency among British workers, a measure of economic output per hour of work, has been blamed for holding back wage rises and improving living conditions since the financial crisis.Dowd suggested, however, that austerity had acted as a drag on the recovery for parts of the country. “Some regions have been denuded of resource for years, but they’ve also been denuded of any sense of ability to influence government,” he said.

Let’s decide. We live in a very isive age, so I\u0026nbspreckon it’s as well to get some practice in. \u0026nbspYou’ve got to be on one side or the other. In everything. The enemy of my enemy is my friend, as they say. (And we say. A bit of consensus there.) And, of course, anyone who says anything remotely disobliging about my friend\u0026nbspis my enemy, as you’ll know if you follow Momentum on Twitter.When I say that, I don’t mean to be slagging off Jeremy Corbyn. In case you thought I was. If I did that, I’d never hear the end of it. For the more rabid Corbyn fans, suddenly that’s all I’d be: one of the accursed slaggers-off. (To be clear, I’m not saying Corbyn has rabies. Hardly anyone has rabies. In fact, it’s a compliment: I’m saying Corbyn has so many fans that the group includes people who have rabies. Which is a vanishingly small percentage of the population. Which makes his fan group enormous. Go Jeremy!)Some of the most fervent Corbyn supporters seem unable to perceive any human interaction, anything written, broadcast or expressed, unless it’s either supportive or critical of their political hero. Nothing else shows up in their brain. Like ideological\u0026nbspTyrannosauruses, their vision is based on the\u0026nbspmovement.(To be clear, I’m not saying Jeremy Corbyn is a dinosaur. I was just referring to some of his supporters’\u0026nbspselective perception of the world around them, via a comparison to something in Jurassic Park and a pun on “movement”. He is, to reiterate, just absolutely peachy and I would totally say that even if I didn’t want a quiet life.)So, in that binary spirit, I want to know if pubs are rightwing or leftwing. I know it’s a weird question, but I’m just talking about a feeling you get. For example, I’ve always instinctively felt that cats are female and dogs are male, but apparently it’s more complicated than that. What sort of a vibe do you get off pubs?Some would say that all businesses are a bit rightwing, being creatures of capitalism. But then there are all those shops in the West Country that sell crystals – they’re businesses, in theory, but if they’re rightwing then next thing it’s going to turn out that bears don’t like honey and hippos have really squeaky high-pitched voices and nothing makes any sense at all.There’s no doubt that small businesses, and particularly failing businesses, feel a bit more leftwing than big profitable ones. And I hope both sides of the political spectrum can take that as a compliment. A pub that’s gone bust definitely feels to the left of one that hasn’t yet, but might – which itself is well left of a thriving City wine bar.I suppose I’ve always felt that a proper pub is a little bit rightwing – a bit to the right of me, anyway. And sometimes a lot to the right of me. More rightwing than a toy shop or a dry cleaner’s or a church. There’s a whiff of Clarkson, of enforced meat-eating, of inidualism, of cash. A pub would go for liberty over equality. If a pub could talk, it’s going to sound more like a taxi driver than a drama teacher. Rightwing is a simplistic way of describing it, but it’s a lot more accurate than leftwing.This is why I find the JD Wetherspoon chain interesting. I don’t like Wetherspoon pubs – I think they bring the ambience of an airport right into the centre of town. They’re not really pubs, it’s just a chain of bars. But, unlike other bar chains, it has the temerity to affect reverence for the very institution it is helping to undermine, the inidual local pub. Wetherspoon has even named several of its outlets the Moon Under\u0026nbspWater, the name George Orwell gave to the ideal\u0026nbsppub of\u0026nbsphis imagination. That’s like Center Parcs calling itself\u0026nbspNarnia.Yet within the firm’s dark heart of inauthenticity, there glimmers the light of something real: it’s genuinely a bit rightwing. Again, the term is insufficiently precise. I don’t mean the corporate right-leaning of almost any plc – this isn’t about corporation tax rates or the trading environment. I mean Little Englander rightwing, irritable old man rightwing, “it’s political correctness gone mad” rightwing, proper pub rightwing. Because, despite its stock market listing, Wetherspoon’s major shareholder, chairman and founder, Tim Martin, is still in charge. Effectively, it has a landlord.So, when the news broke last week that Wetherspoon\u0026nbspwas closing all of its Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts – for both the company as a whole and all of its inidual pubs – I was very surprised to find myself rooting for it. The last thing I was aware of Tim Martin doing was putting hundreds of thousands of pro-Brexit beermats in his pubs. I wasn’t keen on that. I also wasn’t lost in admiration for his decision to open the country’s first pub at a motorway service station. He didn’t seem all that nice.And then he takes his whole huge company off social media, saying “I find most people I know waste their time on it. A lot of them say they know they waste their time on it, but they struggle to get off it.” It’s unsettling when someone you’ve decided to dislike does something you approve of. It’s how an acolyte of Jeremy Corbyn would feel if one of his detractors suddenly attempted to assassinate Boris Johnson.I’m not on Facebook (just one of many things I have in common with Wetherspoon) but, if I were, I understand I’d regularly be called upon to say whether or not I “Like” things. “Liking” things is a bit like liking things, but with an emphasis on people seeing you Liking them, rather than actually liking them. Anyway, historically I wouldn’t “Like” Wetherspoon. I dislike it. Is there a Dislike button? Or is that just taken as read about everything you haven’t actively Liked?However, it’s all relative. Now that I see Wetherspoon lining up against social media, I know immediately which of the two I prefer. Say what you like about Tim Martin, at least he’s only Stalin to Mark Zuckerberg’s Hitler. And he’s welcome to put that on a beermat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38eb44e159224b300de6039ee3f5272bff7773e0/0_67_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb47cd7dfa7590a208b46ec8e3708589","title":"observer view on arsene wenger values his undoing","story":"The monarchy aside, Britain doesn’t really do longevity these days. The nation of “keep calm and carry on” and of “until death do us part” has often, it appears, given way to a land of attention deficit and the seductive thrill of quick fixes.No part of public life exemplifies this more clearly than professional football management. The average life of a Premier League boss now stands at just over a year. At the beginning of this season, Crystal Palace’s Frank de Boer set a new record by losing his job after five matches. All of which makes Arsène Wenger’s 22 seasons and 1,229 games in charge of Arsenal a modern miracle of persistence (in the same , Chelsea have gone through 19 bosses).The Observer is the world\u0027s oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791. It is published by Guardian News \u0026amp Media and is editorially independent.Wenger’s decision to call time on that £8m-a-year association last week could at least be presented as a final typically crafty bit of strategy. It was, perhaps, the last possible moment in which he could leave on his own terms. Measured in league position, this will be Wenger’s worst ever performance – Arsenal seem likely to finish sixth. But there is still the chance of the single achievement that has eluded the French coach in his long career – he may yet add a European trophy, albeit the second-string Europa League, to a cabinet that boasts three Premier League titles and a remarkable seven FA Cups. As with any true sportsman, he will like the fact that his leaving remains in the balance between bang and whimper.Either way, that last act will not disguise the fact that Wenger’s legacy goes way beyond trophies. Almost unknown when he arrived in north London in 1996, he inspirationally transformed not only Arsenal’s hard-bitten style, but also the idea of what football might be in England. More than any other inidual, he imagined the Premier League as the extraordinary global drama that it has become.Born in the ultimate no-man’s-land of Alsace, Wenger did much to create football that no longer recognised borders. He intuitively integrated different nationalities into his Arsenal team not only Europeans but, crucially, players of African heritage.With the application of groundbreaking sports science and a will to win matched only by his great rival, Alex Ferguson, his best teams married strength of purpose with an exhilarating freedom of expression. “The professor” described his sense of that task in terms that sounded wonderfully alien to the “up and at ’em” traditions of the English game: “My never-ending struggle in this business is to release what is beautiful in man.”That devotion to principled virtue – he favours the word “integrity” – in a shifting world awash with money, inevitably proved both Wenger’s triumph and his downfall. The certainty of his aesthetic vision of what football might be reached its high point with his unbeaten “invincibles” season in 2004. After that, as with any self-styled tragic hero, his purity of purpose began to look like a fatal flaw. No audiences are as restlessly demanding as modern football fans. Although reason dictates that only one Premier League team can triumph, and economics shows that it is invariably the club with the deepest pockets, merely consistent high achievement invariably translates on the phone-ins as “a lack of ambition”.Wenger’s singular efforts to “release what is beautiful” have more often in recent years unleashed what is ugly in a section of Arsenal’s supporters – their former messiah has been subject to predictable tides of personal abuse on and offline. Wenger’s response has been a mix of superhuman intransigence and an occasional raised Gallic eyebrow at the extremes of English anger. He has no doubt known for a while that the end was coming – but also that history argues that his detractors should be careful what they wished for."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/add3f5b4829d01265e47e9a6e35573c0f8bf58ec/0_77_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ee0d366c4255a3ead09c47ca2355261","title":"tammie jo shults a hero long before saving 148 lives flight 1380","story":"If Julia Roberts isn’t already on the phone about playing her in a movie, I’d be amazedAfter one of its engines appeared to explode in midair, a flight from New York to Dallas ended terribly and tragically with the death of a passenger, Jennifer Riordan, who had been partially sucked out of a broken window. The horror is unimaginable.It’s the nightmarish worst-case scenario that is never supposed to happen, the stuff of disaster movies, not real life. But the pilot of Southwest Airlines flight 1380, Captain Tammie Jo Shults, landed the plane calmly and successfully, on just one engine, at a Philadelphia airport, saving the lives of 148 people. Riordan’s death was awful the fact that the incident wasn’t even more deadly was extraordinary.When Captain Chesley Sullenberger brought US Airways Flight 1549 down on to the Hudson river in 2009, after geese took out both engines, he was lauded as a hero. Tom Hanks played him in a Clint Eastwood-directed biopic, Sully, which seems about as all-American an endorsement of courage and bravery as it’s possible to get. Sully offered his approval of Shults last week, and of the teamwork of the flight crew that saved so many lives, although cautioned that, in his experience, the trauma would long outlast any fuss or attention.Those present recalled that after the plane had landed, Shults walked through the aisle to talk to them, to see how they were doing. One passenger, Alfred Tumlinson, told reporters that he would send the pilot “a Christmas card, I’m going to tell you that, with a gift certificate for getting me on the ground. She was awesome.” News outlets have delved into her life story and it has turned out to be astonishing. Shults was one of the first female fighter pilots in the US Navy and was elite enough to fly an FA-18 Hornet. She flew training missions as an “enemy pilot” during Operation Desert Storm, as women were then still excluded from combat missions.A Navy spokesman, Commander Ron Flanders, explained to Time magazine that she helped “male pilots hone their skills”. She left active duty just before restrictions on female pilots entering combat were lifted. If Julia Roberts isn’t already on the phone, I’d be amazed.When reading about flight 1380, any references to Shults’s gender have seemed to me to be entirely beside the point. When reports have described her as “a female pilot”, I have winced a little, instinctively. It’s the muscle memory that accompanies phrases such as “female comedian” or “female doctor”. She’s a pilot. That’s it. But equally, to learn about her past, in which being a woman made it harder for her to do what she did, makes it worth just a moment of added recognition of her incredible life and career."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e81c39d95fcabec7744faa4a67c5f6a5b57b208/100_169_2241_1345/master/2241.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e5822a9862fd18831176fff11172788","title":"treasure the london marathon","story":"Holding an arcane running world record gives the writer a rare insight into the eventOver the past year, I have run all of these world marathon majors: London, Berlin, Chicago, New York, Tokyo and Boston. In fact, I am a world record holder – albeit of the obscure record of running this full set of six (known as the Abbott World Marathon Majors) with a faster combined time than anyone else has run as a single series (an average of two hours, 41 minutes per marathon).But, like the other people who will run wacky world records in the London race today, including those in costume, the primary goal was not to set the record but to use the run as a means to raise money and awareness. (In my case, for an Oxford-based refugee charity, Asylum Welcome.)Each of the “majors” has its advantages: Berlin is fast, Boston requires time qualification, New York goes through five boroughs. But on several metrics London stands out as the best. It has more applications than any other race in the world, raises more money for charity and attracts more of the top-level runners. From Greenwich to Tower Bridge and on to Westminster, its carnival atmosphere is unsurpassed.In my day job, I focus on refugees and immigration. In the aftermath of the so-called European refugee crisis, migration was among the most salient and isive issues in the Brexit vote and in other European elections. This is one of many areas in which the marathon can play an important unifying role. At a time when the country is ided and British identity is contested, the marathon is a example of something we do together outstandingly. It deserves to be celebrated as such.From a sporting perspective, this year’s event has the potential to be one of the greatest marathons in history. The men’s race will pit Mo Farah against Eliud Kipchoge and Kenenisa Bekele, arguably the two best distance runners in the world. Both of them have a shot at breaking the world record. In the women’s race, Mary Keitxany will attempt to break Paula Radcliffe’s longstanding women’s world record.London, though, matters for reasons that go beyond elite competition. Hugh Brasher, the race director, is correct to claim that “since 1981, the London Marathon has been an extraordinary force for good that has inspired profound social change”.These impacts are arguably more important today than ever. The Brexit referendum revealed deep isions in our society, based on geography, age and social class. As across the western world, there is a profound ide between those who embrace globalisation and those who fear it. It might seem a grand claim, but the London Marathon reconciles some of these tensions. It combines outward-looking internationalism with deep community engagement. It exemplifies how working inclusively across national boundaries can bring local benefits – echoes of my day job.The most obvious contribution of the race is its role in charitable fundraising. Last year’s race raised £65.1m, more than any other marathon. It set an 11th straight world record for a single-day charity fundraising event.But fundraising is just one aspect of the marathon’s social impact. There is also important symbolism, which comes from the event’s inclusive nature. Today, the viewing public will be firmly behind Mo Farah. He strongly self-identifies as British, but we should not forget that he arrived as a refugee from Somalia. And there are other examples: Ethiopian Olympian Feyisa Lilesa lives in exile in Arizona, having crossed his arms in an “X” shape as he finished the Rio Olympics marathon in solidarity with the oppressed Oromo people. Former London winner Tegla Loroupe served as chef de mission of the refugee team at the Rio Olympics.More generally, one remarkable feature of marathons is that they level the playing field, albeit temporarily. A 26.2 mile run has no respect for wealth, social class, race, nationality or immigration status. All that matters is speed, endurance and character. The ubiquitous marathon image of Kenyans and Ethiopians leading the race subverts global economic hierarchies. People from all backgrounds participate in an event in which black east Africans are celebrated as the best in the world.And London is profoundly inclusive. It may only have 40,000 places to offer but they are equitably distributed. The marathon is one of the few sports in which amateurs can play in the same field as global superstars – the equivalent to being able to wander on to the pitch at Wembley and join in. The majority of places go to British residents, but they are from all walks of life. There are races within the race, including the British national championships and even the Oxford-Cambridge varsity marathon.The race consistently generates inspiring stories that defy the odds. Last year, amateur Josh Griffiths caught up with the elites to finish 13th and qualify for the world championships. Meanwhile, Swansea Harriers athlete Matthew Rees stopped 300 metres from the end to help struggling Chorlton Runners’ athlete David Wyeth to cross the line. This year, 87-year-old John Starbrook will be the oldest runner, participating in his 33rd London Marathon. And at a time when it is most needed, the London Marathon highlights so much of what Britain can be – a country of inclusivity, tolerance and solidarity.Alexander Betts is professor of forced migration and international affairs at the University of Oxford"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84de40058b04d132bd695998d1b807b8f4c8a218/0_251_3364_2018/master/3364.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6581385cf270abb6f37873cd3d051ba","title":"romola garai cultural highlights lincoln bardo st vincent viv albertine","story":"Actor Romola Garai grew up in Hong Kong and Singapore before moving to Wiltshire aged eight.

She has been nominated for two Golden Globes and a Bafta. She stars in Ella Hickson’s new play The Writer, directed by Blanche McIntyre, at the Almeida theatre, London, until 26 May.Lincoln in the Bardo by George SaundersI thought this was a completely sublime piece of writing. It’s really rare and hard to do something playful with form that isn’t excruciating for the reader. He did challenging things with language and multiple voices, but I never felt like I was being asked to do something that was impossible for me. I found it unbearably moving, obviously, because of the subject matter: it’s about the loss of a child, told through the perspective of a lot of people watching a famous man go through extreme grief. I was in bits at the end.I’m from the West Country, so this is very funny to me. It’s very grounded in place: Daisy May Cooper and her brother Charlie, who wrote the comedy, both live there, so it wasn’t someone from a city writing about the countryside. What I like about the show is you get the sense that, yes, there’s not a lot to do, and you do feel like an outsider because everything has become so metropolitan-centric – but there’s also a lot of humour and joy in that, because actually that’s just the way all people feel, like they’re not the ones at the party.I’ve been a big fan of St Vincent since her album Marry Me in 2007. On her new album, Masseduction, there’s a single, New York, and every time I listen to it it absolutely tears me apart, it’s so beautiful. There’s something innately powerful about a woman being on stage with a guitar. And she has embraced that in a completely unafraid-of-being-sexy way, which is very inspiring to a lot of women who feel it’s hard to do that and not be part of the male gaze.This is pretty much my favourite thing in the whole world – I’ve been an avid fan for years, and even embarrassingly have T-shirts and tote bags. They had an episode recently called Five Women, which was a really extraordinary piece of journalism, where one of their writers deconstructed five women’s experiences of working with a man. I thought it was a fantastic understanding of the complexities and difficulties of shared male and female work space, which has been in the public imagination recently. I really recommend it.To Throw Away Unopened by Viv AlbertineI haven’t read this yet, but her first book, Clothes, Clothes, Clothes. Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys, is probably the best memoir I’ve ever read. She was a punk, and it was extraordinary for me to read about an era I feel so apart from. I was a child of the 80s and consumerism, and it’s hard for me to imagine what it was like to live in the 70s… the freedom, the courage they needed to be on stage and dress that way. She writes amazingly about being a woman of that time and how profoundly they were threatening men.This was on at the Orange Tree in Richmond and is coming to the National in June. It was an astonishing piece of theatre, talking about race in an incredibly bold way. It’s a weird, postmodern adaptation of a 19th-century play, and basically a lot of the characters, including the black actors, assume blackface. It’s difficult, because the original was trying to be an anti-slavery play but traded a lot on racial stereotypes. So it’s asking you to look at that, and at appropriation. I think no one could go and not get something out of it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7726b621fc69001134046e888ac3da5e7b66529/0_45_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=535d31e607f6c9415f6a187918675fbe","title":"parents boycott sats tests","story":"When children across England start their week of Sats tests next month, 30 primary schools will be under particular scrutiny. That is because children from those schools have performed poorly once they have moved to secondary schools. That has raised suspicions that their good Sats results – more properly known as key stage 2 tests – were the result of cheating. Children from other primary schools feeding the same secondary schools, meanwhile, have performed roughly as expected.Cheating is one of the many reasons why Sats continue to face serious opposition. Parent groups such as Let Our Kids Be Kids plan to boycott Sats this year by taking their children out of primary school when the tests start on 14 May. Last year a headteacher of a Leeds primary school locked the Sats papers in a cupboard and took the children to the Captain Cook Museum in Whitby instead. In 2010 nearly 15,000 children in London did not take Sats after a boycott and had continuous assessments instead.Campaigners against Sats object to the huge pressure primary schools are under to deliver improvements year after year, which they say encourages schools to teach only the core subjects of reading, writing and mathematics, almost abandoning art, music, foreign languages and even science, which is only assessed in a random selection of schools.“Schools are judged, compared and ranked on these results,” said James Bowen from the National Association of Head Teachers.“If the scores aren’t good enough, teachers start fearing the implications and the interventions they might face – even the future of the school. The stakes are far too high.”Those stakes are high enough for some teachers to risk their careers. Over the last 12 months, three headteachers have been taken to a disciplinary panel of the National College for Training and Leadership – now the Teaching Regulation Agency – for altering Sats papers after they had been completed. In each case the heads resigned or were dismissed.A National Union of Teachers source told the Observer that in other cases, borderline pupils had done Sats in the headteacher’s office so they could be helped to get the right answers. “Another head prepared for a mental maths test by giving all the children a copy of the paper so they could see the questions,” the source said. “There was a teacher who read the multiple choice test aloud and emphasised the right answers. One pressed so hard when she was altering exam scripts that the marks came through on other papers in the pile underneath.“Those numbers are an overwhelming minority of cases,” Bowen said. “You have to question what is going on with the system where people feel driven to that kind of behaviour. No one trains to be a teacher thinking ‘one day I’m going to cheat in tests’. It says something about the system where people feel under so much pressure they start taking questionable action.”While the vast majority of the 15,000 primary schools in England do not cheat, Sats are still seen by some as disruptive. Little London primary school in Leeds decided to boycott the exams last year after parents backed the idea in a consultation, says Ivelina Metchkarova, whose son was in year six. The key factor was that school would continue as normal in the remaining eight weeks of term after Sats finished.“We were told that if there are no Sats, but there are extra assessments, then there will be continuous learning throughout the year until July,” she said. “If there had been Sats, after they finished the school would have been putting on plays. My son learned a huge amount in those three months and it really built his confidence.”Unlike GCSEs and A-levels, Sats have no bearing on a child’s future – they aren’t used for school selection, and primary schools send far more detailed assessments of each child when they move up to secondary level. Yet there is growing concern that the stress felt by teachers trickles down to the children. The Commons education committee said last year that young children were at risk of developing mental health problems, with evidence that growing numbers of children suffering from panic attacks, anxiety and depression.Alison Roy of the Association of Child Psychotherapists, which is part of the More Than A Score campaign group seeking to replace Sats, said it was common now to hear children as young as six say they feel “stressed out”.Madeleine Holt, More Than A Score’s spokeswoman, said it wanted to see a broader range of assessments.“In Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales they don’t do this. In New Zealand they got rid of them,” she said, referring to the National Standards tests that have been abolished.“The driving motive behind More Than A Score is to show that we are an international outlier. Most countries don’t do this. More and more parents are starting to feel that something is going wrong.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8daf9ccd1c1129aa415c631aa14550f16d4528d3/0_207_5175_3106/master/5175.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32854f6dba5105cdd4924f3c57d59dc7","title":"how to avoid clothes moths live in the east midlands","story":"Survey suggests pest problem is worst in south-east England, and in flats and pre-1950s housingGot a lovely collection of cashmere sweaters you don’t want devoured by moths? Then maybe you should move to a new-build house in the east Midlands. That, you see, is the type of dwelling and region least likely to be tormented by the pesky insects, according to a new study by English Heritage at least.English Heritage conservators have been monitoring the remorseless rise in moth numbers, blamed on a string of exceptionally mild winters – although the survey ended before the spectacularly bitter weather of last winter – and last year invited visitors to their properties to help by collecting free moth traps and reporting their haul.More than 5,000 traps were distributed across 42 counties – compared with the 11 sites English Heritage had been monitoring. The results will not be news to anyone living in the south-east of England, where supermarkets stock an array of moth remedies of dubious effectiveness. In London and the south-east each trap caught an average of 23 moths, while it was just three in the east Midlands.The south-west took second place, with 17 per trap, closely followed by the West Midlands with 16.The conservators are particularly concerned about the dramatic increase in a particularly destructive species known as the pale-backed clothes moth. The traps set by the public produced a haul of 460 of the insects, compared with 15 caught on the English Heritage sites.The results also suggest that flats, with shared walls between properties, and pre-1950s houses with more voids, fireplaces and attics than modern houses, are the most likely to be affected.Amber Xavier-Rowe, head of collections conservation, said the help from the public had been invaluable. “Now that we know where the clothes moth concentration is the highest, we can put in place extra measures to ensure that our historic houses in these areas are fully protected and preserved for future generations. We wouldn’t have been able to do that without the public’s help,” she said. “Operation Clothes Moth has really resonated with a lot of people who, yes, want to help us protect our collections but also to protect their favourite woolly jumpers.” English Heritage has collated its advice into a book published this week, which advocates a daunting housekeeping routine, including checking the undersides of chairs, moving and vacuuming under all furniture once a month – and emptying the contents of the machine and sealing the rubbish bag each time – taking all clothes out of wardrobes and checking and shaking them once a month, and regularly checking attics and chimneys. When prevention has failed, adults, eggs and larvae can be killed by placing garments in sealed bags and freezing them for a fortnight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c4c911393d1135f25adb297b65eb1c505a7c41c/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0198ad103fb16f12ae85851724c0b88","title":"blue blooms matisse is having a fashion moment this spring","story":"Sixty-four years after his death, the French artist is this season’s style inspirationIn Dior’s spring 2018 campaign, a model poses on a floor marked with flowing black line drawings of idealised faces. You can’t mistake the origin of these designs – Henri Matisse. Of course, these sketches are not actually by Matisse, any more than JW Anderson’s Moon Face earrings or Victoria Beckham’s Fluid shirt (which sold out quickly upon their autumn release) were designed by the man who painted the blazingly carnal Dance in 1910. In fact, Dior’s collection was inspired by the artist Niki de Saint Phalle, with references to her brightly coloured sculptures and mirror mosaics featuring heavily throughout. The overall takeaway from the brand’s SS18 advertising campaign, however, was pure Matisse. Because, 64 years after he died, the French artist is having a fashion moment.No modern artist has been as unapologetically sensual as Matisse. It is hard to know where to begin when drawing parallels between his purified abstract art of pleasure and the aesthetic boldness of modern fashion because there are so many threads in the weave. To start with the most obvious, though: colour. The Dior clothes mingling with those Matisse-like drawings include nocturnal blues that might be seen by a er looking up through moonlit waters. In another example of the Matisse wave, the blue and pearl ovals of Annie Costello Brown’s Skye Earrings resemble the night sky. All these aqua hues echo one of the most intense masterpieces of poetic colour that Matisse ever painted, his 1913 canvas The Blue Window.The depths of colour into which Matisse can e are, in fact, related to his own interest in fashion and fabrics. Born in 1869 in Picardy, northern France, where traditions of powerfully coloured textile weaving go back to the middle ages, he collected brightly coloured rugs and hangings all his life, especially from north Africa, and used them to create a private world of utopian rapture in his studio. You see the magic colours of these textiles, especially in his 20s paintings of models in rich interiors, which also show his eye for fashion: in Odalisque With Red Culottes (1921) he has his bare-breasted model show off a pair of opulent baggy pants.Matisse enjoyed fashion, so why shouldn’t fashion enjoy Matisse? Yet the current vogue is not so much about copying his culottes as putting on his masks. All these moon-faced earrings and floor drawings of haughtily gorgeous people are directly descended from the way Matisse reinvented the human face when he painted a portrait of his wife, Amélie, in 1913.It was the time when modern artists were looking at African masks in Paris’s Musée d’Ethnographie du Trocadero and enthusiastically collecting them. Picasso saw savagery and terror in these masks. Matisse saw cool beauty. In his portrait of Mme Matisse he gives her a mask-like face with mysterious black eyes, carving her features into a regular, symmetrical ovoid shape – a moon face, even. That mask-like perfecting of the human face was to become an obsession in his art that culminated in a superbly pure oval gazer among the dreamy coloured cut-outs he created in his last years.He drew faces with a relaxed freedom that is itself part of the new Matisse mood. Why not fill space with lines that mean something, as Matisse did in his idyllic drawings and cut-outs? At the Oscars, veteran film-maker James Ivory sported a shirt with the face of Timothée Chalamet, star of his film Call Me By Your Name, portrayed on it, with Matisse-like sensuality, by the British artist Andrew Mania.That same romanticism wafts through all the hints and echoes of Matisse that are drifting gracefully through the fashion world.For Matisse is not some cold decorative artist. He is a hot, passionate one, forever chasing a beauty so extreme it could shatter reality and replace it with a dream. Surely fashion is another way of chasing that dream. Those Matisse earrings and that Matisse shirt are fragments of the utopia his art creates, in which body and soul become one. Or if that’s too heady, let’s just say that by imagining the human face as a godlike mask, Matisse created a truly democratic ideal of beauty – democratic because it’s heavenly.

They will be erected in places ranging from Brighton beach to the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh.A former actor, Wood set up his company a decade ago, initially as a hobby to tide him through the summer when acting jobs were scarce.“I’d been to Australia and seen an open-air screen out there and thought: what a brilliant idea. I remember saying to my Aussie mates, why don’t we do this in England? And they all said, at the same time, ‘because your weather’s shit, mate’!”Undeterred, Wood hired a small screen and showed Some Like it Hot at Dulwich Park in south London. To everyone’s surprise – not least the council that gave him the permit – 500 people turned up to watch Tony Curtis woo Marilyn Monroe.Wood, who only days before had broken his leg in a moped accident, says he was hobbling around on crutches and thinking, “My God, this is it, this is what I’m going to do.”He says: “People thought that open-air cinema would be a fad, just one of those London things that wouldn’t transfer elsewhere. Actually, it’s the provinces that have been the real success story. It turns out that people in Lincoln love Top Gun as much as anyone in London.”David Cox, programmer for the Film4 summer screen season at Somerset House in central London, insists outdoor cinema is much more than just singalongs and crowd-pleasers.His “dreams”-themed summer programme includes David Lynch’s Blue Velvet and Christopher Nolan’s Inception, but such is the demand for the outdoor “live cinema experience”, as he calls it, that he expects to fill the 2,000-capacity courtyard every night.And it is not just Hollywood films on offer. Thanks to new hi-tech LED screens that work under direct sunlight, events such as Wimbledon, the football World Cup and the royal wedding will also be streamed live and alfresco.The phenomenon has also opened up the lucrative children’s market, with a series of daytime family programming planned for this year, featuring films such as Paddington 2 and Coco.Richard Cope, a trends expert at Mintel, thinks the booming popularity of outdoor cinema is because people are hankering for “old-fashioned communal viewing experiences”. He says: “It’s the American drive-in concept but done in a modern guise. People are so used to consuming media on their phones and iPads, there’s a natural craving for this kind of decompressed experience – where there’s loads of space, where you can react together, where you’re not just watching something on your own and tweeting about it.”Cope believes outdoor cinema works well for musicals and “scary” films, where groups of friends can chat and drink while watching. But the constant hum can be a “massive distraction” for arthouse movies, such as Blade Runner.“If you think about it,” says Cox, “it’s quite a vulnerable situation to be in. You don’t know what the weather’s going to do, there are no armrests to separate you from whoever you’re sitting next to, so people are putting their trust in each other – I think that makes them even more susceptible to watching a film and feeling it in a deeper way.“And then there is the beauty of being outside on a summer’s night. It’s a very different experience from what people might expect.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3e139f72ebc36d3f4eb7a07b140a323de9d4df5/0_8_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51b4481a0d719be9c782efb559d624ab","title":"verne troyer austin powers mini me cult star dignity and good humour","story":"Troyer, who has died aged 49, famously incarnated Mike Myers’ clone Mini-Me in Austin Powers, and was at the forefront of pop culture’s modern challenge to bigotry“I shall call him … Mini-Me!” This was how Verne Troyer was brought on to the screen, and into the world of cult stardom: a world which was part cruel, part affectionate. It was in the 1999 movie Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. Mike Myers’s Dr Evil has just been cloned, and does a convulsive double-take on realising that his double is one-eighth his size. Two-foot-eight Troyer comes on in the Bond-villain quasi-Nehru jacket and impassively does the signature little finger to the lips move – worryingly like a precocious infant. An almost-star was born, although Troyer had begun his screen career in 1994 in the movie Baby’s Day Out when he had been the stunt double for a baby. Troyer repeated the Mini-Me role in the Austin Powers sequel Goldmember, had a small part as a goblin in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone – and with dignity and good humour sustained a career in reality television and the professional celebrity industry for almost 20 years.This career ned a period in which people of restricted height – Troyer had achondroplasia dwarfism – were starting to be regarded differently in cinema and in pop culture. People with dwarfism had always been treated exploitatively, and cinema from its earliest days adopted the robust circus tradition of using them brashly, unsentimentally, and expected them to behave in the same matter-of-fact way. And for many that was at least better than condescending pity. Tales of the Munchkin actors’ drunken behaviour on the set of The Wizard of Oz became legendary.Kenny Baker found his weird vocation in playing R2D2 in Star Wars. Felix Silla was an Italian circus clown who had work in comedies and scary movies (an habitual generic combination for actors with dwarfism). Zelda Rubinstein made an impression in Chevy Chase’s 1980 comedy Under the Rainbow, a 30s-period comedy, set at the time of the filming of The Wizard of Oz. British actor David Rappaport had a very similar career, but was given a chance to shine more than usual in Terry Gilliam’s Time Bandits (1981). But it was Peter Dinklage, Game of Thrones star, who has really escaped the patronising prejudice in a very contemporary way. He has stated that “dwarfs are still the butt of jokes. It’s one of the last bastions of acceptable prejudice.” It was a bigotry that his career has repudiated, although Troyer arguably couldn’t match Dinklage’s acting talent.In a way, Warwick Davis’s career is closer to Troyer’s: he acted in the first Star Wars prequel Phantom Menace and, ironically, replaced him in the Harry Potter franchise, but it was archly playing himself in Ricky Gervais’s TV comedy Extras that made Davis’ name. Davis challenged bigotry with confidence and black comedy, breaking the hush of liberal concern, and that was the same cheerful self-awareness that Troyer tapped into. There is an ongoing debate about the whole idea of “mini-me”: the idea that performers with dwarfism are just being demeaningly represented as comic or horrific miniatures. But Troyer at any rate tackled and subverted that idea — with confidence, with comic gusto and with charm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d76d89edc88d7c902e5961f751cc848478c067e/678_209_2318_1391/master/2318.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02f6057a1a7f0a1aad5ede7a729ae8c9","title":"verne troyer life in pictures","story":"Verne Troyer, who at 2ft 8in was one of the world’s shortest men, racked up 30 film credits in a career ning 24 years"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/146752e5871eaa1f995fe6190181cd04c22a4948/208_68_2515_1509/master/2515.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=197cd16c127f672a31446214c4e7d868","title":"arsenal west ham united premier league match report","story":"Until the final 10 minutes of this match, with Arsenal being held and Arsène Wenger standing anxiously on the touchline, it was tempting to wonder whether a few supporters might even be impertinent enough to boo the team off. The score was 1-1, West Ham were holding their own and Arsenal were heading towards a result that would have made it mathematically impossible to reach the top four and meant a second successive season behind Tottenham Hotspur for the first time since 1983.Unfortunately for Wenger, what followed will only be delaying the inevitable when his team are still 11 points adrift of the leading pack and, staggeringly, 30 adrift of the top, little more than a speck in Manchester City’s wing-mirrors. Yet that three-goal blitz did at least ensure a happy ending to the first game since Wenger announced he is cutting his ties with the club he has served with distinction – mostly, anyway – for 22 years.In the process, Arsenal warmed up nicely for the first leg of their Europa League semi-final against Atlético Madrid, the only downside being the first-half injury to Mohamed Elneny that led to the Egyptian being taken off on a stretcher and could also threaten his participation in the World Cup.Alexandre Lacazette scored twice in the late drama but the key moment came in the 82nd minute when Aaron Ramsey crossed from the left and a terrible mix-up between Declan Rice and Joe Hart led to the West Ham centre-half and his goalkeeper leaving the ball to each other. The ball went between them both to bounce into the net and Lacazette’s quick one-two, in the 85th and 89th minutes, lifted the volume by a few more notches.Not that this could be described as the Wenger love-in that might have been anticipated. That, above all, was the strangest part of the afternoon. Where were the banners thanking him for everything? Where were the loud chants to make it clear this was not just a normal occasion? Wenger took his seat to mild applause and, briefly, some of the fans behind his dugout serenaded him. Only a small number, though. Then the game kicked off and it was not until just before the hour, once Nacho Monreal had given Arsenal the lead, that we heard his name being sung with any volume. The atmosphere at other times, just like the man’s cardigan, was grey and low-key.Perhaps those of us who expected it to be different, emotional even, had underestimated the apathy that has engulfed the Emirates Stadium this season. The banners here pay tribute to “Old Trafford ’02”, the Invincibles season – “P38 W26 D12 L0” – and many of the other highlights from the Wenger years. Yet it was a mistake to think the news of his abdication might tempt back some of the thousands who have stayed away. Again, there were vast expanses of empty red seats. “Merci Arsène” read the front cover of the programme. That apart, however, there was nothing to distinguish this from any other Arsenal match bar the swarm of television crews, a couple of hours before kick-off, conducting vox pops on the roundabout outside the Little Wonder Cafe.At least nobody was impertinent enough to be too grumpy when half-time came with the game goalless but it would have been intriguing to see how the mood might have shifted had Marko Arnautovic or João Mário been able to exploit the gaps in Arsenal’s defence during the opening exchanges. West Ham began encouragingly and could also reflect on the moment in the first half when Cheikhou Kouyaté’s looping header landed on the top of the crossbar.After that, however, there was a long period when David Moyes’s team lost their momentum. Arsenal finished the first half strongly and when Monreal volleyed in Granit Xhaka’s corner six minutes after the interval there was a 10-minute spell when the home side were threatening to add more goals until West Ham, on the counterattack, levelled through Arnautovic.Kouyaté had the first shot but when the ball ricocheted off a defender it went straight back to the West Ham player. Manuel Lanzini, a substitute, took over possession and Arnautovic had managed to find a couple of yards of space inside the penalty area. He was shooting at an angle, on his left foot with a number of opponents closing in, but it was an emphatic finish to put the ball past David Ospina.At 1-1, Hart made a wonderful one-handed save to deny Daniel Welbeck but it must have been alarming for Moyes to see what happened in the 82nd minute. Rice has to accept the culpability after ducking down to avoid Ramsey’s cross. Hart had been expecting his colleague to head it clear. The communication was poor, to say the least, and once Arsenal had retaken the lead Lacazette’s two penalty-box finishes applied some sheen to the final result."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dbbc395b8ea3ef00a886c256f19694b6dd89860/0_109_3649_2189/master/3649.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b290e0a22c85a0d82368aacf2c0e717","title":"chelsea southampton fa cup semi final match report","story":"For Chelsea, a season that has underwhelmed could yet yield major silverware. Antonio Conte was back to his animated best on the touchline at the national stadium as his side, inspired by Olivier Giroud’s wonderfully pilfered opening goal and Eden Hazard’s effervescence, eased past Southampton to secure their passage to a second successive FA Cup final.For a while it was as if the Italian’s grouchy recent demeanour had been washed away, his club’s support bellowing his name in joyous celebration with all the uninspired displays on the pitch, and the political grumblings off it, briefly forgotten. Conte and his players are intent on making amends for last season’s defeat against Arsenal in the final. Manchester United, and José Mourinho, await here next month. If the Italian is to leave in the summer, as is widely expected, then he could still do so with a bang.Giroud had scored twice against these opponents in the Premier League just eight days ago, the visitors conjuring an unlikely three-goal comeback in the last 20 minutes at St Mary’s, so there was a certain inevitability he would scar Southampton again. He had enjoyed the occasional glimpse of goal in the opening period, invariably from Hazard’s deliveries, but would make his mark more emphatically 30\u0026nbspseconds after the interval. Cesc Fàbregas’ lofted pass forward had been optimistic, but Hazard collected on the volley in mid-air ahead of Jan Bednarek and, once grounded, kept his head to flick the loose ball towards the penalty spot where Giroud had evaded Mario Lemina in anticipation of a pass.The composure demonstrated thereafter by the Frenchman, in the tightest of spaces with markers flinging themselves in from all around, was startling. A touch with his left foot took the ball away from Maya Yoshida, a second with his right cutting back outside to bypass Cédric Soares as he slid in. By the time the striker had calmly flicked in his finish with the outside of his right foot as he stumbled, Alex McCarthy and Bednarek had joined Cédric prone on the turf in the goalmouth. The whole exchange had been played out at pace, the forward’s control and subtlety of touch too much for Southampton’s backline.The reward had been coming. Chelsea were the more progressive team throughout the first half, with their brighter moments usually conjured by Hazard. The Belgian was back to his livewire best, all spins into space and elegant close control as he scuttled at back-tracking opponents. He had left Lemina on the turf early on before belting a shot just over the bar would later be denied from close-range by Yoshida’s recovery challenge and would test McCarthy from long-range in the latter stages. It was Hazard’s gallop through the middle, and his perfectly weighted pass behind Wesley Hoedt, that liberated Willian inside the opening 10 minutes. The Brazilian, cutting back infield, curled a shot that kissed the top of the crossbar. Giroud would be more ruthless from closer in.The concession demanded a response from Southampton, a team whose chances of survival in the Premier League diminish with each passing weekend and whose attacking intent had been cautious at best up to then. In truth, they should have prospered almost immediately, Hoedt’s diagonal pass freeing Shane Long through the middle with Charlie Austin’s dummy having disorientated Chelsea’s rearguard. Yet the Irishman’s first touch was wastefully heavy, betraying a striker with two goals to his name in 49 appearances for club and country. He was still cursing the miss when summoned from the pitch moments later.Mark Hughes’ introduction of Nathan Redmond and Dusan Tadic at least injected more energy into Southampton’s approach and, as the game became far more frenetic in the latter stages, the threat of an equaliser briefly loomed large. Willy Caballero, initially wrong-footed, did wonderfully well to deflect Redmond’s shot from distance behind as he fell. He was far less convincing from the resultant corner, spilling a high ball over the line under pressure from Austin only to be saved – somewhat fortunately – by the referee’s whistle. When the goalkeeper was beaten, six minutes from the end, Chelsea breathed a sigh of relief after Austin’s attempt back across goal from beyond the far post struck the woodwork and bobbled away.Yet, by then, the tie appeared to have been settled. Álvaro Morata had only been the pitch a few minutes when César Azpilicueta gathered in space and flung over the kind of cross from which successive Chelsea forwards have prospered in recent times. Morata had eased away far too comfortably from Hoedt and his downward header bounced up and into the net with McCarthy aghast. Hoedt’s strange mishmash of a performance would at least end with a goal-line clearance to deny Morata a second, but by then it mattered little. For the second year in succession, Chelsea’s season will culminate in an appearance at the FA Cup final. The chance for Conte to go out on a high remains."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7e06b40b89bbf1b795ba23f671994e05939f214/0_78_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64489d9dd77d70682fd2eaddf9f96d20","title":"eusebio di francesco roma liverpool champions league","story":"Words race out of Eusebio Di\u0026nbspFrancesco’s mouth like cars entering il\u0026nbspGra, the orbital motorway that encircles the city of Rome. They are going a mile a minute, bumper to bumper, yet the man behind the wheel somehow finds a way to transmit an overwhelming sense of calm.Roma’s manager speaks fast because this is no time to drop a gear following his team’s return to their Trigoria training base after a vital league win away at Spal. They have barely one day here before they pack up again and fly to Liverpool for the first leg of their Champions League semi-final.Roma began this weekend third, just a point clear of Internazionale in fifth. The game against Liverpool will be their eighth in 25 days, a stretch that has included not only a two-legged quarter-final with Barcelona but also a draining derby against a Lazio side fighting to leapfrog them in the table.If this team is running close to empty, you would not know it from the grins on players’ faces as they arrive for training. “What we do is a job but it needs to be fun, too,” says Di\u0026nbspFrancesco. “It should be a joy. That’s what I always say to the lads. The first thought is to prepare to enjoy ourselves together, and work hard. They have to enjoy themselves. This is a game first of all.”That lesson was learned during Di\u0026nbspFrancesco’s own playing career. As a member of the Roma team that won the Scudetto in 2001 – only the third in their club’s history – what he remembers above all is the way that he and his team-mates used to spend time together off the pitch, hanging out to play cards or shoot\u0026nbsppool.He does not see great similarities between that team and this one. “Because these are completely different times. There’s a greater professionality now, as there should be, but back then there was more of a family spirit. That’s been lost a little bit, with social media, with technology, with the arrival of new ways of working. If those two things could come together, that would be the ideal. And we are trying here to make it so.”That he thinks a great deal about players’ psychology is obvious. After Roma overturned a three-goal deficit in the second leg of their quarter-final against Barcelona, pundits rushed to acclaim his tactical nous, switching for the first time to a three-man defence: some move for a man who has always insisted that 4-3-3 is the “ideal formation”.Yet Di Francesco frames the change differently. “Football is dynamic,” he asserts. “Even when you talk about a four-man defence, you often end up defending as a three, or even a two, depending on the game situation.“My decision to change the system was linked to the fact that with some teams, with the characteristics of certain players, a three-man defence can give you a little bit of extra physicality. You get a little bit of extra strength – some of that just in the heads of the players themselves. Sometimes, especially in Europe, you need a little bit more physicality.”That was certainly the case against Barcelona, bullied into submission by Roma’s muscular midfield trio of Radja Nainggolan, Kevin Strootman and Daniele De Rossi. Does Di Francesco plan to repeat the ruse against Liverpool? He would hardly tell us if he did, yet he does observe that Jürgen Klopp’s team are a long way from the old English stereotype of long-balls and reducers.Appointed last summer, Di\u0026nbspFrancesco never had a chance to work with Mohamed Salah. If there is any regret at missing out on the chance to coach such a talent, then he hides it well, though he does note his players’ praise for “a great guy, a great professional, a hard worker”.“I don’t need them to tell me,” he says with a smile when asked if he has sought out advice from his defenders on how best to frustrate Salah. “His qualities are very clear. Don’t forget that I prepared games against him in Italy, too. But the fact lots of our players know him well, that can be an advantage.”Salah has scored 41 goals this season, yet it was his assists last year at Roma that helped Edin Dzeko to reach 39. The Bosnian has a more modest 20 this time around, and Di\u0026nbspFrancesco offers frankly that “he has alternated good matches with not-so-good ones”. The good, though, have been very good indeed. He notched a double at Stamford Bridge and scored in both legs against Barcelona.Does it surprise Di\u0026nbspFrancesco that Manchester City would let go of a player so capable of taking the biggest games in hand? “It seems to me Guardiola loves a different type of forward. One who’s a little more mobile, a little faster. Edin is a fantastic player, but with different physical and technical attributes to the ones Guardiola wants.”He is banging the table now, swept away with the force of his own sentiment. Italy’s biggest clubs first came calling for him in the summer of 2016, yet he turned them down then because he could not stand to walk away from Sassuolo in a year when he had just led them to their first-ever Europa League qualification.Di Francesco believes in seeing a project through to its conclusion. For Roma, he hopes, a first Champions League semi-final in 34 years is just the beginning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/467ed2042c397dff1e280e29dd092fcee5ccf85b/90_194_3414_2049/master/3414.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fb9d897efa73f95eaecd93fb0697ae1","title":"arsenal v west ham premier league live","story":"Alexandre Lacazette scored twice, while Nacho Monreal and Aaron Ramsey netted one each in what turned into a simple winThat’s all folks.Well done to Jacob for manning the blog for the game. Will the rest of Wenger’s reign be so positive? We will find out on Thursday.On the upside for West Ham, Stoke were held at home by Burnley, so will struggle to stay up now. Paul Doyle was at the Bet365.Moyes thought his team were good for a point until Rice ducked under Ramsey’s cross.Asked whether 4-1 was a fair result, Moyes said: “The last 10 minutes it might have been but before then we were good for a point.“The young should have headed it away, why he ducked I have no idea. “We’re distraught for the team, as I thought the team effort was incredible.“I am more disappointed in the last five minutes but maybe I had too many attacking players on.”Our man Daniel Daniel Taylor was at the Emirates. Read his report: Wenger has spoken to a slightly less croaky Shreeves.“I think we are at the moment top of the home league. We constructed patiently our win in the first half, it was tough to find space.“From the second half onwards we looked like we could score as we found more space.“At 1-1 you could see we were wobbling or not and the second goal killed them.”Regarding the Elneny injury, Wenger said: “It doesn’t look good on his ankle.”The Frenchman was also pretty diplomatic on his future and whether he jumped before he was pushed. “Look, I have nothing to add. I think it was in my statement what I wanted to say. Apart from that, I have nothing to say.”Lacazette showed that he can be clinical in front of goal, once again. His efforts will be a great boon for the Frenchman and anyone who arrives to manage him in the summer, knowing how much attacking prowess Arsenal have to offer.Poor Joe Hart. He made two absolutely stunning saves but his game will not be remembered for conceding late goals and Ramsey’s cross into the net. I would argue that was the fault of Declan Rice - no goalkeeper is expecting their defender to duck out of a header on the edge of the six-yard box. It was a very strange decision from the young centre-back, one he will not make again.Henry doing some more criticism of the Arsenal defence, pointing out no one bothered to see where Arnautovic was in the box. It was pretty poor from the back four. Maybe that will change next season...Aaron Ramsey has spoken to a very croaky Geoff Shreeves on the win.“We took a bit of time to get going it was very hot out there, but I don’t want to make excuses.”On Wenger’s imminent departure: “Obviously, it’s really tough to take. He’s believed in us, backed us and given us all these opportunities. I owe him a lot and he deserves everything he gets.“We’re not thinking about who’s coming in next and it’s all about doing it for him and hopefully we can end up with a cup.”A final one for the list...Well...it was all quite easy in the end for Arsenal. Aubameyang make a very positive after coming on. Would have been a touch underwhelming if Wenger began his long good with a defeat. They were helped by the second goal coming from a Rice mistake but Arsenal were on top at that stage.That’s all from me. Will Unwin will take you through the post-match reaction.It’s Arsene Wenger’s day! And nobody can really have any complaints about that. Unless you’re David Moyes. 90 min+2: Lacazette, on a hat-trick, almost dribbles through. Instead he lays it back to Xhaka, who sidefoots a decent chance over. West Ham have badly run out of steam. They are six points above the bottom three with four matches left and aren’t quite safe yet.90 min: There will be four added minutes. “There’s only one Arsene Wenger!” the Arsenal fans chant.Ramsey dribbles into the area from the left, beating Zabaleta with ease, and cuts it back to Lacazette. He eludes one challenge before slamming a low shot past Hart. Arsenal have turned on the style!87 min: Arnautovic is booked for barging Aubameyang over.Arsenal are enjoying themselves now. Welbeck plays a one-two with Xhaka and finds Aubameyang. He moves it on to Lacazette, whose shot from the right zips off Cresswell and flies past the unfortunate Hart.84 min: That defending was so bad it’s enough to make you think Rice was paying tribute to latter-day Wengerball.This is a farce. Arsenal counter down the right, Aubameyang tearing down the right. His cross is headed away by Rice, but Ramsey picks the ball up on the left. He curls a cross into the six-yard box and this time Rice decides to duck under it and leave the ball to Hart. One problem: Hart isn’t telepathic and he was unable to stop the cross from drifting into the far corner! Oh dear. A total breakdown in communication, Rice showing his inexperience, and Arsenal have the lead again!80 min: There’s more mayhem in the West Ham area, Hart unable to gather a loose ball, Ogbonna unable to hack clear, but Ramsey and Lacazette can’t bundle the ball in. West Ham survive.79 min: Arsenal are enjoying a lot of possession at the moment. West Ham can’t get out. A clearance falls to Welbeck. He curls one towards the far corner from the left, but Hart flies to his left to brilliantly push it away! That looked a certain goal! What a goalkeeper!78 min: The crowd’s a bit quiet. You can hear the shouts of encouragement from the West Ham bench. “Get out him to, Cheikh ... Get it out, Arthur ... Bring me, Marouane Fellaini.”76 min: The camera lingers on Andy Carroll, allowing us to gaze at the Geordie hunk for a while.74 min: Mustafi goes through the back of Hernandez. He’s booked. He isn’t very good, is he?73 min: Koscielny attacks Xhaka’s corner, but Hart gathers the loose ball.72 min: Xhaka lines one up from 25 yards, steps round Noble and forces Hart to tip his low effort wide of the left post. Excellent save. 71 min: The West Ham fans are singing about Carlton Cole, as you do.68 min: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will be on soon. You have to wonder if Wenger ever wanted him. 65 min: Ashley Barnes has made it Stoke 1-1 Burnley.Masuaku surges down the left and crosses towards Arnautovic. Ospina comes flying out to punch away, but West Ham keep pressing. Kouyate sees a shot blocked. The ball eventually comes to Lanzini, who manages to poke it to Arnautovic, free on the left. He takes a touch and then he rams a brilliant low shot past Ospina, the power too much for the Arsenal goalkeeper to handle! Oh Arsenal.63 min: Zabaleta’s chipped cross forces Koscielny to glance away from Arnautovic. The ball comes to Masuaku, who wins a corner on the left. Lanzini’s corner is headed away but West Ham keep pressing, a spell of head tennis ending with Arnautovic volleying over.62 min: Maitland-Niles is booked for a late tackle on Noble.61 min: A free-kick to West Ham on the right. Lanzini whips it in and almost combines with another substitute, only for Hernandez to head over. That was a good chance for a player of Hernandez’s finishing ability and he knows it.60 min: Manuel Lanzi replaces the ineffective Edimilson Fernandes and Javier Hernandez replaces the disappointing Joao Mario.58 min: West Ham are about to introduce Manuel Lanzini and Javier Hernandez.57 min: Iwobi pops up on the right and cuts the ball back to Ramsey, who sweeps a shot wide. Meanwhile a replay of Monreal’s goal shows that the dozy Masuaku was standing on the post and simply stepped aside, leaving it to Hart, who was furious. Absurd defending. He could have cleared it.55 min: Arsenal are rampant now. West Ham are all over the place. They’ve not recovered from going behind. Lacazette gets a shot away from inside the area, but it’s blocked. Then Ogbonna heads a dangerous cross behind for a corner.53 min: Arsenal fancy this now - which is nice of them - and Iwobi drives into the area from the right, only to ruin a promising run with a poor cross.A corner to Arsenal on the left. Xhaka sends it towards the penalty spot and the unmarked Monreal arrives to volley the ball low to Hart’s right! Wenger in!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5367cb32a628ee6aa2de1fccb62bc7763cf66fd9/201_48_2458_1475/master/2458.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbb14f830e3af890e30056f0e4c19818","title":"chelsea v southampton fa cup semi final live","story":"An extraordinary slalom from Olivier Giroud and a header from the substitute Alvaro Morata put Chelsea into another FA Cup finalDominic Fifield’s match report has landed, so I shall leave you with that. Thanks for your company today, bye!Antonio Conte speaks! “To reach two FA Cup finals in a row is not easy. I’m pleased for our fans, who deserve this win the most. Now it’s important to try to finish the league season as strongly as possible and then to think about the final.”The general conclusion is that Mr Laws is not a football man, and that’s why Southampton’s goal was disallowed.Re: the disallowed goal, Graham Poll says that goalkeepers are protected by the laws if their feet are off the ground in the six-yard box. In essence, you can’t touch them. Olivier Giroud on his slalom solo goal “My second passion is actually skiing! I just tried to dribble a little bit and I had a bit of luck, but that’s what I wanted to do. I’m very pleased for the team as we’ve done a great job. Wembley is like my garden and I love to play here.”Eden Hazard speaks! “We fully deserved to win. I thought we played a very good game, especially second half, and created a lot of chances. At half-time the manager just told us to keep the ball and to play our game. We scored beautiful goals, especially Olivier. Now we go to the final.” There’s a lot of talk about Southampton’s goal that never was, with Austin penalised for a foul on Caballero when the score was 1-0. Graham Poll on BT Sport thought it was a clear foul in accordance with the laws of the game. But what do the laws know?In other news, you will not believe the score at the Etihad.Peep peep! Chelsea are through to yet another FA Cup final on 19 May, where they will meet Jose Mourinho and Manchester United. That’ll have a dignified build up. They were the better team at Wembley, with Eden Hazard at his mesmeric best, but Southampton also had chances in a very entertaining second half. Olivier Giroud scored an extraordinary solo goal 28 seconds after half-time, with the substitute Alvaro Morata sealing it late on.Do stay with us for some post-match reaction.90+1 min There will be five minutes of added sweat and toil.89 min This is over. Southampton know it. Chelsea know it. Even educated fleas know it.87 min The tireless Austin swings a snapshot over the bar.86 min McCarthy makes an excellent save from Morata, who could have had a hat-trick in the six minutes he’s been on the field.84 min It’s all happening! Austin hits the post at one end, and then Morata’s shot is cleared off the line by Hoedt! 83 min So much for striker stereotypes: Giroud scored a Morata goal and Morata has now scored a Giroud goal.Chelsea will play Manchester United in the FA Cup final. The substitute Morata makes an instant impact, heading into the net from Azpilicueta’s cross. They have been such a deadly combination this season.80 min A loose ball breaks to Auston just inside the area, but his volley is too close to Caballero. Chelsea make their last change, with Alvaro Morata replacing the goalscorer Olivier Romarioud.79 min “I like Giroud, but I’ve never quite been able to figure him out,” says Matt Dony. “He’s always been very willing to go for the spectacular, but it often goes awry. When it comes off, though, he can look magnificent. Is he a fantastic player, who sadly doesn’t consistently hit the heights? Or does he just attempt enough ‘Wow’ moments that some are bound to work out, law of averages and all that. He definitely does rock the classic film-star good looks, though.”78 min Another Southampton change: Manolo Gabbiadini replaces Bednarek. Southampton are going for it.77 min More great play from Hazard, who makes space on the right before driving a low cross into the area. Cedric’s attempted clearance hits Yoshida and loops just over the bar.75 min Graham Poll, on BT Sport, says it was a clear foul by Austin on Caballero. So there you go.74 min McCarthy leaps to make a cracking save from Hazard’s fierce rising shot. I can’t keep up with this.73 min Caballero almost drops the ball into his own net, though a foul had been given against Austin so it wouldn’t have counted. I’m not sure it was a foul - and it might have been over the line as well. Oh VAR where art thou?72 min How did Caballero save that?! Redmond belted a low right-footed shot from 25 yards that seemed to have squirmed under the keeper, but it ended up going for a corner. I have no idea what happened there. It was like an optical illusion.71 min Hazard does a Rabona cross. Yoshida heads it away.70 min This is Southampton’s best spell of the match. It might just be that necessity is the mother of invention or it might be that Tadic is on the pitch.68 min Southampton appeal for handball and a penalty when Austin’s flashing header hits Giroud. All they get is a corner. It did hit Giroud’s arm, which was away from his body, and I’m surprised VAR wasn’t used there. The case for Giroud is that he was only a couple of yards away from Austin, but his arm was in an unnatural position and it was worth another look.66 min Tadic plays a good pass out to Bertrand, who gets to the byline but overhits his cross. That was a better move from Southampton.65 min Hoedt is booked for a lunge at Hazard.64 min Chelsea make a change to beef up their midfield. A disappointed Willian is replaced by Bakayoko, and walks straight down the tunnel in a huff.63 min Southampton make a double change: Dusan Tadic and Nathan Redmond replace Shane Long and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg.62 min Long goes over in the box after a slight shove from Cahill. I don’t think it was a penalty but it was a bit risky from Cahill.59 min Giroud looks okay to continue, and has a chance to play Willian through on goal. His pass is blocked.58 min That goal from Giroud is so good. I’ve never seen a goal quite like it, though there was a touch of Romario in the way he sat everyone down.57 min Romeu, already booked, crunches Giroud, who goes down in a lot of pain. It was a fair tackle but he caught Giroud’s ankle in his follow through. Giroud is really struggling.55 min Lemina is booked for a foul on - you got it, stud - Hazard. 54 min Long misses a great chance to equalise! Austin’s lovely dummy allowed him to run through on goal, but his touch around Caballero was comically heavy and went straight out for a goalkick.50 min Romeu is booked for a foul on Hazard.48 min Southampton appeal for a penalty when Long goes down after a good tackle from Fabregas. No need for VAR. Chelsea break superbly and Hazard whips a lovely curling shot just wide of the far post.It was a fantastic goal. Giroud was found in the area by Hazard and showed brilliant skill to slalom through as defenders slid all around him. He just walked past the lot of them, and the keeper McCarthy, before poking the ball into the net as he fell over. By that stage an army of Southampton defenders were also on the floor, stripped or their dignity and their clean sheet. “It’s like the Grand National,” says Glenn Hoddle on BT Sport, who calls the goal “a chicane”. That was a ridiculous demonstration of skill and composure in a space the size of a phonebox. Honestly, that was the best goal Romario never scored.Giroud scores after 28 seconds of the second half! 46 min “Daft team that Hughes put out,” says Steve Hoare. “Relies too much on the wing backs for creation. We have JWP, Davis, Boufal, Redmond, Tadic... surely one of them has to play?”I suppose he is trying to stay in the game for as long as possible and let human nature take over in the final quarter. But I would have at least one of them in the team. There’s so much talent in that squad I can’t believe they are going down.46 min Peep peep. Chelsea begin the second half.Half-time chit-chat “It doesn’t seem that VAR so far is being used for outrageously blatantly bad decisions there doesn’t seem to be the concept or equivalent of the ‘Umpire’s Call’ in cricket,” says Adam Roberts. “The ‘wobbly line’ offside decision (Mata’s goal) is particularly good example. Even after several viewings, ‘experts’ still disagreed. A perfect time for an umpire’s call ruling.”It’s almost like it hasn’t been thought through properly. The commentator Arlo White suggested thickening the offside line to create that element of ‘umpire’s call’. I like that idea.Chelsea have been much the better team, without creating many clear chances. See you in 10 minutes for the second half of this football festival.44 min The match is sleepwalking towards half-time. It’s been a half to remember, but only if you are into mental self-harm.43 min “I almost miss the violent stylings of West Brom’s Hegazi amid all ths dazzling Chelsea running about with the ball stuff,” says Ian Copestake. “His delivery of a punch so weak that it could have been passed off as a sign of affection shows how out of touch the modern footballer has become from the days of hard Ron ‘hard’ Harris, etc.”41 min Yoshida is booked for a foul on Giroud.39 min A chance for Giroud. He made a complete mess of an attempted flying volley from Fabregas’s cross, but the ball bounced straight up in the air and he was able to launch into another acrobatic volley. This time he connected well and it flew just wide.38 min With the square root of bugger all happening on the pitch, this is probably an opportune time to remind you that, if necessary, the match will go to extra-time and penalties.34 min Southampton have the look of a team who are waiting to be put out of their misery. They need to change something because this system isn’t working. I’d be tempted to get Tadic on at half-time.33 min Willian’s corner from the left is flicked on at the near post by Azpilicueta and flashes right across the face of goal.32 min “Teams’ substitutes’ benches seem to have taken on the look of a dock in a court, filled with those suspected of various misdemeanours and publicly awaiting their fate,” says Ian Copestake. “I’d be unsurprised if Jimmy McNulty was seen hovering in the background of the Chelsea bench.”The Wire is a bit of an old reference point, grandad. I’ve moved on to Homicide: Life on the Street."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/240cb3717bc07e65355ed94d845a47ebfb249b44/0_323_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bf1bd8c58f318deaff4d827312c3f22","title":"manchester city v swansea premier league live","story":"48 min: De Bruyne dribbles inside and sees his shot blocked.

She talks to  Sophie Heawood about falling in love, one-night stands and going nuts on stageWhen I meet Amy Schumer, she has been married for exactly one month and is working on a joke about her husband’s penis. Something along the lines of, my husband is uncircumcised – for now. She had jotted it down on the Notes app on her iPhone, where she keeps a lot of ideas, but it duplicated the note five times “so now it looks like I really have plans to mutilate him,” she says.She then admits that she actually first used that line about another man she used to date, “but you have to update it so it’s about the person you’re with now. And really, my husband is good, he can keep everything he has. At this point in my life, I’m cool with foreskin or not – God bless everyone and their penii,” she says, breezily, as if she might have exhausted herself by creating a persona who is supposed to care so much.Amy Schumer is a conundrum. A native New Yorker, she made her incredibly successful name doing stand-up comedy about raw, rude sex and all of its discontents, about dating and dirtiness and blacking out drunk and doing the walk of shame home. Her TV sketch show, Inside Amy Schumer, ran for four series on Comedy Central and often mercilessly skewered the gender hypocrisy of what our culture allows men and women to do, in particular the beauty myths that silently surround women, in sketches such as “Girl You Don’t Need Makeup” and “Her Last Fuckable Day”.At the Glamour awards in London in 2015, after various female celebrities had tottered up to the stage to receive awards in heels they could barely walk in and dresses they could barely breathe in, Schumer strode on. “I’m probably 160lb right now,” she said, looking out over the audience with disdain, “and I can catch a dick whenever I want. That’s the truth.” I was there she changed the mood of the room from faux modesty to explosive, spluttering laughter, and all the disdained women ran up to her afterwards, desperate to be her friend. It felt like a tipping point in that industry famous women have been letting their guard down ever since.Yet a couple of months later, her debut movie Trainwreck came out, which she wrote and starred in. It began promisingly and originally, but ended with her character giving up her competitive career and literally becoming a cheerleader – an actual cheerleader – for her clever, high-achieving man. The next year Schumer published her autobiography, The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo, in which, alongside stories of a childhood going from riches to rags on Long Island with her dad’s dodgy business skills and then illness, and both her parents’ philandering, she wrote that, actually, she had only ever had a one-night stand once, and it was lovely and respectful, thank you very much.Now she has made I Feel Pretty, a film about a woman who gets a bash on the head and wrongly believes herself to have become as beautiful as a supermodel, and so creates a whole new life for her sexy self. The film asks if beauty is a state of mind – while also involving Schumeresque motifs such as a vaginal injury on an exercise bike.Meanwhile, Schumer has surprised the gossip papers by suddenly getting married, to a chef called Chris Fischer, in a lacy white wedding dress on a clifftop in Malibu. For celebrities, this is as traditional as your father walking you down the aisle in your village church. Coverage of the wedding made it all sound rather giddy and impulsive, but when I ask her about it, she is anything but.“I feel exactly the same as before I was married – but I’m psyched. I love him,” she says, her face deadly serious, like she’s been through a thing or two in this life. “Like, I’m fucking – it feels like having a partner. It feels like not being alone.” We are sitting in a rather fancy hotel suite overlooking Central Park, where Schumer is promoting her new movie. Her bodyguard is in the next room, along with two assistants who have taken Schumer’s tiny black poodle Tatiana, who was barking too much for the interview. “He’s 38, I’m 36, so, you know, we are not completing each other. We already are who we are and just want to support and encourage each other. And so I’m psyched that I don’t have to be zipping up my knee boots, leaving someone’s apartment at 3am. I’m done.” She says this wasn’t like other relationships, “where you’re like, come on, pleeease meet my parents. I can’t believe I dealt with any of that bullshit before! This was like, oh my God I fucking love this person, and I admire him, and we’re a team and he was ready.”I ask her if it is hard, having created such a bold sexual persona, ever to find the space to feel shy, but she looks baffled by that question and says that she isn’t ever shy. In fact, she looks baffled by quite a few of my questions: interviews are clearly not her favourite thing. I want to discuss her work being about the concept of fuckability, but she says that that’s not accurate, and turns her nose up a bit.She says this film is about her character Renee simply wanting to be seen, and though there’s a boyfriend angle, “I don’t think of this movie as a love story. It’s about her and her friends.” She says the dressing-up is for other women, because she has learned, with age, that we don’t really dress for men. “In my experience, men are not that psyched and the guys that I’m attracted to aren’t the guys who are like, ‘Oh, is that the new Givenchy line?’ I think, her thing is about confidence and about feeling attractive.”Well, yes and no. I mean if it’s all about women, then her character entering a bikini competition and shaking her stuff all over the stage in a e bar full of men does seem an interesting move. Yet the thing about the bikini scene is – it becomes lovely. You start watching it behind your hands, cringing – and by the end you’re charmed by the sight of someone just thoroughly, unabashedly enjoying herself.Schumer is glad I liked that scene, and says she fought for it. She was supposed to just stand there, “but I said no, I’m going to go nuts on stage, I’m going to dump water on myself, do the whole thing. And I seriously fought everybody and I’m so glad I did.” She also has a sex scene, and fought to be allowed to reveal more flesh but still have the film rated 13. “I think we should see more, you know, and I’m not letting them retouch any of me in the movie.”There is an idiosyncratic, pioneering power to Schumer’s comedy work that I keep looking for in her films. They veer towards slapstick whereas her solo material has brains and guts. I do not make myself popular by suggesting this, and Schumer bristles when I ask what sort of movies she would make if there was no financial compulsion for feelgood endings.“You know, I said no to a movie where I would have made five times this amount of money,” she says. Really? Someone else’s project? “Mmm,” she replies, mysteriously. “For me, it’s not so much about the money. Like, I wouldn’t want to spend three years of my life working on The Revenant. I filmed a drama two years ago and it was a bummer. I don’t want to show people what I can do – I just want to do stuff that will make people feel better.”Hot women, once the butt of her jokes, now get cast in her films. I Feel Pretty co-stars Emily Ratajkowski, who rose to fame dancing topless in the Blurred Lines music video, and also features a cameo from Naomi Campbell. “I did a lot of press yesterday sitting next to Emily and I think that probably would have been kind of hard for me 10 years ago,” she admits. They were wearing similar clothes, “and I would have made a joke about it before – but now it’s just – I just feel like that’s over. I kind of feel done with the self-ranking thing.”She says this comes from growing up and realising that she feels most beautiful when she’s away with her girls, or on a night out where she’s just “so happy, so comfortable, you know who you are. And then it’s like, well, why can’t we just feel like that all the time?” One of those girls is her best buddy Jennifer Lawrence. “I texted her yesterday and I was like, ‘I did an interview today and I told them you were really hideous up close.’ And she wrote, ‘Actual LOL’, and then she added in parenthesis ‘(Because I’m so pretty, you know?)’ And I was like, ‘Exactly.’” I ask about their shared sense of humour. “Well, Jen’s quick. She picks up on things that I just mutter to make myself laugh. I’ll just say something under my breath, and she’ll be like, ‘I heard that.’”Speaking of comic actors, Michelle Williams is an absolute revelation in I Feel Pretty. It’s perhaps the biggest shock of the film. “Me too,” says Schumer. “I didn’t know she was really funny. Like she’s really funny. Why didn’t we know? It’s because they always put her in some awful thing where she’s got to be on the floor, crying.”As for the #MeToo movement, Schumer wholly supports it but isn’t jumping up and down whooping about it “because, while it’s exciting, it’s also really triggering and upsetting. It makes everybody feel super vulnerable. But to think that this generation is going to say, ‘This isn’t acceptable,’ and not just bury the things that our mothers buried – that feels really good. It feels like, across the board, we’re getting closer to equality. Which is – it’s such a gut-wrenching thing to even have to say that.”She must have seen a few of her own male colleagues in comedy go down. “Right, there are people you love that can have really shitty behaviour that needs to be called out. And then there are so many men who are just scared, they’re just waiting for the phone to ring, they’re waiting to open their computer and see their faces and it’s a frightening time for them. But then we’re going, ‘We’ve been frightened our whole lives.’”As for the future, Schumer continues to campaign for gun control, aided by her distant cousin the US senator Chuck Schumer, and to call out certain other senators and their links to the NRA. It’s a subject even closer to her heart after two young women were shot in an American cinema while watching her movie Trainwreck. The day we meet, schoolkids are pouring out of their classrooms across the USA to demonstrate, “and I think once I start looking at that news footage I’ll just be crying all day,” she says. We discuss the Florida survivors, such as Emma Gonzalez. “These kids are really making an impact and I feel more hopeful right now than I thought possible,” she says. “This has been more movement than I thought that I would see in my lifetime. I think what they’re just realising is that the adults are not actually in control.”It’s also time for a change in Schumer’s own life. I ask about a typical day for her and she says that for the past 10 years, from the moment she woke up till she went to sleep, “I was driven and working and writing. Doing stand-up, you know, promoting something or filming something. I would say that, for 15 years, I was getting up at seven, going boxing, showering, going to the writer’s room all day, and having an interview during lunch. Afterward, maybe getting some sort of acupuncture before going and doing stand-up, and then having, like, 90 minutes when I could write when I got home. You know? That’s been it. I’ve been hustling for so long, I want to take care of myself now. I got really sick and it just made me realise I wasn’t invincible. I need to slow down.”One last thing though – can we just clear up the one-night-stand thing? Do you really mean you only had sex within relationships? “No! See to me, a one-night stand is where you meet someone that same day, you have sex with them, and then you never see them again. Sleeping with a friend or having sex with someone you know just once, no, I don’t consider that a one-night stand. I should make an addendum to that book. Something else I realised: I wrote that I don’t like watercress in the book. But I meant water chestnuts. So I need to publish two corrections, I guess.”I Feel Pretty is in cinemas in the UK and Ireland on 4 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1609fdbaa24c27e170a6ce4a832e583c2e7cc51/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c8c9feb141b85bc1db8cfdb91eac762","title":"20 best vegan wines supermarkets online","story":"With more choices available in supermarkets and online than ever before, the Observer’s wine writer selects the pick of the bunchIn one sense, defining a vegan or vegetarian wine is easy. They’re wines made without the use of, respectively, animal or meat products. But herbivores and carnivores alike may not have considered the possibility of animal products appearing in a drink that is, after all, supposed to be fermented grapes. What the hell is a non-vegan or non-vegetarian wine, you might reasonably ask.The explanation is simple, if, for vegans and vegetarians, not especially reassuring. Most wine producers use animal-derived products to act as a filter for organic particles that may be detrimental to its flavour, texture, colour or appearance. It may be boiled fish bladders (isinglass) or animal parts (gelatin) it could be blood or bone marrow, egg whites (albumen), milk protein (casein), fish oil or shellfish fibres.All are longstanding traditions and, looked at in one way, remarkable testaments to human ingenuity ( who first came up with the idea of using bone marrow to clean wine?). But that’s hardly a comfort if your conversion to veganism has been scuppered by an unwitting sip of blood-fined malbec.Things are getting better for vegan and vegetarian wine-drinkers, however. More winemakers are choosing to use mineral and plant-based fining agents, from bentonite clay and silica gel to plant casein.Importers and supermarkets have also got better at sourcing, labelling and marketing vegan and vegetarian wines. Marks \u0026amp Spencer leads the way in this respect, with 384 vegan-friendly bottles the Co-op, long a pioneer of transparency in wine ingredients, now has 77. So it’s now possible to find these wines everywhere, making my selection of the following 20 vegan bottles much easier than it would have been even two years ago.Toro Loco Organic Red Utiel-Requena, Spain 2015 (£4.99, Aldi)Although it would be a mistake to equate vegan or vegetarian with organic when it comes to wine, Aldi’s bargain tinto from near Valencia satisfies both demands with a bold-berry character, and an easy, smoked paprika-partnering succulence.Saint-Auriol Corbières France 2016 (£6.99, Waitrose)For rich, multi-layered bean and root vegetable stews with plenty of herbs this is an excellent value red blend from the wilds of the Languedoc in southern France, dark and spicy but supple with liquorice and rosemary and red and black berries.Zalze Shiraz Grenache Viognier Western Cape, South Africa 2016 (£7.49, The Co-op)From one of South Africa’s most consistent producers a typically robust but fragrant red Rhône-alike with just a hint of smoke to help smooth down such vegan or vegetarian barbecue favourites as halloumi cheese, aubergine or portobello mushrooms.Morrisons Fleurie Beaujolais, France 2016 (£8.25, Morrisons)The name, Fleurie, of this Beaujolais district or cru suggests something prettily floral, and that’s certainly part of the attraction here, along with the regional speciality of sappy, crunchy fresh cherry-berry fruit and thirst-quenching freshness.Plessis-Duval Saumur-Champigny France 2015 (£10, Marks \u0026amp Spencer)High-quality Loire reds made from cabernet franc are one of the highlights of spring-into-summer-drinking, and this is very nicely done, bringing the red berry fruit, appetisingly grippy tannins and racy mineral refreshment in briskly satisfying style.Coffele Valpolicella Italy 2016 (£10.50, thewinesociety.com)The much-abused north-eastern Italian red wine style is here presented as the wonderfully pure, fluent, light and graceful cherry-fruited delight it always should be, its bright acidity a natural partner for any tomato-based dish, from pasta to ratatouille.Pure South Pinot Noir Tasmania, Australia 2016 (£15, Marks \u0026amp Spencer)Green and pleasant Tasmania has become one of Australia’s best places for pinot noir, and this is a wonderfully silky fruit-driven style, all plump fresh strawberry with just a touch of the grape’s trademark forest-floor great alone or with beetroot dishes.The Hedonist Shiraz McLaren Vale, Australia 2016 (£14.49, Waitrose)Walter Clappis is a believer in organic and biodynamic farming and this wine, while having all of the gutsy ripe dark fruit you’d want from Aussie shiraz, has a distinctive, moreish glossiness and savoury depths that are great with mushroom.Principe Corsini Le Corti Chianti Classico 2014 (from £18.50, bottleapostle.com tannico.co.uk thewinetwit.com)While proudly touting this superb chianti’s vegan credentials, the producer’s website suggests only meat-based matches. But with its streak of floral-herbal-inflected cherry fruit and gentle tannins it’s a natural match for vegetable stews and pasta sauces.Tesco Finest Côtes de Gascogne France 2016 (£6.50, Tesco)A long-term favourite in Tesco’s range, made by the impeccable Gascon co-operative Plaimont, this is a brilliantly versatile, tangy dry white with grapefruit, gooseberry and the freshest acidity for crunchy green salads and stir-fries.Co-op Irresistible Leyda Valley Sauvignon Blanc 2017 (£7.49, The Co-op)Another consistent own-label dry white performer that I was delighted to discover is vegan, this is classic modern Chilean sauvignon, elderflower and peapod infused with invigorating citrus zip and nip in fruit grown in the cooling breezes of the Pacific Ocean.Granite Earth Swartland, South Africa 2017 (£8.50, Morrisons)The rich white blend, often based on chenin blanc, is a modern South African classic style, with this stunner from the granite soils of the Swartland region offering exotic stone fruit richness to complement mildly spiced Vietnamese-inspired salads.Thymiopoulos Atma White Malagousia and Xinomavro Náousa, Greece 2017 (£8.50, thewinesociety.com)Apostolos Thymiopoulos, one of the stars of modern Greece, has fashioned a delightful summer white from the exotically fleshy malagousia and the white juice (but not skins) of red grape xinomavro: blossom and tropical fruit salad in a juicy but fresh style for veggie Greek meze.Kumeu River Village Pinot Gris Auckland, New Zealand 2016 (£11.50, tanners-wines.co.uk)The Brajkovich family is one of the founders of modern New Zealand wine, and they continue to impress with, in this case, an opulent Alsace-inspired pinot gris that mixes roses, baking spice and ripe quince with a spicy stir-fry-happy oiliness of texture.Meinklang Grüner Veltliner Burgenland, Austria 2016 (£11.75, vintageroots.co.uk)Austrian white grape variety grüner veltliner has some distinctive savoury flavours (leafy herb, celery salt, white pepper) that pair well with fresh vegetable dishes. This biodynamic example adds lush-but-crisp green apple and pear to the delicious mix.Quinta de Soalheiro Allo Minho, Portugal 2016 (£15.50, oddbins.com)In the far north of Portugal, Soalheiro has earned its high reputation as one of the best producers of peachy alvarinho (aka albariño). Here they combine it with the laurel-scented loureiro for an impeccable, racy, mineral light-but-flavour packed vegan delight.Graham Beck Brut Rosé South Africa NV (from £12.99, majestic.co.uk)An excellent match for mild chilli or gingery spicing in vegan and vegetarian stif-fries and salads thanks to its creamy mousse and barely perceptible dose of sugar, this rosé fizz from Cape master Graham Beck is all fresh red berries with savoury notes.Tesco Finest English Sparkling Brut Kent, England NV (£17.50, Tesco)Coming in at the cheaper end of the English sparkling spectrum, this classy Kentish blend of the classic chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier triumvirate is made by the justly well-regarded Hush Heath estate in a graceful, crisp, incisive style.Sainsbury’s Blanc de Noirs Brut Champagne, France NV (£18, Sainsbury’s)A white blend of Champagne’s two red grapes (pinot meunier and pinot noir), this is always one of the best supermarket sparklers around, with flavours of raspberry, redcurrant and digestive biscuit in its deep, creamy but elegantly racy palate.Bodegas Hidalgo La Gitana Manzanilla, Jerez, Spain NV (£8, 50cl, Sainsbury’s £10.99, 75cl Waitrose)If the switch from meat and dairy has left you with a craving for umami that can only be partly sated by mushrooms, soy and nutritional yeast, dry sherry is here to help, this breezy light classic from Sanlúcar offering salted-nut savouriness and a whiff of the sea."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8b8b92c3613ff26be9a3632c56125c436e3cbbb/0_28_3777_2267/master/3777.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=296be0ff084ac3072a84ca7623374c7a","title":"everything you need to know about recovering from a marathon","story":"Your race is done, the medal is won. But what next? How do you recover properly after running 26.2 miles? Here’s the lowdown on compression gear, ice baths, sleep and when to get back into trainingCongratulations! You are a marathoner. For months, you’ve focused on that one goal – had nightmares about it, over-analysed every niggle and spent sleepless nights fretting about what shoes to wear. Well, now you’ve gone and done it. The box is ticked, the medal is hanging around your neck. So, what now?The chances are that having pored over every minute decision that went into running the race, you’ve given absolutely no thought to how to recover from it: you certainly won’t be alone. But if you want to recover in good speed, and get back out there – either to train for another marathon or just stop feeling like a bus hit you – then you should. Treat the recovery the same way as you did the training – as an integral part of the marathon process, and you’ll soon be back and raring to go. Get back too soon and push too early, and you risk injury.The second you cross that line, your legs will go from running to “utterly incapable of movement”. But don’t stop. The best thing you can do is just keep moving – it doesn’t matter how slowly. Get into clean, dry clothes and comfy shoes: I’ll be staggering around slowly in Oofos slides, others swear by cheap flip-flops. Whatever you find comfortable. If you are a fan of compression gear, now is also the time to get into that (a challenge in itself, when it comes to climbing into those tights ... ). While the jury is out on the benefits of actually running in compression gear, it can definitely help aid recovery. Go for proper, quality compression like those from CEP. It’s one area where cheap options can be a false economy. If you have any very specific sore spots, noticeable immediately, you can try a topical product like a ‘freezing’ spray. Chris Roberts, a rehabilitation therapist, explains: “Cryotherapy products such as Biofreeze are topical analgesics, which work through a ‘counter-irritant’ mechanism. This creates a sensation that overrides pain signals to the brain. This process is known as ‘gate control theory’, where nerve impulses from one stimulus block the nerves containing pain signals to the brain. But it is important to remember that cryotherapy only provides temporary pain relief and is not a long-term solution if injury does occur.”A note on painkillers: please, please, think twice. NSAIDs – such as ibuprofen or aspirin – are a lot stronger than many people realise. No one wants to be in pain, but you also don’t want to mask injury and risk making it worse. Nor do you want to do damage to a body that’s just gone through quite an ordeal. NSAIDS can cause harm to your kidneys, which are already working overtime, given you are undoubtedly mildly dehydrated, at best, and increase your blood pressure to risky levels, as well as putting you at greater risk for hyponatremia. You can research, endlessly, the latest research into the right balance of protein vs carbs and the crucial post-race recovery window in which to eat them. And in an ideal world, you’ll have that three-parts carbsone-part protein snack waiting for you. However ... I’ve run 10 marathons and I know full well that sometimes you can’t even look at food after the race. You’ve just run 26.2 miles and your stomach is queasy, full of gels and in rebellion. Don’t worry, just try and eat whatever you can cope with, whether that’s an ice cream, a bag of crisps, a banana or a protein bar. Have a proper good meal later: heaven knows you’ve earned it. Or celebrate the next day when you feel up to it. Do, however, make sure you rehydrate – take the water you’ll be offered at the finish and keep sipping away for the rest of the day.Back in the comfort of your home or hotel room, it’s time to soak those aching limbs. So what’s better, hot or cold? “The research is ever changing in this area,” says Neil Smith, a physiotherapist at Pure Sports Medicine. “But I would say that ice baths are likely to be better for recovery than a hot bath. It may not be the first thing you want to inflict on yourself after 26.2 gruelling miles – but it does have some positive effects – including reducing Doms (delayed onset muscle soreness). However, if you really feel like a dip in a hot bath the evening of the marathon then no one is going to stop you!” Also note that you do not need access to a fancy cryogenic chamber: “How cold it should be is definitely a personal choice – but something in the region of 15C would work” says Smith. “Some athletes like to go as low as 8C – and that is still achievable with cold water and plenty of bags of ice.”However, Smith and his colleague Lisa Posnett are sceptical that Epsom salts, which are often recommended as a post-marathon remedy, make any difference. “Epsom salt is a common name for magnesium sulphate,” they say. “Despite it being used for decades, there is actually little evidence out there to support its use and muscle soreness alleviation. The idea behind it is it helps reduce magnesium deficiency. However, if it seems to work for you – even if it just provides a placebo effect – then go for it!”Many races will offer you a quick post-race massage. That can definitely help, but can also involve standing around in a queue, which itself can be a form of post-race torture. But if you can afford it, a proper sports massage is a really good idea. As Ellen Cook, sports massage therapist at Ten Health and Fitness says: “The sooner you can do this, the better, as it will flush out any lactic acid that has built up during the race and in turn reduce the build-up of muscle tension. Pushing ourselves that far can cause damage to the muscles. Sports massages help by warming up the muscle fibres through friction and improves blood flow and circulation. Once the muscles are warm they become more malleable, making it easier to release tension, re-align them and ultimately speeding up the healing process.”And if you’ve had a Torquemada-like experience, then don’t be put off. “There are many myths out there regarding sports massage,” says Cook. “The most common is that effective massage should hurt. This is not correct at all, there are many techniques for massage that are used to relieve muscle tension and sometimes going gung-ho on a muscle is not what it needs.” So don’t be afraid to ask your masseur to back off a bit: there are no prizes for enduring agony. Sleep is essential for recovery. However, this also comes under the “great idea in theory, hard in practice” rule. I have never slept well after a marathon. You are riding an adrenaline high (or, though I hope not, a crashing low) and every muscle in your legs is twitching and your system just can’t seem to shut down. Don’t worry – this is perfectly normal. Just rest. Don’t reach for the phone, just try to relax, listen to an audiobook, have another bath ... whatever helps you to drift off again. You’ll no doubt catch up and sleep like a log on subsequent nights.If your legs don’t feel like they fought a war the next day – and the day after that – then did you really run that marathon? But at what point do you know if it’s just a sore muscle, or something worse. “Doms can start a few hours after your exercise and will often peak at about 48-72 hrs, but can last up to even a week,” says Smith. “A lot of people find some gentle massaging and stretching can be helpful. If the pain lasts longer than a week or gets worse then I would suggest seeking some medical advice from a physio or doctor.” To some of you, that will be a no-brainer. Those legs are barely coping with stairs, let alone the idea of running again any time soon. Others, riding an adrenaline high, will be twitching to get back out there again after a few days. Don’t. You have nothing to gain, and a lot of torn muscle fibres that need to heal. If you crave being active, go for a swim, or do a gentle yoga class, but do not feel guilty about not doing any exercise if you don’t feel like it. Remember that elite athletes take a minimum of two very, very easy weeks to recover from a marathon, some longer. If you just want to get outside, gentle walking is a great way to stretch out sore legs.Your immune system, as well as your legs, has just taken a battering. Many people come down with a minor bug in the week after a marathon. So look after yourself, and try to eat healthily. Sure, you deserve celebratory treats, but your body needs to rebuild so be nice to it, and give it the micronutrients it deserves. As well as the cake. But don’t be surprised if elation soon turns to a touch of the blues. You’ve spent months planning and training for this event, and suddenly there’s a hole. Start thinking to the future: while you need to rest and recover, there’s no harm in starting to think of your next challenge. Follow all this advice (and if you have, you’re doing better than me. As my mum would say: “Do as I say, not as I do”) and you’ll soon – but not too soon – be back and raring to go. Use that marathon fitness and see what it can do to your 5k or 10k times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8526f93b23f30654de46214dcf8ed396298f1e47/169_335_1441_865/master/1441.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aba73ce3b9659f9eee8869412ef62b20","title":"jack monroe twitter labour vegan pub food","story":"As she turns 30, the activist and writer discusses social media, vegan pub food and her on-off love for LabourI imagine any time you meet Jack Monroe it always feels a bit like you have interrupted her mid-story. There is a brilliant indiscretion about her, as if her life is not entirely contained and you have turned up in the nick of time to try to help her keep a handle on it. On a Monday lunchtime last month she was in the big downstairs bar of the Railway Hotel in Southend-on-Sea, her local since she was in her teens, bunged up with a heavy cold, sniffing and apologising for sniffing.The Railway is designed to welcome strong characters. There is a pulpit at one end of the pub housing a DJ deck, as well as a drum kit and piano waiting for a band upstairs rooms promise art classes and poetry readings. “They put on a music class for people with learning difficulties, which is bonkers and fantastic, all tambourines and trumpets,” Monroe explains. The pub has been run for a decade by Dave and Fi Dulake, who are something of a Southend institution. “When they got married,” Monroe recalls, “they rode a tandem through town and people were coming out and cheering, running along behind, playing instruments. It was like our equivalent of a royal wedding.”The other reason she has chosen to come here is that the Railway serves some of the best vegan pub food around. “It went vegan about five years ago, long before I did,” Monroe says. “And it was one of the catalysts to make me realise vegan food could be really yummy.” (The other catalyst in her decision was a blog she wrote about visiting a slaughterhouse, the images and noises of which have never left her).I came to Southend and wrote a story about Monroe for this magazine four years ago. She was then still starting out on a journey that had begun when she blogged about trying to feed herself and her young son while living on desperately uncertain benefits, having lost her job with the local fire service. Since then it seems she has lived several lives. She has become a best-selling food writer and an indomitable campaigner against political austerity and for genderqueer rights (having identified as lesbian back then, she is now happily non-binary, though equally happy to be called “she” until someone comes up with a better pronoun). She has moved in to central London and then out again. She now lives at nearby Leigh-on-Sea, with her partner, a news editor at the BBC. “I need to live by the water. It is what keeps me sane. A pond just won’t cut it.” She has also – in an act that should afford her lifelong national treasure status – taken Katie Hopkins to court for libelling her on Twitter, and won a settlement against the former Mail Online columnist.When we meet, Monroe is eyeing up her 30th birthday the following week, a milestone that she seems determined to celebrate with abstention. She has given up drinking – partly because of the medication she is on for recently diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis. She is also cold turkeying from social media.“Twitter became like any addiction: ‘This makes me feel terrible! I want more of it!’ It is not productive. I have done more work in the last five days than for ages.”There was a point, she admits, when she had nine anonymised Twitter accounts, for various arguments, including a Scottish one, Benedict Cumberscotch, for the Scottish independence debate. Another was reserved to follow rightwingers she wanted to keep an eye on – “You know, all of the BNP plus Katie Hopkins.” She says she was trying to explain what it was like the other day to her mum. “I told her imagine going into work every morning and before you get to your desk everyone turning round to you and shouting: ‘You’re fat! You’re shit! You look like a minger!’ It’s a tough working environment …”She is currently testing food for a new book. She had her best version of macaroni cheese for breakfast and decides she will have it again now, too, because she wants to test theirs against hers. I have a vegan fish and chips, (recent winner of “Best Vegan Seafood Dish at the PETA food awards”) which turns out to be an almost Heston-like trompe l’oeil of a platter, with a big beer-battered “fish” that is a magically flaky blend of tapoica, wheat starch and knojac, served with hand-cut chips, pea puree and homemade tartare sauce.I ask Monroe about her current politics. She has fallen in and out of love with the Labour party. She was a fan of Ed Miliband, initially very sceptical of Jeremy Corbyn, mostly for his soft stance on the IRA (Monroe’s mother is northern Irish and she grew up on tales of the Troubles.) “I left for a bit, like a teenager, stomping about and slamming doors … Then after Jo Cox was murdered I grew up quite sharply,” she says. There was a time when she was thinking of running for selection as a Labour MP, and she does not rule that out. Her first act, she suggests, would be to try to organise “some kind of trade of Kate Hoey for Anna Soubry”.Monroe would make a terrific parliamentarian you can’t help feeling, though the Speaker might quickly be sensing the appeal of early retirement. You’d have to have a hard heart not to be swayed by her when she is in her stride, whether talking about animal welfare, or poverty, or (as the daughter of a firefighter and as a former station switchboard operator) Grenfell Tower. It was that authentic ability to cut through to the emotional core of our inequalities that first brought her a public and a platform. Bits of her early blogs went pretty much verbatim into Ken Loach’s film I, Daniel Blake – she had to walk out of the screening she went to because it all still seemed too hard to remember.There have been the inevitable attempts to co-opt her as a “celebrity” – offers to go into the jungle – which she has so far resisted. “I am actually holding out for Strictly,” she says, mostly in earnest. “Though I’d need to do it in the next couple of years before my joints give up.”We are on to puddings by now. She has a plate of banana fritters, which remind her of those that her dad used to get for her on the special occasions they had a Chinese takeaway.While we eat we talk a bit about her court case. Hopkins had suggested, entirely falsely, that Monroe had approved of defacing a war memorial. “I couldn’t let it go,” she says. “My brother served in Iraq. It was a very specific allegation which she refused to withdraw.”Though Hopkins did not face her in court, Monroe was subjected to three days of cross-examination in which she was required to read out the highlights of her own Twitter past. Referencing an old exchange with Piers Morgan, for example, she had to “explain to my learned friend how the word ‘twunt’ was a personal portmanteau of the words ‘twat’ and ‘cunt’, because neither seemed quite enough on its own …”The barrister was at pains to make Hopkins’s claims seem like “just words on the internet”. In response to that Monroe had six A4 ring binders of the abuse she had been sent some saying she would be pushed off a cliff or shot in the back of the head. She read them out, “crying and shaking – I said, ‘Imagine getting those words when you are trying to read your son a bedtime story.’”One of the benefits of winning the case is that the tabloid press has given her a wider berth since, she says. Walking to the train station she explains, irrepressibly, how much she is enjoying a slightly lower profile, a slightly more measured life. “I am not saying anything revolutionary,” she says. “Mostly I am just trying to make beans taste OK and saying that people need a decent place to live.” She joins me on the train back to London, and in the middle of a breathless story about fires she has helped to put out, just about manages to jump off at her stop.Cooking on a Bootstrap by Jack Monroe is published by Bluebird in August"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9195c74f429e0cff3872ac85018a123c6040f194/0_277_5897_3537/master/5897.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=427160c57b7e2d51bb2a4a722667e8ce","title":"my older partner nags me to be organised but im just forgetful","story":"Step up to your responsibilities and stop conjuring excuses, advises Mariella Frostrup, to a young woman who won’t stand up for herselfThe dilemma I am 29 and my partner is 36. We’ve been together for four years. I had a child when I was a teenager, and my partner has become an incredible father to him – yet suddenly the age gap between us feels problematic. He seems constantly on my case about “sorting things out”, whether it’s asking the school about upcoming exams or my manager how much holiday I’m owed. I am forgetful, so I don’t blame him for reminding me, but I’m not an assertive person and often when I speak to the school office, or my boss, or the council or any kind of authority I get fobbed off and wouldn’t even know how to argue.It’s got to the point where I dread him coming home from work, because he starts asking what progress I’ve made. But then I think he is right to hassle me, because these things do need to get done and I am an adult who ought to be capable of doing them. Perhaps I am unhappy because my life is a mess compared to his. It feels like his head is in paperwork and my head is in the clouds. I’m unhappy because he is trying to drag me down – and this is all that our relationship is now. How do we get happy again? Do I need to grow up, or does he need to loosen up?Mariella replies Both! That’s the short answer. There’s no more effective passion killer than responsibility – and we all struggle to incorporate both into our lives. It’s no wonder most epic romances play out before we hit 30, whether in pop songs, novels, films or real life, when the pressures of life have yet to assert themselves. Carefree behaviour relies on being carefree (or plain irresponsible) and few adults can lay claim to that halcyon state.You and your partner appear to have reached a serious juncture. He’s pushing you to grab the reins and you’re pushing against change to the status quo. It’s possible he’s a total killjoy, prematurely settling into pipe and slippers, or overly controlling, but I do wonder why you are so resistant to taking charge of your own destiny. In youth, evading chores is a challenge in adulthood it’s not a virtue. You can keep your head in the clouds only so long as someone else has their feet on the ground.It seems a particularly unjust ision of labour for your partner to be the one nagging you to check on your child’s school schedule. You know you need to step up to your responsibilities and stop conjuring excuses. The “age gap” between you is a particularly unconvincing argument as he’s probably equally unhappy about returning home from work to nag you about the basics of your own life. You may not want your relationship to boil down to such mundanities, but only by taking care of them can you clear the decks for the “happiness” you seek. School holidays, exam dates, domestic administration are tedious details essential to the infrastructure of our daily lives. Living in ignorance doesn’t make things go away. In fact, problems tend to expand while we’re dodging them.I’m wondering if you’re not just oppressed by minutiae but also a little bit depressed. Describing your life as a mess is an admission of powerlessness. Whether you and your partner stay together or not, it’s simply not an option to float along and expect things to simply work out or others to shoulder the responsibility. There comes a time in all our lives when we can no longer throw our hands up in the air in helplessness with any credibility. Saying that you’re forgetful, wouldn’t know how to argue and that you are not an assertive person isn’t acceptable justification for failing to tackle what needs doing.The challenge with getting together young is how much we alter and, when we’re older, how stuck in our ways we become. Although you sound like a recalcitrant child being forced into an adult lifestyle, I don’t think age is the issue here. Some people embrace administration with a relish, others are reluctant guests at that table. Clearly, and perhaps luckily for you, you hooked up with a responsible adult who likes life to be organised. I’m sure that was a blessing when you were a young single parent, but as you develop into maturity it may no longer seem such a gift. It is also not what you want the defining characteristic of your relationship to be.It is dispiriting how quickly romance can switch to mundanity, especially when there’s a child’s life to be organised, but if you both roll up your sleeves, establish your roles and get on with the chores it should be perfectly possible to carve out some time for joy. All work and no play may make Jack a dull boy, but the opposite would be even more tedious! There’s room for all sorts in this world, but playing to our strengths and teaming up to combat our weaknesses are essential survival skills.If there’s something more clinical at the heart of your inability to take control the best place to start is your GP. One of the clearest indications of depression is being stuck in a rut and I can’t decide whether it’s that, or a stubborn determination to keep to your comfort zone that’s causing your troubles. Working that out should be top of your list of tasks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf6c992ae61b9cd641336dccdfc5ff8db048710c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b2b1e48a5318da6e918756a36cbcb58","title":"taste test falafel ice cream sandwiches vegetarian vegan snacks","story":"Meera Sodha rates high street sandwiches, pasta, burgers and moreTesco Wicked Kitchen smashin’ pumpkin falafel£3, tesco.comI like the colour.

Then Brexit happened. He tells the Observer of his fears and hopes for manufacturing, trade and investmentKoji Tsuruoka is sipping green tea in Japan’s splendid embassy in Mayfair, recalling how his first two years as Japan’s ambassador to the UK have not gone quite according to plan. At least, they haven’t turned out how his predecessors assured him they would. One after another, ex-ambassadors advised him, before he took up the position on 6 June 2016, that he would find the UK very “stable”, and its politics “very predictable”.A year later, after the Brexit bombshell caused global diplomatic and economic panic that reached Tokyo, Theresa May called a surprise general election that threw everything up in the air again. Thinking back to that period of turbulence, Tsuruoka stops for a few seconds and glances out of the window in the direction of Buckingham Palace. “Now I have to keep in mind that you don’t predict what is going to happen in the UK.”That said, he does quickly predict, in his diplomatic and soft-spoken way, that Brexit will bring considerable economic uncertainty to this country, in the short term at least. He spells out how decades of ever-increasing Japanese investment into the UK have already come to a halt for the time being. He is well qualified to judge how Brexit will pan out. Before coming to London, Tsuruoka spent three intense years negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that aims to reduce barriers between the US, Japan and 10 other Pacific nations. He knows as much as anyone about how international trade flows work, and about what is possible and what is not.This account of a relationship that strengthened year after year – in a period during which the UK was in the EU – raises a very obvious question. Will it continue to thrive after we have left? He replies decisively. “One thing I can say for certain, based on fact, is that the companies operating today in the UK are not expanding their investment in the UK today.”Huge Japanese firms with big plants in the UK – such as Nissan and Toyota, who sell most of their British-made cars into the EU – are, he says, treading water, biding their time before deciding whether to relocate part or all of their businesses, so they can continue to be based inside the single market after March 2019. He tries not to sound alarming, but is clear about the threat to UK jobs. “They are currently considering and thinking and watching very closely what they need to do. That is why they are not investing additionally today.“If you are proposing in your board meeting in a company that you need to invest more and build more cars in the UK today today there will be questions, and those are questions that are very difficult to answer today with certainty and therefore decisions are put off.”For Japanese enterprises which came to the UK to sell into EU markets, tariff-free trade is the guiding star that decides where they locate.“The reason that many of those companies have come is that this is the best gateway to Europe,” he says. “If that is in danger, if that is no longer sustainable, of course they will have to look at what they will have to do best. The existing arrangement for the single market is a total frictionless trade.”He believes membership of the single market is as good as it gets for Japanese firms wanting to sell into the EU from European bases. “The EU is a very exceptional single market. I don’t think the single market could be substituted by something and be better or even be the same.”It is not a uniform picture across the whole economy. There are sectors, such as software design, where the UK is still attractive, as it has the R\u0026ampD expertise and skills. He cites the example of how Japan’s SoftBank agreed, after the referendum, to buy the British software design firm Arm Holdings for £24.3bn in the hope that it would become a global leader.“That is one representation of what will go on and that was based on the assessment that the R\u0026ampD, the hi-tech capability, the potential for the UK succeeding further in this area, was quite concrete… those technologies are not necessarily linked to the EU.”Factory-based businesses, however – those producing goods for European markets rather than merely designing them – are a very “different issue”. They face real uncertainties if and when the terms of trade change. So too do Japanese financial institutions in the City, Japanese banks and other organisations offering financial services.The fact they will no longer have passporting rights to operate into EU markets will have significant effects on employment here. “It is an issue – because having passporting rights to reach the single market and be part of the single market is a very efficient and cost-saving way of conducting financial services which is a regulated industry.” Will Japanese banks up sticks and go? No, he says, not lock, stock and barrel, because Europe is just part of their market. But jobs will head out of the City into the EU and Japanese companies will have to reduce their operations in London. “They are not leaving London, because London is a global financial centre, not just a centre for the EU – but they will have to relocate some of their EU business to the EU in order to continue serving the EU consumers.”He is at pains not to talk down the UK’s post-Brexit prospects. Just as no one thought Brexit would happen when he arrived, no one can know for definite that it will turn out badly, as it approaches.“If you take a longer term, five, 10, 20 years… things become more unpredictable,” he says. But he is clear that in the shorter term it will not be good for the UK economy nor the strength of its economic partnership with Japan.He says Japan has not yet begun talks with the UK on a post-Brexit trade deal and that it would take several years to complete, if one is struck at all. It is another area of real uncertainty in the entirely unpredictable post-Brexit world that he never expected to encounter on arriving in London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f956ae3020ff1d9e2c8879f5e73b26bcb010fdc/500_799_5085_3051/master/5085.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c606317e8581ad743342548da66cfc5a","title":"tower hamlets labour win in londons diverse borough is far from certain","story":"Mayoral hopeful Rabina Khan aims to forge a new coalition in the ethnically erse London boroughA team of half a dozen Labour leafleters wait outside an East End primary school on a warm afternoon just off Roman Road street market in the gentrifying suburb of Bow. The party’s message is that schools are facing spending cuts imposed by the central government the target audience is the predominantly Bengali women picking up children, a group that party campaigners otherwise struggle to reach in an area where the Bangladeshi vote is critical.Outside the school is the diminutive figure of John Biggs, the incumbent directly elected mayor. But the Labour politician’s path to the top job in the borough that contains the gleaming towers of Canary Wharf and the traditional East End has been anything but easy. This time around Biggs faces the same principal opponent, Rabina Khan, a local councillor who leads the People’s Alliance for Tower Hamlets (Path), but much else has changed. Rahman, who once backed Khan, is now supporting another independent candidate, the Aspire party’s Ohid Ahmed. With Labour’s popularity in London greater than it was in 2105, and his principal opponents ided, it appears to be Biggs’s election to lose.“When I became mayor it was the end of a period of some controversy in the borough. The easy bit was clearing out the politics the harder bit was improving the quality of our services,” Biggs says, arguing that Labour is the only party that represents the borough as a whole.“Whatever Lutfur Rahman did, whether it was good or bad, it was about a very isive politics that was very segregated. He predominately focused on one community.”However, Khan believes she can put together an alternative coalition to take on Labour. The Bengali councillor talks about “a Tower Hamlets for all” and says she would like to create “a cross-party cabinet with all the political groups”. If you’re living in an area going to the polls in May we want to hear from you. Let us know which way you’re thinking of voting, and which issues are most crucial to you locally.You can share your thoughts using our encrypted form here. One of our journalists may contact you to discuss further and we will feature some of your contributions in our reporting.Khan emphasises how she has “shared a platform with the Green party, challenging austerity measures” that she says were implemented by Labour. “We have to learn from Tower Hamlets right from the beginning. Let’s not forget Cable Street when Oswald Mosley and his blackshirts tried to march through and people came together,” Khan says, and highlights the need to combat Islamophobia and antisemitism in the borough today.At Tower Hamlets, the mayor appoints a cabinet, although most of the power resides in the directly elected leader, who needs the support of the full council to ensure the budget is passed.Khan was a cabinet member for housing when Rahman was executive mayor. She says her experience of the time, in obtaining funding from Boris Johnson’s mayoralty, demonstrates that it is possible for council leaders to succeed outside the mainstream political parties. “I was 1,400 votes behind Biggs last time on first preferences, and he had a party machinery against me,” she adds.But such is her falling-out with Rahman-backed Ahmed, (who did not respond to requests for an interview by the Guardian) that the two were reportedly engaged in a public “shouting match” at a community centre. Some independent locals say it is far from certain that second-preference votes would transfer from Khan’s Path to Ahmed’s Aspire or vice versa in an anti-Labour challenge. In 2015 Biggs won over Khan by 27,255 against 25,763 in the first round. But the Labour candidate won 5,499 second preferences against 621 for Khan.Such personality-driven politics is arguably encouraged by a system of directly elected mayors, used only by a minority of London boroughs. Without it Rahman would probably not have become Britain’s first directly elected Muslim mayor in 2010 after the Labour party stripped him of his nomination.Biggs says that brought with it further difficulties. “The problem was that Lutfur Rahman tested what happens when you get a maverick person elected,” he adds.In neighbouring Newham, where Labour is expected to win easily, the party’s first-time mayoral candidate, Rokhsana Fiaz, wants to have a referendum on whether to continue the system after she wrested the nomination from Sir Robin Wales who had been mayor and the borough’s dominating presence since 2002. Fiaz emphasises a more personal tone and she wants to consult residents on major decisions and developments by using citizen assemblies. She says: “I can understand why people might feel cynical. But I am committed, my instinct is to be very open and involving. The council has become too remote.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee17e2273717f67beda3abae8fe170c1d197d072/0_131_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5e5e00bfe8141e8918947c0330e05db","title":"welsh finance minister mark drakeford carwyn jones","story":"Labour leader heralds ‘tireless’ work of Carwyn Jones, who announced departure after pressure over the death of Carl Sargeant Jeremy Corbyn has brushed off the idea that the Welsh first minister is leaving office under a cloud after Carwyn Jones announced he was stepping down as the pressure over the death of Carl Sargeant intensified.Corbyn thanked Jones for his “tireless” work as leader of Labour in Wales and said he had been a strong voice for democracy, devolution and standing up for the Welsh people. Asked if Jones was leaving under a cloud, Corbyn said that he was departing with a great deal of affection. However, there is little doubt that Jones’s nine-year spell as first minister will be most remembered for the tragedy of Sargeant, who killed himself shortly after he was sacked by Jones amid allegations of harassment.  Among the early front-runners to take over is Mark Drakeford, the finance secretary, who said he was thinking “very seriously” about standing. Another possible candidate is Vaughan Gething, who five years ago became the first black minister in any devolved UK administration.A row is already brewing over how the new first minister will be elected.Shortly before Jones announced he was stepping down, the Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris won the Welsh Labour deputy leadership election through an electoral college system – rather than one member, one vote.Her rival Julie Morgan, whose late husband, Rhodri, was first minister before Jones, lost despite being backed by more party members.  There are already growing calls for the new Labour leader in Wales to be elected under one member one vote. Corbyn said the method used was up to the Welsh Labour party.  Announcing his departure, which will not be until the autumn, Jones said he had faced the “darkest times” in recent months.  He has been under intense pressure since Sargeant’s death and his position had been made more awkward by the election of Sargeant’s son, Jack, to the Alyn and Deeside seat in north Wales.  The pressure on Jones increased last week when opposition parties in Wales fiercely criticised the government for blocking the full publication of a report examining claims that news of Sargeant’s dismissal was leaked in the days before his death. Jones’s announcement came a day after lawyers for Jack Sargeant published a letter accusing Jones of causing considerable distress. The main inquiry into the Sargeant affair has not yet begun and Jones promised that he would answer every question asked.  Jones’s departure means the loss of an experienced election campaign leader, who guided Welsh Labour to a string of victories.  Together with the Scottish nationalists, he has also played an important role in holding the UK government to account over Brexit. There is a danger that his announcement will weaken the position of the Welsh-Scottish position on Brexit.  Until the Sargeant tragedy, Jones was regarded as a safe pair of hands who, while not as charismatic or well-known as Rhodri Morgan, appealed to a broad range of voters and Labour party activists.After the defeat of the Labour party in the 2010 UK general election and the resignation of Gordon Brown as prime minister, Jones became the most senior Labour leader in power. Since then one of his missions has been to protect Wales against the impacts of austerity. His government’s record in the devolved areas of education and health have been frequently attacked by political opponents in Westminster, but he has defended his administration robustly.  Under his watch the Welsh assembly has been given power to make its own laws and to raise some tax revenues. Jones, who is married with two children, is particularly proud of a landmark scheme under which people are deemed to have consented to organ donation unless they opt out that has been credited with saving lives.  In an interview with the Guardian shortly before Sargeant’s death to mark the 20th anniversary of Welsh devolution he said he believed that Wales was more successful and confident than two decades ago.  He himself was also much more confident, buoyed by excellent results in the general election and said he was still enjoying the top job and was not thinking of stepping down any time soon.

Yet both Kipchoge and Farah were in a group of athletes who set off at a startlingly fast pace and covered the first 13.1 miles in 61 minutes, well inside the world record of 2hr 02min 57sec.It was always going to a grim test of survival after that. And so it proved. Unsurprisingly it was Kipchoge, the Yoda of distance running, who coped better than anyone, breaking away from the Ethiopian Tola Kitata after 24 miles to win by 33sec in 2hr 04min 17sec.Farah was left to rue starting too fast. “I am knackered,” he said. “The guys just went for it. They went at world record pace. It was do or die. I hung as much as I could but it is so different to the track – it is different pain.”Farah now, incredibly, holds the British records over 1,500m, 3,000m, 5,000m, 10,000m, the half-marathon and the marathon. His performance will inspire awe in some quarters and suspicion in others given his former coach Alberto Salazar, who turned him from a world-level runner into a world-beater, remains under investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency.Meanwhile the 35-year-old will rightly believe he can go faster in the future. He certainly did not help his cause by failing to pick up his drink at the 10km feeding station – something he blamed on volunteers wanting to take pictures rather than helping him.“At the drinks station was quite a confusion,” he said. “I was table four, but the staff was trying to take pictures and I was trying to take a drink.He ended up speaking to a motorbike rider afterwards – “I was telling the staff, can you just tell them to be a bit more helpful” – but then at 20km he picked up and dropped his bottle, losing valuable metres.“Me and the other athlete from Ethiopia had the exact same bottle and were on the same table, too. So when I was trying to grab my drink I was grabbing his drink and he was grabbing my drink. So I was telling the people: ‘Can you please just tell us which one is our drink because it’s exactly the same bottle.’”Perhaps we should not have been that surprised. For while he was back on familiar turf, close to the scene of his Olympic 5,000m and 10,000m triumphs at London 2012, the marathon remains alien territory. But as Paula Radcliffe rightly pointed out on the BBC commentary, he could have avoided the problem of identifying his correct bottle by making it more distinctive.Yet despite his lack of bottle Farah was still in contention deep into the race, even moving up to hang on Kipchoge’s shoulder after 18 miles. But it was the briefest of mirages. Soon he was slipping backwards, leaving Kipchoge and Kitata to duke it out at the front.Yet Farah is optimistic that his time has proved that he could cut it as an elite marathon runner. “If I can run 2hr 06min here in a major championship, it shows I can be competitive,” he said. “I’ve beaten some good runners. I’m satisfied with the result. I can’t do any better than what I did. I got a personal best, I won with a pacer, I fought as much as I could.“Eliud is a great marathon runner who has many experiences with the marathon, and today is one of those things you be a man, fight like a man, or start off in the back and regret it later on. I fought as much as I could. After 30K, I was definitely feeling it obviously with the pace slowed down a bit, I was tired but managed to hang in there and come away third.”Behind him was the great Ethiopian Kenenisa Bekele, who finished seventh in 2hr 08min 53sec after blowing up in the second half, while the 2017 winner Daniel Wanjiru was a spot further back having trudged home in 2hr 09min 25sec."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bc94f87863d262d3da7b7b3642e6a488ccb57e6/299_151_3737_2243/master/3737.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c6d1f8ae174566072834a103e0035e6","title":"rafael nadal wins record monte carlo masters","story":"Rafael Nadal powered to a record 11th Monte-Carlo Masters title with a straight-sets victory over Kei Nishikori.The world No 1 recovered from going a break down early in the first set to win 6-3 6-2 in 93 minutes and has now won 36 consecutive sets on clay, a run which stretches back to the first round of last year’s French Open.None of Nadal’s opponents have won more than four games in any of those sets, a statistic Nishikori looked like changing when he broke for a 2-1 lead at Monte Carlo Country Club.However, Nadal had other ideas and broke straight back on his way to winning five of the next six games, the 31-year-old then broke Nishikori twice more in the second set to seal a 31st Masters 1000 title, one more than Novak Djokovic.Nadal said: “I want to thank all my team and my family. We had some tough moments during the last five months after a couple of injuries in a row. It’s great to have a group of great people behind me. I can say thank you very much always for being there and supporting me when I really need it.“It’s always special for me to be back here, having this trophy. It’s one of the most important events of the year for me.”After retiring with a hip injury during his Australian Open quarter-final against Marin Cilic, Nadal withdrew from the Mexican Open, Indian Wells Masters and Miami Open due to the problem.Meanwhile Great Britain captain Anne Keothavong defended her decision to send out Johanna Konta and Heather Watson for the decisive doubles tie after suffering Fed Cup defeat in Miki.Britain’s wait to play in the World Group will continue after they were beaten 3-2 by Japan in their promotion play-off - Konta and Watson losing the deciding doubles rubber to Miyu Kato and Makoto Ninomiya 3-6 6-3 6-3.Anna Smith and debutant Gabi Taylor were the original nominations for the doubles but Keothavong replaced them with the more experienced pairing after Watson lost Sunday’s second singles match.“We are gutted about the result.

She’s one of 300 running for Alzheimer’s research, but is the only one suffering and hopes there’ll be more in the future.Chelsea and Southampton kick-off in 54 minutes, the winners to meet Manchester United in the FA Cup final. Rob Smyth has all the news on that.There are two men in a batmobile, dressed as Batman and Robin. And oh look, there’s a man who reckons he’s dressed as Big Ben, not knowing that’s actually the bell not the tower. But no one asks him to give an interview and I simply can’t believe he’s been silenced in this way, Brexit means Brexit. How I’m going to spend tomorrow:These aerial shots of London are amazing. I wish we had authorities able to look after the people who make it actually amazing. We’re now seeing an insert about Stephen’s team, running in memory of Stephen Lawrence who was murdered 25 years ago today. Doreen Lawrence is one of the heroes of our time. Here’s one: Radcliffe says she’s relieved to still have her record. I dunno, and wonder if she’d feel that way if she’d won Olympic golds. Don’t athletes quite like it when their sport moves on? Remember Ian Botham when James Anderson beat his record of most wickets for England? Michael Johnson when Wayde van Niekerk beat his 400m mark?As far as I can see, those times are almost identical to the ones I entered earlier I don’t know. Kipchoge finished in 2.04:17 and Farah in 2.06:21. Paula Radcliffe is back and has, you’ll be relieved to know, really enjoyed her day. She reckons both elite races were good, which they were. Elsewhere, Arsenal and West Ham are drawing 0-0 - Jacob Steinberg has the latest. Wenger out! And livebloggers. Won’t someone please think of the livebloggers. The Paddington lot are in their work gear. “We were advised to take it off after a mile but we felt very strongly that we should keep it on.” It’s pretty moving hearing them speak. The North Ken firemen have paused to give an interview. They’re running for Kids on the Green, and have a big green hat made for them by those kids which they’re taking it in turns to wear. As we saw much earlier, the Grenfell fire brigade heroes are running to raise money for those who were affected. Absolute legends. Some running club types are singing Here Comes The Sun, and have a guitar. Colin Jackson is interviewing someone dressed as something who was going for some kind of record. He’s running for Dimbleby Cancer Care. Callum Hawkins is here, and he’s in good nick it’s good to see. He stayed a few extra days in Australia, and says he’d been feeling fine until then and remembers his legs going to jelly but not everything thereafter. Thanks Will and hello again. We’ve just seen a man dressed Darth Vader – at least I think it was a man dressed as Darth Vader – with speakers strapped to him playing dark side tunes. Your man Daniel Harris is thoroughly refreshed so will keep you updated on runners being very warm. CheersColin Jackson is VERY excited about drumming. Now lots of sponsored people are hitting drums with minimal rhythm. That will get the runners energised."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e39902bdb4da73a3a8e36f3b791117fdfef7d1b3/0_97_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c34fdb01bd9e4a5801f5e3b38f22792e","title":"arizona republicans seek law change in case john mccain seat in play","story":"GOP move would change state’s process for replacing members of Congress who resign or die in officeArizona lawmakers are debating legislation that would keep John McCain’s Senate successor off the ballot in November’s midterm elections, should the seat become open before the end of next month.The bill, which could come up for a vote this week, would change the state’s process for replacing members of Congress who resign or die in office. Though Democrats are expected block the measure, the effort has renewed speculation about McCain’s health.McCain, a six-term Arizona senator and 2008 Republican presidential nominee, was diagnosed last summer with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. The 81-year-old has been with his family, absent from Washington, since December. State Democrats accused Republicans of playing politics with the bill by trying to eliminate the possibility of two open US Senate seats in a year when the state could determine control of Congress. Nationally, the historic unpopularity of Donald Trump is fueling talk of sweeping Democratic gains.Arizona Republicans are already defending the seat that will be vacated by retiring senator Jeff Flake. The battle to replace him is expected to be one of the fiercest – and most expensive – midterm races.Republicans say that is not the their intent. Steve Yarbrough, the Arizona senate president, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian. But he recently told the Hill: “I think everybody was just trying to make this process fair. I think it’s unfortunately probably much ado about little. It’s not like this is going to create some advantage.”Debate on the issue erupted this week, when Republicans moved to amend the legislation one day after McCain’s office announced that he had undergone surgery related to an intestinal infection.In the event McCain’s seat becomesopen, Governor Doug Ducey, a Republican also up for re-election this year, will make an appointment. The seat would appear on the next general election ballot.The Arizona secretary of state’s office has said that if the vacancy occurs before 31 May, voters will elect a new senator in this year’s general election. If the seat opens after that date, the appointee will serve through 2020. By introducing an “emergency clause” to the bill concerning succession to vacated congressional seats, state senate Republicans proposed changing that deadline to 150 days prior to a regular primary election, or 31 March of this year. That would ensure that McCain’s seat did not appear on the ballot in November. Without the emergency clause, the legislation would not take effect in time to impact the 2018 election.The legislation was originally a bipartisan effort to clarify existing law on special elections, prompted by the resignation of Trent Franks, a US representative who stepped down in December amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Farley said the emergency clause, which requires a two-thirds vote, was added “quietly” and “without debate”. Republicans will need support from several Democrats to pass the bill as amended. Farley said that will not happen.And even if the bill were to pass the Arizona Senate next week, it would still need to be approved by the state House. Whether Governor Ducey would sign such legislation also remains uncertain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f4d4f8dea2f2b702a36ed4b582a9180a99b429c/0_454_3867_2320/master/3867.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=865fe58a302591139f39ef6378ff6a36","title":"identity checks election disenfranchise ethnic minorities","story":"New rules ‘will deter migrant voters’, watchdog claims, adding to Windrush scandalGovernment plans that will force people to prove their identities at polling stations in May’s local elections risk disenfranchising members of ethnic minority communities, according to a leaked letter to ministers from the equality and human rights watchdog.In a move that will fuel controversy over the treatment of migrants in the UK following the Windrush scandal, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has written to the Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, raising its serious concern that the checks will deter immigrants and others from participating in the democratic process.The Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the plan for compulsory checks was more evidence of the kind of “hostile environment” that Theresa May’s government wanted to create for people who had come to settle in Britain. In a speech on Sunday, Corbyn will claim that Theresa May’s determination to cut immigration at all costs was responsible for the Windrush scandal. He will say: “British citizens who came to our country to rebuild it after the war have faced deportation because they couldn’t clear the deliberately unreachable bar set by Theresa May’s ‘hostile environment’ for migrants.”Under the new government voting rules, being trialled in several local authorities at the 3 May local elections, people will be asked at polling stations to produce documents proving their identity – such as a passport or driving licence – before casting their vote. Currently, no such proof is required.The Windrush scandal has highlighted how many who came to this country from the Caribbean, mainly in the late 1950s, have struggled to prove their British citizenship because the authorities failed to register them or destroyed their landing cards, or because they have never applied for documents such as passports.Ministers say the pilot projects are being run – with a view to adopting them nationwide if they are successful – in response to concerns about electoral fraud.But in a letter to Lidington, and leaked to the Observer, the EHRC says evidence of supposed fraud is minimal and warns that there is a real risk that legal residents who might not have a passport or driving licence – or might be reluctant to produce them at polling stations – could be disenfranchised as a result.In the letter, the EHRC’s legal officer, Claire Collier, tells Lidington: “The Commission is concerned that the requirement to produce identification at the given local elections (Bromley, Gosport, Swindon, Watford and Woking) will have a disproportionate impact on voters with protected characteristics, particularly older people, transgender people, people with disabilities andor those from ethnic minority communities. In essence, there is a concern that some voters will be disenfranchised as a result of restrictive identification requirements.”Reacting to the news, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: “Forcing voters at election time to prove their identity at polling stations by producing official documents would have a disproportionate impact on people from black and ethnic minority communities.“It is the same hostile environment all over again, shutting our fellow citizens out of public life, treating communities who made Britain their home as second-class citizens. It’s disgraceful and it must be brought to an end.”Kunle Olulode, the director of Voice4Change England, a civil society charity that has worked with the government to improve the participation of BME communities in elections said: “We feel strongly that this type of policy will not only have minimal impact on the miniscule level of voting fraud but will create potentially new and unnecessary barriers to participation in the electoral process if people become uncertain of requirements when they turn up at polling stations, further impacting negatively on registrations. Asking for voters IDs as a policy certainly has echoes of the strategy aimed at making society an uncomfortable place for illegal migrants.”A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “We already ask that people prove who they are in order to collect a parcel from the post office, rent a car, or travel abroad.“We believe it is right to take the same approach to protect voting rights. Local authorities are implementing equality impact assessments and are working with partners to ensure that voter ID does not risk preventing any eligible voter from voting. It is in nobody’s interest that any elector is disenfranchised.”Last night John Sentamu, the archbishop of York, called for an inquiry into immigration policy and the Windrush scandal in which up to 50,000 mostly Commonwealth migrants are facing problems securing their citizenship, access to healthcare and other services because of Home Office demands to see proof of their rights to be here.“The truth is now out. Hard-working, tax-paying immigrants who were invited to this country to help with postwar reconstruction have been treated appallingly,” he told the Observer. “It is never too late to repent, but it is unwise for penitents to boast about their achievements. Instead, the government needs to set up an inquiry urgently to discover where other aspects of our immigration policy are treating people as less than human.”It has also emerged that the “hostile environment” for illegal immigrants was implemented despite warnings from a Tory cabinet minister that it would lead to exploitation and endanger health.Investigations show that the plan to force landlords to check the immigration status of tenants, known as the “right to rent”, was fiercely opposed before its implementation by Eric Pickles, the former communities secretary. In an internal memo written in February 2013, he warned: “It would be disproportionately burdensome, ineffective and intrusive to oblige all private landlords to satisfy themselves as to the immigration status of prospective tenants. It’s hard to assess how many illegal immigrants this policy would deter in practice as it would be easy to circumventevade detection.“Those landlordsagents who are already rogues will not obey the law – and will make more money by exploiting a niche market in illegal tenants by increasing rentscompromising on health and safety for tenants who cannot complain ... The costs and risks considerably outweigh the benefits.”Amber Rudd, the home secretary, appeared to blame her department for the Windrush scandal last week, saying: “The Home Office has become too concerned with policy and strategy and sometimes loses sight of the inidual”.However, Brodie Clark, the former head of the UK Borders Agency who resigned after being criticised by May in 2011 for relaxing passport checks to reduce immigration queues, condemned the decision to blame officials and pointed to a “political desperation” to reduce immigration.“In my time with UKBA, I had the greatest regard for frontline staff and their ability to do their jobs effectively,” he said. “They saw their job as defending the country, but doing it in a fair and decent fashion.”“To hear any political leader now saying, ‘The trouble is, they were too obsessed in delivering policy and not enough about caring for people’, just beggars belief. Civil servants are employed to deliver government policy and deviation is certainly not rewarded. It is a shameful shot, given the dedication, commitment and skill of those staff.”The National Landlords Association, the Residential Landlords Association and the lettings agents’ body ARLA Propertymark are all pushing for the “right to rent” policy to be dropped amid warnings that it is causing landlords to discriminate against people with foreign names or non-UK passports. The policy was piloted from December 2014 and rolled out across England in February 2016.A Downing Street spokesman said: “It was a Labour government which, in 2008, introduced the labour market test so that people had to evidence their status. And it is fair that only those who have a right to be here can work legally, rent property and access public services.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3e1863c08991f713cc24147686669fdead25107/1168_414_3776_2266/master/3776.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12e535a87498c3a123a85edbf38ae885","title":"germany social democrats elect first female leader andrea nahles","story":"Combative former labour minister Andrea Nahles is first woman to lead party in 155 years Germany’s centre-left Social Democrats have elected Andrea Nahles, a combative and outspoken former labour minister, as the first female leader of the 155-year-old party.Known for her lectern-thumping speeches and occasional outbursts of child-like humour, the 47-year-old single mother joins the country’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, at the top of German politics – and may one day seek her job.“We’re breaking though the glass ceiling in the SPD,” Nahles said at the delegates’ meeting in the city of Wiesbaden. “And the ceiling will stay open.”The less than stellar result against an outsider reflected lingering resentment within the party toward the decision, which Nahles strongly promoted, of govern as junior partners again to Merkel’s conservatives.Germany’s finance minister and the SPD’s interim leader, Olaf Scholz, said electing a woman was a sign of long-overdue progress and a historic moment.In the run-up to the vote, wellwishers had ironically expressed hope that Nahles would do worse than her predecessor Martin Schulz.Nahles now faces the dual challenge of governing responsibly with Merkel while convincing her party’s dwindling number of working-class voters that the SPD is still their champion.Nahles vowed that the party would fight for social justice and welfare. “Solidarity is what is most lacking in the globalised, neoliberal, turbo-digitalised world,” she said.She pledged a fight for decent wages as technology destroys traditional jobs, and a pro-EU foreign policy that emphasises pacifism and international cooperation.From the party’s left, Nahles scored some landmark successes under the previous Merkel coalition government, notably in introducing a minimum wage.When voters declined to reward the SPD for such gains, the party initially vowed a muscular fight from the opposition benches.Nahles summed up the party’s combative approach to the Merkel government at the time by telling journalists that “from tomorrow we’ll smack ’em in the face”.When it turned out that the SPD was likely to rejoin Merkel after all, but drive a tough bargain in the process, she used a kindergarten taunt that loosely translates as “na-na na-na boo-boo”.It was not out of style for Nahles, who once mocked Merkel’s party in the Bundestag with a slightly off-key rendition of the theme song of Swedish children’s book hero Pippi Longstocking.Some find such performances grating, but few underestimate Nahles who, like Merkel, is considered a hard worker and a sharp strategist and political operator."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3459762.1524066741!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"getting up close and digital with nature s miniature life","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBumblebee at broad bean flowers. Illustration: Michael VineyWith a teenager’s devotion to a wild idea, I once turned the family greenhouse into a photographic darkroom. It was the only uncontested space, and its cardboard blackout was proof against all but the brightest chinks of starlight. My first enlarger, conjured from a mysterious, fatherly deal in the pub, was an Edwardian antique of mahogany and brass. It stretched horizontally along the potting bench, the bellows extending on tracks. Its fist-size lens threw a diamond-sharp image, once I had managed to sandwich my modest square of film where the big glass plate of a negative used to go.Making a print was slow, messy and laborious, involving smelly chemicals. As I became more ambitious, the cost of a perfect 10 x 8 print, its darks rich and velvety, could be quite high. But the feeling of accomplishment, of solitary, magical creativity, was incomparable. Moving a digital image from camera to computer screen, all with a click or two, misses out on a whole slice of youthful fulfilment.My first camera, an aged twin-lens Voigtlander, could not focus nearer than a metre. With wooden tripod tied to my crossbar, I cycled off into the countryside for landscapes and quaint corners of stockbroker villages while haunted by Ansel Adams’s wild and wonderful boulders and peaks of Yosemite, borrowed from the town library.Half a century on, in the digital age, I also delight in a different scale of nature – its miniatures – as the rich flow of images from readers arrives at “Eye on Nature”. The capacity of smartphone cameras to get in close, often to a hand’s breadth of the subject, has embraced the beauty and interest of the single flower or woodland mushroom, the single beetle or bumblebee, the inidual butterfly or moth, and (I sometimes shrink to see) the poised and solitary spider. Along with the images comes the quest to know more, which Ethna tries to satisfy.Among Europe’s finest close-up photographers is Dr Robert Thompson, who is based in Banbridge, Co Down. An entomologist, he knows what everything is and where it’s likely to be. I met up with him once in the dunes along the shore and marvelled at the range of Nikon hardware clustered weightily across his chest: if not this camera, then that one, and whichever lens, tripod, knee pads or ancillary gadget needed for the shot.Thompson’s classic work has already been seen in weighty volumes of dragonflies, butterflies and moths published by the Ulster Museum. He has now produced a masterly guide, Close-up and Macro Photography: Its Art and Fieldcraft Techniques. It’s not cheap – €41 even in the hefty, large-format paperback – but it is visually thrilling and technically exhaustive.Thompson’s life as a professional natural history photographer means marketing flawless photos with impact and a personal style: “branding”, as he puts it. Along with the right exposure, white balance, colour temperature and expertise with clinical software comes an artistic gift for an image that draws a gasp.The fieldcraft offered by Thompson, moving from one habitat to another, can be beguilingly practical, as in keeping one’s head off the skyline while stalking dragonflies perched at a pond, or searching for the one mushroom the slugs haven’t got to.Wind and weather count as much as knowing where and when to look, and blue-sky, breezy days are definitely not the best. There are flexible yokes to hold a flower still (among them the wonderful “Wimberley Plamp”), tripods that sprawl obligingly flat on the ground, and screens that diffuse the overly harsh light of bright sun.Early morning finds the light kindest and insects still torpidly waiting to be warmed into life. When they’re flying, a light shower of rain can bring them down to the leaves and add sparkling drops to a flower or a dragonfly’s wing. In winter, soft mist can bejewel a spider’s web or frost coat a seed head or berry in diamonds.Close-up and “macro” photography are not the same: the latter means images often greatly enlarged from life. Not everyone enjoys inspecting the glaze on a wasp’s eyeball. Thompson usually settles for doubling the size, perhaps with telephoto lens and extension tube. If there is a special style to his work, it shows up well in his exquisite studies of day-flying moths pretending to be tree bark and of ineffably elegant caterpillars and dragonflies, or flowers showing off their stamens.His scope widens to lichens, fungi, rock pools and streams (bring your own aquarium and put everything back where you found it). And given his ruthless perfectionism – every hair glistening, every petal immaculate – it is reassuring to be told that smartphone and mobile phone cameras can often yield “acceptable” images.

File photograph: John StillwellPA WireNearly 15,000 people over the age of 75 were forced to wait more than 24 hours to be seen in emergency departments in the first three months of 2018, according to figures released by the Health Service Executive. A total of 14,757 over-75s had to wait that long in Irish hospitals between January and March 2018, a number already significantly above the total 11,261 cases caught in the same situation during the whole of last year. Some 5,493 such patients were left waiting for care for more than a day in hospitals across Ireland in January 2018, while 4,619 had to wait more than 24 hours in February and 4,645 had to wait in March. The highest number of delays was in Dublin’s Mater hospital where some 1,405 people over 75 had to wait more than 24 hours for admission between January and March. The corresponding figures for Galway University Hospital and Tallaght hospital were 1,279 and 984 patients. A letter to Ms Butler from the HSE Acute Hospitals Division admitted that in the first three months of 2018 there had been breaches in the “patient experience time” but that all hospitals “seek to optimise patient flow and minimise wait times for patients”.“The HSE strives to ensure the provision of fair, equitable and timely access to quality, safe health services to all patients attending ED.”Ms Butler described the figures as “shocking and disgraceful” and she stressed that the HSE target was that all attendees aged 75 years or more who attend an emergency department would be discharged or admitted within 24 hours of registration. “Surely to force 14,757 over-75s to wait so long in an emergency department is a form of elder abuse,” said Ms Butler. “It can only be seen as a breach of basic human rights and dignity.”“We need to break this vicious cycle and the recommendations of the bed capacity review must be acted on as a matter of urgency.”Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoDisgraceful\u0026rsquo figures for first three months of the year already above total for 2017Family will have to pay \u0026euro400 in extra accommodation costs due to boat cancellationFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader blames British and Irish governments for Northern Ireland impasseLiga Skromane who was living in Ireland for five years disappeared during trip in KeralaJudge Simon Cowell said \u0026lsquothis is one of my favourite ever auditions\u0026rsquoBallyfermot De La Salle \u0026lsquoin no way associated\u0026rsquo with eventWaterford man Tom Power died while being transferred by ambulance to CorkDespite improvement in public transport councillors voted to suspend car banMan in late 40s arrested after attack at Temple Bar squareIrish activists engage in a \u0026lsquoshop and drop\u0026rsquo to highlight levels of unwanted packagingFormer majority shareholder of INM is all smiles at an event in his honour in Dublin 4GAA figures launched the GAA Athletes for a No Vote campaign in DublinVeteran campaigner compares abortion to the mass slaughter at the SommeIrish Coast Guard unit responds after incident involving woman in her 40sLeo Varadkar hits out at claims by No side in abortion campaign\u0026lsquoShop and drop\u0026rsquo urges people to leave packaging in supermarketsThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3470075.1524398262!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cork car ban was improving journey times before it was scrapped","story":"Traffic restrictions brought in by Cork City Council on March 27th are having a worse economic impact than the World Wars according to city traders. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe car ban on Patrick Street in Cork has been suspended. Photograph: Google Street The ban on cars entering Cork’s main thoroughfare each afternoon was leading to faster travel times on public transport in the city before the measure was scrapped because of pressure from traders. Cork City Council’s unanimous decision to suspend the ban on private cars entering Patrick St each afternoon came despite a report from the council’s own expert on traffic management who revealed the ban was benefiting public transport. Cork City Council Director of Services, Roads and Transportation, Gerry O’Beirne briefed councillors before a vote on Friday night and told them that the ban on private cars entering Patrick St between 3pm and 6.30pm had led to clear improvements in public transport in the city centre.Mr O’Beirne explained that the afternoon private car ban on Patrick St was part of the Cork City Centre Movement Strategy which is designed to address increasing traffic congestion in the city centre and provide for the transport needs of new workers and residents in the city. Cork city has been experiencing ever-increasing traffic congestion and traffic levels have increased significantly in recent years and there are now over 100,000 vehicles per day entering the city centre. Surveys consistently show that two thirds of these do not stop in the city centre, he said.These 66,000 vehicles are using the city centre to travel north and south and this presents a unique opportunity to establish better routing for through traffic to move efficiently and at the same time to free up road space to better support bus service prioritisation, said Mr O’Beirne.Changes by Bus Éireann in ticket pricing with the expansion of the city zone to cover Ballincollig, Carrigaline, Ringskiddy, Glanmire, Carrigtwohill, Blarney and Cork Airport have helped deliver a 23 per cent increase in annual passenger numbers over the three years up to 2017, he said. However traffic volumes are causing significant difficulties with the reliability of bus journey times, he added. Patrick St is critically important to the broader Cork city bus service as approximately 40 per cent of city services use the street each day with the 970 buses movements along Patrick Street having a carry capacity of 60,000 per day and this will a major source of footfall both now and in the future.Bus Éireann revealed that since the introduction of the Patrick St afternoon car ban on March 27th, travel times were cut with an average 20 per cent reduction in travel times in the 208 Route serving Mayfield to Bishopstown and an 18 per cent reduction on 205 Route from Kent Station to CIT.While the afternoon car ban was introduced during the Easter Holidays on March 27th, schools and colleges had since resumed, commencing on April 9th, and “travel movements have been developing as expected without major ongoing difficultiesdelays”, Mr O’Beirne said.Meanwhile early indications regarding the use of the council’s car parking facilities at the Kinsale Road Park \u0026amp Ride, North Main St and Paul St car parks confirm that there was no overall change in customer numbers following the introduction of the private car ban on Patrick St, he added.And since Cork City Council introduced free afternoon Park \u0026amp Ride from Kinsale Road and free two hours parking at Paul St and North Main St, overall parking in the council’s facilities has increased by 9 per cent compared with the same period last year and by 13 per cent within the incentivised period.“Sample journeys taken across the city, pre and post-completion of the total package of traffic measures also suggest that flows are improving, particularly along the quays,” said Mr O’Beirne before the vote, adding the new changes will take a period of time to become fully embedded.“The route from Sarsfield Road roundabout to Tivoli via Wilton Road, Victoria Cross, Dyke Parade, Bacheors Quay and along the quays to Anderson’s Quay and Lower Glanmire Road was recorded as taking 52 minutes in September 2017 compared to 33 minutes this week,” he said.Mr O’Beirne said the reducing traffic congestion and improving travel times was imperative for Cork given that based on current construction activity and recent announcements, the city will see over 5,000 new jobs created in the city centre in the next 36 months.Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3469974.1524329325!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nell mccafferty pro lifers are right about some things","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNell McCafferty has said she is a reluctant supporter of abortion.

The pro-lifers are right. Out come the wee arms and legs, and I thought: ‘Oh God, is this what I am advocating?’”When asked, Ms McCafferty confirmed that she would be voting to repeal the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits abortion, in the forthcoming referendum on the issue.Ms McCafferty was speaking during a discussion entitled: “Celebrating 100 years of the vote for Irish women: Would the Irish suffragettes be happy with the progress to date in securing equality?”The 74-year-old said she was part of the last generation that had mothers who worked full-time in the home. She asked who was now celebrating pregnancy and motherhood.She said couples were out working and were exhausted when they came home, and could not afford the children they had. She said: “Abortion was beyond our consciousness and here we are, 100 years after slaughters like the Somme and places like that, offering abortion on request.”Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum hereThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3470073.1524397494!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"widow calls on government to improve southeast cardiac services","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBernadette Delaney and Thomas Power on their wedding day in September 2016The widow of Waterford farmer Tom Power (40), who died when being transferred by ambulance from University Hospital Waterford to Cork, has urged the Government to improve cardiac services in the southeast.Bernadette Power, who gave birth to the couple’s only child, Tom, in November, six months after the death of her husband, said she never thought when she married her husband in September 2016 that she would be attending his inquest less than two years later.Ms Power sat through some harrowing evidence during the five-hour hearing at Cork City Coroner’s Court when she heard how her late husband had suffered a heart attack between three and seven days before he started complaining of chest pains on their farm in Co Waterford on June 18th, 2017.She listened, surrounded by family and friends, as Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margaret Bolster told how Mr Power died following a rupture to his heart muscle several days after it had been weakened by the heart attack that he either had not noticed or had not reported.Ms Power listened as Dr Ross Murphy, a consultant cardiologist at St Vincent’s who reviewed the case at the request of Cork City coroner Philip Comyn, revealed between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of people who have heart attacks show no symptoms of the event.However, Mr Power’s heart attack weakened the muscle in his heart and left it vulnerable to rupture, and he suffered a huge 3cm rupture that would have necessitated immediate full open-heart surgery if he was to stand any chance of survival, Dr Murphy told the inquest.The inquest heard Mr Power’s condition deteriorated while being transferred by ambulance from University Hospital Waterford (UHW) to Cork University Hospital (CUH) at around 12.45pm on Sunday, June 18th, 2017, because the cath lab in Waterford is only operational between 9am and 5pm from Monday to Friday.Afterward Ms Power issued a statement that was read to the media by her solicitor, Gillian O’Mahony, in which she said she was “now relieved to know what caused my husband Tom’s death after many months of wondering”.She thanked staff at UHW for their treatment of her late husband, and she also thanked them for the way they looked after her through her pregnancy and for the care they gave her son when he was born at the Ardkeen hospital on November 22nd.Ms Power also thanked the staff at CUH for their courtesy and kindness when she arrived there, expecting Tom to follow on only for him to be pronounced dead shortly after arrival on the ambulance transfer from Waterford.“To my family, friends and neighbours, both in Wexford and Waterford, I would like to say thank you for all your help and support you gave me after Tom died and which you continue to give me, The past year has been a very difficult time for me, and your support did not go unnoticed.”She urged the Government to improve cardiac services in the southeast, and although medical experts had ruled out the lack of a second cath lab at UHW being a factor in her husband’s death, Ms Power urged the Government to provide such a facility to provide 247 cardiac cover.Ms Power’s comments regarding cardiac services in the southeast were echoed by Mr Power’s parents, Michael and Eileen, and his sisters, Joan and Catherine, who said their son and brother was disadvantaged by the lack of proper cardiac services in Waterford“He did not have access to a full cardiac centre - give this to the people of the southeast, it’s what they deserve and give it to them now,” said the Power family after the coroner extended his sympathies to them and to Ms Power.Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the Guardian. “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

Last year, just 243 cases were reported.Health officials suspect the rise can be attributed to holidaymnakers returning from the continent. In Europe, there has been a large outbreak in measles this year.Dr Yvonne Doyle, London regional director for Public Health England, said: “We are seeing a concerning increase in measles cases across  London which could lead to a wider outbreak in unvaccinated children and adults.Measles is a highly contagious infectious disease which usually starts with cold-like symptoms“Those who have not received two doses of the vaccine in the past — or who are unsure — should speak to their GP. There’s no harm in receiving an additional dose where there is any uncertainty.“It’s crucial pregnant women have been vaccinated with MMR, as rubella in particular can cause serious complications during pregnancy.”Measles is a highly contagious infectious disease which usually starts with cold-like symptoms, fever and red, sensitive eyes. It can spread very easily and can be caught by breathing in droplets from an infected person when they cough or sneeze.In rare cases, complications can include deafness, blindness and swelling of the brain, leading to brain damage, and in even more rare cases, a progresssive disorder.Please review our commenting policyCyberbullying makes young people twice as likely to self harm or attempt suicide Nigeria\u0026#39s Quranic schools promised shelter for poor children but provide rich pickings for Boko HaramKiller whales \u0026#39put on a show\u0026#39 in River Clyde\u0026#39Nude\u0026#39 gunman kills four in Waffle House shooting in Nashville TennesseeArmenian crisis worsens as opposition leader detained during protestUK weather: Sunday last chance to enjoy heatwave before temperatures plunge and April showers return Earth Day 2018: The shocking facts about the scale of plastic pollution choking our seas Royal baby: Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s due date, possible names and all the latest newsPrince Harry arrives at London Marathon after Queen starts it offPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsDonald Trump considering pardon for boxing legend Jack Johnson after Sylvester Stallone\u0026#39s callWhat it\u0026#39s like to run the London Marathon - carrying a fridge  Lennie James on how the McCanns inspired Save Me and why he was sure that The Walking Dead was going to kill him offWorld\u0026#39s oldest person dies in Japan at age of 117How the UK\u0026#39s special relationship with the US was replaced by Macron\u0026#39s \u0026#39relation spéciale\u0026#39Lord Ashcroft: Why we should salute the Red Baron, the German flying ace who killed 73 British servicemenEarth Day 2018: Why we all need to join the fight to save Britain\u0026#39s beaches from plastic pollutionNicolas Sarkozy among personalities to condemn \u0026#39ethnic-purging\u0026#39 in wave of \u0026#39new anti-Semitism\u0026#39 in FranceDuchess of Cornwall on the joy of being a grandmother: \u0026#39Spoil them and give them back\u0026#39We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"100th anniversary raid zeebrugge pictures","story":"For much of the First World War, the Belgian port of Zeebrugge was used by the Imperial German Navy as a base from which its U-boats were able to attack British maritime targets and light shipping.

Suggestions have included St George\u0027s Day - April 23.With Prince George and Princess Charlotte, Kate gave birth just over five weeks after going on maternity leave. She went on maternity leave for her third child on March 22, so this suggests the baby might put in an appearance around April 27 or 28.Both Prince George, four, and Princess Charlotte, two, are thought to have been born slightly late: in 2015 the Duchess of Cambridge let slip that her due date was towards the end of April, however Princess Charlotte was born on 2 May. This might mean another longer-than-average pregnancy is on the cards for the Duchess.The new arrival will come just weeks before Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tie the knot on May 19, hopefully giving Kate a few days to recover.Prince William and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, hold their new born son GeorgeParking restrictions are in place outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary\u0027s Hospital in London in preparation for the birth.Crowd barriers are set up on the street outside to accommodate the television crews, journalists and photographers who will be present as she goes into labour. Both Prince George and Princess Charlotte were born at the Lindo Wing.The private wing of the NHS hospital charges £5,215 for the first 24 hours if a baby is born naturally, or £6,745 for a Caesarean section, plus £1,155 for the deluxe package for each additional night.Royal baby | Inside the Lindo WingThe \u0027s Anna Maxted had all three of her children there, and describes the rooms as basic, but the care as first-class.When the Duchess of Cambridge was pregnant with Princess Charlotte in 2015, contingency plans were put in place. If the Duchess unexpectedly went into labour while visiting her parents in Bucklebury, she would have been taken to the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, while if she went into labour at Anmer Hall, the couple\u0027s country residence in Norfolk, she would have given birth at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King\u0027s Lynn.The Duke and Duchess have chosen solidly traditional royal names for their children in the past, making it likely they will reference previous monarchs this time as well.Alice, Mary, Alexandra or Victoria for a girl, or Frederick, James, Arthur or Philip for a boy are good bets.There is one former king who\u0027s highly unlikely to ever have another royal namesake: King John. That’s because in his 17-year reign he managed to so sully his name it\u0027s pretty much been removed from royal circulation.Not only was he exceptionally rapacious and cruel (he had a penchant for starving his enemies to death), John was also one of the most cowardly and incompetent scoundrels to sit on the throne.Prince George in JuneThe couple\u0027s first child George will in time become King George VII, following a tradition dating back to German-born George I, the first Hanoverian king of Great Britain who acceded to the throne in 1714. The last was the Queen\u0027s father George VI who died in 1952 but was known to his family as Bertie.Among the previous monarchs to have had the name is George III - on the throne from 1760 to 1820 - who is predominantly remembered for losing the American colonies and his sanity. However, the Prince of Wales has previously disclosed that he is the king he most respects, describing him as a good man who was simply misunderstood.Princess Charlotte in JulyThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge honoured both royal tradition and family ties by naming their second child Charlotte.The name’s royal pedigree includes Queen Charlotte, the wife of George III, who bore him 15 children and helped found Kew Gardens. Queen Charlotte’s \u0026amp Chelsea Hospital, which is named after her, is part of the same NHS Trust as St Mary’s Hospital Paddington, where the private Lindo Wing is situated.Her granddaughter Princess Charlotte of Wales, who married on May 2, the day the new Princess Charlotte was born, died in childbirth in 1817 at the age of just 21. She was the only child of George, Prince of Wales, who would go on to become King George IV.Charlotte also happens to be the middle name of the Duchess’s sister, Pippa Middleton, and goes back in her family to her paternal great-great-great-grandmother Charlotte Ablett, born in 1825 and therefore possibly named for Princess Charlotte.The new royal baby will be fifth in line to the throne, behind the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge, Prince George and Princess Charlotte. It means Prince Harry will drop down to sixth in line, and every other member of the Royal family will be one step further away from the throne.Because of recent changes to the laws governing succession, the baby\u0027s sex will make no difference, as boys no longer have precedence over girls.If the change hadn\u0027t been made and the third baby were a boy, he would be fifth in line instead of Princess Charlotte - however that will now not be the case.The new baby will be an HRH and a Prince or Princess of Cambridge - thanks to the Queen who stepped in ahead of Prince George\u0027s birth to ensure all William\u0027s children had fitting titles.Unlikely. It\u0027s rare, but not unheard of, for a third-born royal in direct succession to become king or queen.This Cambridge sibling will live their life happy in the knowledge they will not be expected to wear the crown, leaving that role to older brother George.William IV, a Hanoverian king who ruled from 1830 to 1837, was a third child - of George III and Queen Charlotte. He acceded to the throne when he outlived his older brothers, George IV, who died without an heir, and Frederick, Duke of York.Both Prince George and Princess Charlotte are believed to have been born by a natural delivery, meaning the Duchess of Cambridge will presumably be planning to have a natural birth this time as well.In 2015 Pat O\u0027Brien, a consultant obstetrician at University College Hospital, said that because of the speed with which the Princess Charlotte was delivered after the Duchess was admitted to hospital, it is likely that she went into labour naturally.From Princess Charlotte to the Queen: The Royal Family as toddlers through the agesHe said: \u0026quotThe fact that she went into hospital at around 6am and had the baby by 8.34am would not imply that she was induced at all.\u0026quotSecond time labours tend to be quicker than first time labours. Everything tends to go faster. The dilation stage is quicker, the pushing stage is usually quicker and easier as well, and the baby comes out more quickly. You would expect it to be an easier labour anyway.\u0026quotThe medical team in charge of safely delivering Princess Charlotte was led by Guy Thorpe-Beeston, Surgeon Gynaecologist to the Royal Household.Mr Thorpe-Beeston, an obstetrician who specialises in high-risk pregnancies, has a private Harley Street practice and is a consultant at the Portland private hospital and at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in the NHS.A Cambridge graduate, he worked at King\u0027s College Hospital in London before becoming a consultant in foetal medicine at Chelsea and Westminster in 1996.The Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s best maternity fashion moments...He was assisted by Alan Farthing, Surgeon Gynaecologist to the Queen, who was the fiance of the television presenter Jill Dando at the time of her murder in 1999, and has been part of the Queen\u0027s medical household since 2008.In 2014 Sir Marcus Setchell, the recently retired surgeon gynaecologist to the Queen who delivered Prince George, told BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour: “What happened in labour is an entirely private matter, but I do think there are certain situations when someone is giving birth that it’s important…to have a specialist…in the same room to deal with anything that’s immediately going to be wrong.”After the Queen, other members of the Royal family and the Middleton family have been told the good news, the royal communications team will email media organisations with the sex, weight and timing of the birth.Moments later the news will be announced via royal Twitter and Instagram accounts before a traditional paper announcement is placed on an easel outside Buckingham Palace.The age-old custom of placing a paper proclamation for the public to see at the Queen\u0027s London residence took place when Prince George and Princess Charlotte were born.A brief formal announcement - on foolscap-sized paper set in a dark wooden frame - will be placed on an ornate golden easel on the forecourt of the Palace.It will confirm the sex of the baby and the time of birth, but will give little else away, other than usually revealing that the baby has been \u0026quotsafely delivered\u0026quot and mother and child are \u0026quotdoing well\u0026quot.It used to be hand-written, but is now typed. It will also be signed at the hospital by the doctors who tended to the duchess, and then ferried back to the Palace by car.Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge was safely delivered of a daughter at 8.34am.\u0026mdash Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) May 2, 2015After the birth of Prince George, the Duchess left hospital the next day, while she left the hospital to go home on the same day after giving birth to Princess Charlotte.But the length of the Duchess\u0027s hospital stay this time around will be entirely down to how she is feeling, so there is no guarantee we will see the baby within 24 hours of its birth. The Duke and Duchess are expected to leave the Lindo Wing by the front door to give the waiting media the chance to take the photographs that will no doubt adorn the front pages of newspapers the next day.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary\u0026#39s Hospital in London in 2015, with Princess CharlotteAfter the birth of Princess Charlotte, the Duke and Duchess spent the first nights of her life at Kensington Palace before driving north to their country home, Anmer Hall, on the Queen\u0027s Sandringham estate, where they were likely joined there by the Duchess\u0027s parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, who often stayed over to help look after Prince George.However, the family permanently relocated to Kensington Palace last year, after deciding Prince George should be schooled in London, so it\u0027s unlikely that they\u0027ll head back to Norfolk for a while.The names given to royal babies are not usually revealed straight away, and the public is often left guessing for several days.William and Kate took two days to announce both George and Charlotte\u0027s names, informing the Queen of their choice beforehand.Mike and Zara Tindall used Twitter to unveil their daughter\u0027s name six days after she was born in 2014, with proud dad Mike tweeting: \u0026quotFor everyone who has asked what our daughter\u0027s name is, it\u0027s Mia Grace Tindall.\u0026quotWhen Princess Beatrice was born in 1988, it was two weeks before her name was known.In 1982, the Prince and Princess of Wales waited seven days before deciding upon and announcing Prince William\u0027s name.The Prince of Wales\u0027s name, however, remained a mystery for an entire month and was only declared ahead of his christening in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace in December 1948.Prince George to start school with mum and dad by his sideThey have on previous occasions: after the birth of Princess Charlotte, the Duke took two weeks\u0027 statutory paternity leave from his job as an air ambulance pilot, which he quit in July 2017 to become a full time royal, and the Duchess took maternity leave from her official royal duties.After the birth of Prince George, the Duchess was back in action after five weeks, joining her husband to start the Anglesey Coastal Ultra Marathon. However, she maintained a light workload for several months after both births.As well as having a full-time nanny and plenty of help from the Middletons in 2015, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge hired another temporary nanny to help them through the first weeks of Princess Charlotte\u0027s life.The couple were determined to manage without professional help when Prince George was born, but he was not a good sleeper and the Duchess became exhausted after countless sleepless nights.Prince George, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince George\u0026#39s nanny, Maria BorralloThey eventually accepted they needed help, and hired Spaniard Maria Borrallo from the world-famous Norland nanny agency when Prince George was seven months old.When Princess Charlotte was born they reportedly made arrangements through Norland for a maternity nurse to work full-time for at least three months, to get them through the most difficult period of their new baby’s life.The Duchess of Cambridges best jewellery momentsAlmost certainly. Perhaps the most tasteful souvenir will be a commemorative £5 coin that is likely to be a hit with collectors.When Prince George was born the Royal Mint produced 10,000 solid silver coins, which cost £80 each, and 2,013 22 carat gold sovereigns, priced at £800.

Tomorrow a lot of people, especially in the South East, will feel a drop in temperature.“So in Norwich we could see a high of 24C today and we are forecasting a high of 15C tomorrow.“The temperature is going to come down to where it should be for this time of year and the weather after that will be changeable. ”Conditions on Monday will largely be dry and bright in the south, but significantly cooler. The North will be cloudy tomorrow with scattered showers and more persistent rain later in the day.Tuesday onward will see more widespread rain across the country with the cooler conditions expected to last through the rest of the month.Please review our commenting policyCyberbullying makes young people twice as likely to self harm or attempt suicide Nigeria\u0026#39s Quranic schools promised shelter for poor children but provide rich pickings for Boko HaramKiller whales \u0026#39put on a show\u0026#39 in River Clyde\u0026#39Nude\u0026#39 gunman kills four in Waffle House shooting in Nashville TennesseeArmenian crisis worsens as opposition leader detained during protestEarth Day 2018: The shocking facts about the scale of plastic pollution choking our seas Royal baby: Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s due date, possible names and all the latest newsPrince Harry arrives at London Marathon after Queen starts it offPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsDonald Trump considering pardon for boxing legend Jack Johnson after Sylvester Stallone\u0026#39s callWhat it\u0026#39s like to run the London Marathon - carrying a fridge  Lennie James on how the McCanns inspired Save Me and why he was sure that The Walking Dead was going to kill him offWorld\u0026#39s oldest person dies in Japan at age of 117How the UK\u0026#39s special relationship with the US was replaced by Macron\u0026#39s \u0026#39relation spéciale\u0026#39Lord Ashcroft: Why we should salute the Red Baron, the German flying ace who killed 73 British servicemenEarth Day 2018: Why we all need to join the fight to save Britain\u0026#39s beaches from plastic pollutionNicolas Sarkozy among personalities to condemn \u0026#39ethnic-purging\u0026#39 in wave of \u0026#39new anti-Semitism\u0026#39 in FranceDuchess of Cornwall on the joy of being a grandmother: \u0026#39Spoil them and give them back\u0026#39Facebook given week to protect children as Jeremy Hunt accuses social media firms of \u0026#39turning blind eye\u0026#39We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/21/TELEMMGLPICT000130102842_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwaW2YSoQ2mJ8-KFEoQaDL4Y.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"uks special relationship us replaced macrons relation speciale","story":"Those close to the world leaders believe that Emmanuel Macron has more sway with Donald Trump than Theresa MayOn Monday night Emmanuel Macron will sit down to a sumptuous dinner at the Mount Vernon estate, the private home of George Washington, the first president of the United States.His host, the current incumbent Donald Trump, will be in full flattery mode, showering praise on his \u0026quotbest friend Emmanuel\u0026quot. The following day Mr Macron will have the rare honour of addressing a joint session of Congress.

This would be followed by canonisation, when a person officially becomes a saint.The process would be initiated by Robert C. Ndlovu, the Archbishop of Harare, the diocese in which Bradburne died, petitioning the Holy See. Bishop Ndlovu is understood to be supportive of the campaign.A Vatican-appointed \u0026quotpostulator\u0026quot would then investigate Bradburne\u0027s life story in order to gather evidence about his deeds and build the case for his sainthood.The campaign follows the beatification of Cardinal Henry Newman by Pope Benedict XVI in September 2010, during his visit to the United Kingdom.Newman’s canonisation is dependent on the documentation of additional miracles attributed to the cardinal, who died in 1890.In 1970 Pope Paul VI canonised forty English and Welsh Catholic martyrs who were executed between 1535 and 1679.Leading the campaign to beatify Bradburne is his niece Celia Brigstocke, 63, the secretary of the John Bradburne Memorial Society, founded in 1995 to fund the leprosy centre where he worked.She said: \u0026quotPeople relate to John - they like the story, it\u0027s both sad, and also a very rewarding story.\u0026quotI think it\u0027s an inspiration to people.\u0026quotFrank Cottrell Boyce, the novelist and screenwriter who wrote the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony and who is a lifelong Catholic, has donated £400 to support the effort.He told the Sunday  that he was inspired by Bradburne\u0027s story after meeting a former soldier who had served with him during the Second World War, at church in his home parish in Liverpool.\u0026quotHe hasn\u0027t tried to cure his weakness, he\u0027s taken it out there and given it to people. It\u0027s really beautiful,\u0026quot he said. \u0026quotThere\u0027s no big machine behind him - he\u0027s just a secular person, he\u0027s not a member of a religious order, he\u0027s not a priest as such, he\u0027s just a guy trying to live a good life. For logistical reasons those people are underrepresented in the canon as saints.\u0026quotProfessor David Crystal, a linguistics expert who has compiled and published many of Bradburne\u0027s 6,000 poems, has donated £250 to the cause.He said efforts to beatify Bradburne had been held up by the fact that his canonisation would make Zimbabwe\u0027s first saint a white man.\u0026quotIt is a sensitive issue out there. So it took a while for the groundswell of support for Bradburne to convince everybody that even though he was white, who cares - he was looking out for the lepers,\u0026quot he said.A spokesman for the Archbishop of Harare said he was out of office and therefore unable to comment.Vatican City and Holy SeePlease review our commenting policyAndrea Nahles wins SPD leader contest but could be a tricky ally for embattled Angela MerkelCyberbullying makes young people twice as likely to self harm or attempt suicide Nigeria\u0026#39s Quranic schools promised shelter for poor children but provide rich pickings for Boko HaramKiller whales \u0026#39put on a show\u0026#39 in River Clyde\u0026#39Nude\u0026#39 gunman kills four in Waffle House shooting in Nashville TennesseeArmenian crisis worsens as opposition leader detained during protestUK weather: Sunday last chance to enjoy heatwave before temperatures plunge and April showers return Earth Day 2018: The shocking facts about the scale of plastic pollution choking our seas Royal baby: Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s due date, possible names and all the latest newsPrince Harry arrives at London Marathon after Queen starts it offPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsDonald Trump considering pardon for boxing legend Jack Johnson after Sylvester Stallone\u0026#39s callWhat it\u0026#39s like to run the London Marathon - carrying a fridge  Lennie James on how the McCanns inspired Save Me and why he was sure that The Walking Dead was going to kill him offWorld\u0026#39s oldest person dies in Japan at age of 117How the UK\u0026#39s special relationship with the US was replaced by Macron\u0026#39s \u0026#39relation spéciale\u0026#39Lord Ashcroft: Why we should salute the Red Baron, the German flying ace who killed 73 British servicemenEarth Day 2018: Why we all need to join the fight to save Britain\u0026#39s beaches from plastic pollutionNicolas Sarkozy among personalities to condemn \u0026#39ethnic-purging\u0026#39 in wave of \u0026#39new anti-Semitism\u0026#39 in FranceWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/21/TELEMMGLPICT000160987283_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq2cL0sTuDPsgaMieaY8Gb6YqX9m0grXVtT35E0WiG8vE.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"vatican urged declare british missionary john bradburnea catholic","story":"The Vatican is being urged to declare a British missionary a Catholic saint following reports that he miraculously cured a man of his brain tumor and that blood was inexplicably seen dripping from his coffin.Supporters of John Bradburne are trying to raise £20,000 to fund efforts to beatify the missionary and poet, who died in Zimbabwe in 1979.They say the formal process is about to begin and funds must be raised so a Vatican-appointed investigator can verify details of Bradburne\u0027s life and works, including miracles attributed to him.Bradburne, the son of an Anglican rector who was born in Skirwith, Cumbria, became a Roman Catholic in 1947 after fighting in the Second World WarAfter wandering through Europe and the Middle East he became the warden of a leper colony in Mutemwa, Zimbabwe.But at the age of 58, in the last months of the country’s war of liberation against white minority rule he was killed by guerillas when he refused to leave the colony to save himself.Attendees at his requiem mass reported seeing drops of blood below his coffin, but when it was opened no blood was found inside the casket.Several other miracles have been attributed to Bradburne since his death, including the case of a man in Scotland who supporters claim was cured of a brain tumour after praying to him a decade ago.Over the years annual gatherings in Mutemwa to mark the anniversary of Bradburne’s death have attracted tens of thousands of pilgrims.But to become a saint he would first have to be beatified by the church and this can only take place once the existence of a miracle has been established.

They appear to have an easy rapport with the public, with their shareholders, with the business media, with politicians and with regulators. When things sometimes go wrong, as they inevitably do, they can easily be forgiven. For others, by contrast, an error is widely regarded as another negative, sometimes fatally so.For the first group, they can turn even the very worst into good, not cynically and exploitatively, but naturally. For the latter, it may prove to be the final blow, for the senior management or the brand, or both – the executives destined never to recover their personal reputations.London falls out of top 10 most expensive business travel destinationsWhat’s the most traumatic event to befall an organisation? One that ranks highly or the highest, is a death or deaths or serious injury as a result of something they did not do or due to a design fault they did not correct. For the bosses, a tragedy occurring on their watch is a nightmare. How they respond can determine whether they still have a future or if their careers are over.I’ve now been through several of these product safety occurrences, with different companies, products, markets and countries. Each time, I sit and listen as a tale of disaster unfolds. Often the boss will raise doubts and inject arguments clearly prepared for them by a lawyer. Sometimes, in relation to their subsequent portrayal by the press and on social media, possibly to make them feel better, they will allege the existence of a conspiracy, out to pounce on any mistake.Frequently, their legal adviser will have instructed them to say little, to not do anything that may suggest an acceptance of liability.But there is other advice that is just as crucial. I studied law at university. I know how lawyers think and behave, how they’re taught to avoid saying anything categoric, how they must qualify everything.On my first national newspaper, The Sunday Times, one of the editorial chiefs called me into his office. “You did law, didn’t you?” he said. I nodded. “What’s this,” he asked, pointing to a table.“It’s a table,” I said. “Well, bloody well say so. Don’t say ‘it’s got a flat top and four legs and therefore it could be a table’. It’s a table.”Increasingly, I’m recommending to business leaders, masters of the universe, powerful people who have been hugely successful in their chosen spheres, but are now mired in adversity, a simple truth: be human. Show the world you’re a human being, that you have feelings too, that you care and you do empathise.If it looks as though someone died or suffered terrible harm because they used one of your products or one of your staff made a calamitous mistake, whatever the reason – and don’t hold out for 100 per cent proof – see them if they’re still alive, visit the relatives.

But it’s not about admitting culpability or blame, and there and then capitulating on a damages bill, as the legal eagles would have you believe. The charge has been made, however incorrectly, that your firm, your product, your name, was somehow involved. Step up, and show them and the world you share their pain. Sorting out the finer points of a lawsuit is for another day. For now, this is about displaying that behind that faceless exterior, a heart beats.It’s the most natural reaction to succumb to the lawyer’s entreaties, and to retreat behind the grand edifice. You can cite all manner of reasons for doing so – that it’s got nothing to do with you, that your involvement is not certain, that it sets an awful precedent for future crises, that you’ve nothing to be ashamed of.All of which may be true. But none of them deal with the reality, an increasing one in today’s world of snap, digital, viral judgment, that businesses must act as if they were human.And not just where there’s been a death or injury. In their treatment of anything that may see them being questioned, their every move dissected and judged, companies must reveal a sure, warm, personal touch. That means not falling back on spin that points to a greater success (“we sell X million units every year and this was the only one to go wrong”), to stellar numbers and profits (similarly of no consequence to those who have suffered, something did go wrong and right now, that is all that matters).None of this is simple, and each case is different. There are always variants, a particular set of circumstances, another twist or detail. Neither should it form part of a textbook creed, a subject to be absorbed at business school. No amount of written-down, ordered, robotic procedure can suffice.It’s about doing what is right, and doing it well – and holding a mirror up to yourself. It’s incredible how many supposedly sophisticated, well-versed in selling themselves iniduals and corporations fail to do this. They cannot see what others see, how they’re seen.

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy.

Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough.

It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.Email cannot be used.

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ Email cannot be used.

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”Email cannot be used.

Unfortunately, there was not nearly enough supply for the legions of fans who arrived at restaurants, police being called to some as outrage spread.Speaking to Vulture about the whole fiasco, co-creator Dan Harmon spoke about not receiving any notice from McDonald’s about the promotion and the show’s fans.TV preview 2018: Everything to look out forTV preview 2018: Everything to look out forStart date: 23 April, AMC on BT TV“It’s weird to get mugged by McDonald’s. It’s kind of an honour,” he told the publication of McDonald’s lack of communication with the Rick and Morty team.Commenting on the fan response, Harmon said: “I wouldn’t wish that show’s fans on any fast-food restaurant. I think everybody got what they deserved all around.”McDonald’s later apologised to fans for not producing enough sauce, releasing a further 20 million packets, as well as a podcast named The Sauce.

One of the people Dr Ilardo met told her he once stayed underwater for 13 minutes while hunting.Bajau \u0027sea nomads\u0027 of IndonesiaBajau \u0027sea nomads\u0027 of IndonesiaThe Bajau village of Jaya BaktiJaya Bakti homes from the waterA Bajau villager demonstrates the use of traditional wooden gogglesA young Bajau girl looks on in excitement as her father, a traditional Bajau er, returns to Jaya Bakti from a two-week fishing tripA small, unnamed island serves as a haven for visiting Bajau houseboats.\u0026#13The population was interested in learning about their genetic heritage, and Dr Ilardo used a portable ultrasound machine to measure spleen size in 59 Bajau.She then measured spleen size in 34 people from a neighbouring village inhabited by non- Bajau people so she could make a comparison.When she took her data back to Denmark to analyse, Dr Ilardo found Bajau people had spleens around 50 per cent larger than their neighbours. Spleens are involved in the so-called “human e response”. When a body is submerged in cold water the heart rate slows, blood vessels in the extremities shrink and the spleen contracts.This contraction injects a spurt of additional oxygen-rich blood cells into circulation, allowing the body to survive for longer underwater. Dr Ilardo and her collaborators estimated the enlarged spleens of the Bajau could provide them with around 10 per cent more blood cells than someone with a normal-sized spleen.Humans ‘evolving gene’ that may stop us drinking alcoholAs well as measuring spleen size, Dr Ilardo took spit samples from the study participants so she could investigate the genetic basis for the differences she was seeing. She identified several genes that were observed far more frequently in the genomes of Bajau participants, including one – PDE10A – that is involved with the production of thyroid hormone, which in turn is associated with spleen size.We believe that in the Bajau they have an adaptation that increases thyroid hormone levels and therefore increases their spleen size, said Dr Ilardo. It\u0027s been shown in mice that thyroid hormones and spleen size are connected. “If you genetically alter mice to have an absence of the thyroid hormone T4, their spleen size is drastically reduced, but this effect is actually reversible with an injection of T4.\u0027Unprecedented\u0027 7,000-year-old Native American burial site discovered by amateur er off coast off FloridaThis is the first adaptation for ing ever observed in humans. Previous work appeared to show that sea nomad children had superior underwater eyesight, but those results have since been disproved.The findings were published in the journal Cell. Despite initially warning Dr Ilardo against undertaking the work due to the likelihood she would find no significant results, her supervisors Professor Eske Willerslev and Professor Rasmus Nielsen think her findings are significant for a number of reasons.This is the first time that we really have a system like that in humans to study, said Dr Nielsen. “Nature has made experiments for us that tell us how humans react and adapt genetically to a whole new set of physiological conditions, so that we can explore and learn much more about the interaction between genetics and physiology.Mutant gene in Amish makes them live 10 years longerUnderstanding the genetics underpinning the Bajau’s abilities could even have applications in medical research – specifically for those trying to treat the condition of acute hypoxia, when body tissue experiences a rapid depletion of oxygen.There is also a fundamental need to understand the ersity of genes found in the world’s indigenous populations, said Professor Willerslev.This really tells us how valuable and important indigenous populations are around the world that are living extreme lifestyles, in terms of understanding the function of various genetic traits and finding the underlying genetic background for various physiological traits, he said. Most of these populations are completely understudied, and I think there is a huge benefit, not only potentially to them, but also to the rest of mankind by actually paying some attention to them.Email cannot be used.

Over the next 12 hours, she and her mother Florence were strapped in waist restraint belts, placed in two separate vans and – chaperoned by a dozen officers – driven to Heathrow to be forcibly removed from Britain– the country Opelo has lived in since the age of 13.“I went down to reception and she sat me in a little room,” the 27-year-old told The Independent. “Then another manager came in and she put on a pair of latex gloves. As soon as she came in with those on I knew what was happening.Woman brought to UK from Botswana as a child in deportation reprieveYarl\u0027s Wood: Inside the crisis-hit immigration detention centreThe attempt to deport Opelo Kgari shows how unjust our system isGovernment thwarted in new bid to deport woman brought to UK as child“I couldn’t believe my unit manager had brought me there under false pretences. Just a few days ago we had sat together and talked about how we could improve the unit, and she was saying she’d do everything she can to make things better. “And then a few days later she’s been really sly and brought me into the situation the way she did. I felt so betrayed and angry.”Opelo was searched and told she could make one phone call before she had to hand over her mobile phone. With fight still in her at this point, she refused, arguing that as she was still in the centre she still had the right to have her possessions. But when she saw her mum brought through the door, she realised she had to make that phone call as soon as possible.“I realised at that point that it’s absolutely pointless trying to argue with these people, and that the sooner I call my solicitor the better. I was only allowed to phone one number, so he was the only person I could call,” she says. “I tried to argue the fact that my case is far bigger than just my solicitor. There are so many other people involved who can help me. But they said my solicitor was the only person who could help me. And that was the last time I could call anyone.”Opelo informed their solicitor as to what was happening. Shortly after the phone call, the “removal team” arrived: a group of 12 officers employed by Tascor, a Capita-owned company contracted by the Home Office to escort detainees to charter flights. Opelo found herself being searched again, this time more stringently.“We had our shoes taken off and we were searched right down to our socks,” she said, her voice breaks. She pauses as she tries to hold back the tears. “I find I can deal with a lot of it as best I can, but when I get searched – especially in the way that they did – it makes me feel so so small, and almost like a criminal, like I’ve done something really wrong. “I broke down when she was searching me. She stripped me of the last bit of dignity that I thought I had.”As this was happening, Opelo saw that their possessions were being loaded into the vans: “Officers had gone into our rooms and started chucking all our clothes and belongings into laundry bags. I recognised my gym bag and realised it was all of our stuff. It’s really hard to deal with and figure out how best to cope with it except just go with it until it’s over.”Government thwarted in new bid to deport woman brought to UK as childAs she was wearing just a pair of leggings and a top, Opelo was told she could change into jeans, but two officers were required to go into the toilet with her. They turned their backs to her, but she wasn’t allowed to close the door.Opelo and her mother were then “bound” in restraint belts, which Tascor has the right to use following an “inidual risk assessment”. Official Home Office guidelines state: “It may be decided that the use of a waist restraint belt provides the most effective method of managing a safe escort”.Despite not trying to physically resist the removal, the women were placed in the “restricted” restraint belt, which meant their wrists were strapped to the waist belt, limiting their arm movement.“They’re made of seatbelt material, but much thicker,” Opelo recalls. “They put it around you and on your wrists, so you can’t really move, you’re literally bound. I couldn’t move my arms more than 30cm from my body. And it has handles on either side on your ribs so that the officers can physically move you if say you didn’t want to walk. So they can pull you along.”At this stage, Opelo breaks down in tears.“I was already stripped of all dignity, so you just kind of go with it. But you just feel… like you’re not even a person anymore. They don’t even treat you like a person, it’s like you don’t matter to anyone. And the whole time my mum was saying that’s my baby, don’t treat her like that.”She and Florence were led into two separate vans, accompanied by six officers in each. As far as Opelo knew, the next time she would see her mum could be on a flight bound for a country she hardly remembers, away from everything she knows.Women in Yarl\u0027s Wood go on hunger strike over \u0027inhumane\u0027 conditionsOpelo – who throughout her time at Yarl’s Wood has tried to maintain a friendly rapport with the officers there, blaming the Home Office for her situation rather than them – is sympathetic towards the staff removing her, explaining that they “tried” to have conversations with her in the van.“They really did try, but I had mentally shut down by this point” she says. “Bless the woman sat next to me. She was so, so lovely. But I just couldn’t find it in myself to try. I think a lot of it stemmed from the way we were treated while we were still in Yarl’s Wood and handed over to them.”The vans arrived to the outskirts of London ahead of schedule, six hours before the flight was due to leave, so the removal team decided to park outside one of Tascor’s offices situated close to Heathrow until the time was more appropriate to go to the airport.“They parked the vans across from each other so they could all come out and talk to each other, but they had to remain in the van,” Opelo remembers. “We were there for a few hours just waiting. I had to stay in the van, separate from my mum.”Throughout the process, Opelo and Florence’s solicitors had been desperately trying to get an injunction from the courts to halt the removal. Three hours before the flight, Florence received a call saying they had succeeded. They would not be removed that day.“It was really good news, but they said that until the Home Office confirms they had to continue with the operation and take them onto security. Even though the judge had made a decision, they still had to wait on the Home Office,” says Opelo.“But it felt like a massive cloud had just shifted, the mood shifted, the officers relaxed a little bit. They said it was such good news they took the belt off me. They were really pleased that we didn’t have to go through with it.”Yarl\u0027s Wood: Inside the crisis-hit immigration detention centreAn hour later, the officers got confirmation of the injunction from the Home Office, and set off back to Yarl’s Wood, the women still in different vans. Due to bad traffic, they didn’t get back until around 10pm, and  then had to wait in reception for two hours.“We had literally left earlier in the day so I thought they should still have everything in place. But we sat and sat and sat. They had a TV so I put Made in Chelsea on – the most mindless show. I watched that and two other shows. Three other people coming in that night. After two and a half hours we got to go to our rooms,” says Opelo.“They had to search everything again. The whole process took another 40 minutes again. So we didn’t get back into our rooms until about 1am. I imagine a lot of money was wasted.”Since The Independent previously spoke to Opelo in February, at which point she had been in Yarl’s Wood for five weeks, there is a notable change in her demeanour. She maintains her ease of communication and is even able to laugh at times, but following the deportation attempt – the second she has been subjected to within a matter of weeks – the optimism and energy she had before has petered away.  “It’s because I don’t have much to smile about. It’s really difficult now to find something to smile about. You have to find joy somewhere, but the situation just gets harder and harder. I sometimes feel like I can’t carry on.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesTeam England Athletes during the Commonwealth Games Team England Parade in Victoria Square, Birmingham.Varun Chopra of Essex during the Specsavers County Championship Division One match between Essex and Lancashire at the Chelmsford County Cricket Ground.

The widespread public backing for her to remain in Britain is a source of hope, but regardless of her fate, what she has been through is likely to stay with her for years to come.“I’m trying to keep it together. I’ve decided not to see the psychiatrist in the centre because there’s only one and other people in here who need it much more than me, she says. “But I\u0027m pretty certain that when I come out I\u0027ll need to see a well-trained professional to go over the last few months of what I’ve been through. It’s extremely naïve to think it won’t affect me.“Being here is just mental torture, and the Home Office does this so they can tire you out and wear you out. It’s not okay to put people through this. No one should ever have to go through anything in this proximity.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “Earlier this month, the court issued an injunction against the removal of Florence and Opelo Kgari although their immigration status remains unchanged. We have noted the injunction and are carefully considering its implications.”They said that they monitor the use of restraint by custody officers closely to ensure that the use of restraint is reasonable, necessary and proportionate, and operate a comprehensive complaints system if detainees feel that they have not been treated in accordance with Home Office standards.Asylum and ImmigrationEmail cannot be used.

In essence, there is a concern that some voters will be disenfranchised as a result of restrictive identification requirements,” writes Claire Collier, the commission\u0027s legal secretary.The intervention comes after a slew of stories this week about members of the Windrush generation facing problems with access to healthcare and other state services.Many immigrants who arrived from the Caribbean between the late Forties and Seventies have no record of their legal status.Responding to the letter, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the newspaper: “It is the same hostile environment all over again, shutting our fellow citizens out of public life, treating communities who made Britain their home as second-class citizens. It’s disgraceful and it must be brought to an end.”The new electoral rules are set to be tried for the first time in five local authority areas – Bromley, Gosport, Swindon, Watford and Woking – during this year’s local elections on 3 May. If a success, they will be rolled out nationally from 2020.Although they are being implemented in response to perceived increase in voter identity fraud, figures previously reported by The Independent suggest the risk of such crime is minimal.A study by the Electoral Commission found just 28 allegations of someone having lied about their identity at a polling station in 2017, despite almost 45 million votes having been cast.Only one of these allegations resulted in a conviction.

Argue with Nigel FarageBrexit: Tory and Labour MPs team up to push through customs union voteUK wants the EU to protect its products from imitation after Brexit“The sector would undeniably suffer from reverting to WTO tariffs in the event of a ‘no deal’ scenario,” the MPs’ report states.The committee added British participation in the single market and customs union had led to an “over reliance” on EU markets, which accounted for 60 per cent of the £22bn in processed food and drinks exports in 2017.They said during their inquiry the committee did not hear any evidence that moving away from the current customs arrangements could be beneficial to UK manufacturers or consumers.May’s Brexit orce bill ‘could cost billions more than estimated’It echoes a similar warning from Sainsbury’s chief executive Mike Coupe, who last month said the supermarket would have to increase prices if any barriers to imports were introduced after Brexit.Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said: “The success of the industry has been highly dependent on participating in the single market and customs union.“To ensure the continued success of our food and drinks industry, the government must provide clarity and certainty on our future relationship with the EU and seek continued regulatory, standards and trading alignment with the EU in the processed food and drink sector.”The report added that the industry, which employs 400,000 people – a third of them EU nationals – would “undeniably suffer” if Britain left without a trade deal and was forced to fall back on WTO rules.Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?\u0026#13Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026#13Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.\u0026#13The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.\u0026#13Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.\u0026#13The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.\u0026#13Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13“The EU’s most favoured nation tariffs under WTO rules would be disastrous for UK exports and must be avoided at all cost,” the committee said.“A no deal scenario would be unviable and unacceptable to the sector as, at least in the short term, the EU is the UK’s main trading partner. It would also have serious repercussions for importers of UK products in the EU and the rest of the world.”The committee warned that if the UK tried to lower or remove tariffs on imports after Brexit, the consequences for British farming could be “extremely serious” while the impact on prices in the shops was likely to be “very limited”.It said that Britain should remain “as close as possible” to EU regulations, warning that UK consumers “would not tolerate any lowering of standards”. It also urged the government to seek a deal on immigration to allow the industry continued access to EU labour – both skilled and unskilled – on which it is heavily reliant.Email cannot be used.

Parliament can, if it chooses, let the people have their say on the deal, and with public support for a People’s Vote growing by the day, that’s exactly what parliament should do.”Caroline Lucas, the co-leader of the Green Party and a backer of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain campaign, said that “many MPs from across the political ide” would wish to amend the motion.“It’s now down to parliament to flex its muscles on this issue, and give people a say on this monumentally important decision,” she said.Mr Baker’s admission came in evidence to a Lords committee investigating the nature of the so-called “meaningful vote” on the final deal, which will take place later this year, or early in 2019.The prime minister, and other ministers, have repeatedly insisted that while MPs can reject the agreement reached with the EU, that would simply mean the UK crashing out with no deal at all.Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union.

The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13But Mr Baker, when asked if the motion “would be amendable”, told peers: “I believe the position is that parliament can always seek to amend motions.”The minister was then asked specifically what would happen if an amendment requiring a fresh referendum was carried, replying: “That would be an extremely controversial situation, of course.”Mr Baker acknowledged such an amendment could not be ignored, adding: “We would be in the position where we would have to look extremely carefully at what the amendment precisely was.”And he held open the possibility of attempts to change the nature of the deal – which, if successful, would send the prime minister back to the negotiating table, it has been argued.“Clearly, the range of amendments that is possible is within the bounds of the imagination of all members of parliament,” the minister said.Speaking to the Lords constitution committee on Wednesday, Mr Baker suggested parliament had a duty to respect the referendum result and not to “frustrate that process”.UK wants the EU to protect its products from imitation after BrexitWindrush wasn’t an anomaly – and it has implications for BrexitLiam Fox ‘underestimating’ difficulty of getting farming trade deals“We will leave, there will not be attempts to stay in by the back door, there will not be an attempt to reverse the result,” he insisted – but he admitted it was “a political point, rather than a constitutional point”.Ms May has firmly rejected a further referendum, but some pro-EU Tories believe she could yet accept one if it appears the only way to keep her warring party together on Europe.Similarly, although Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour does not back another referendum, he has left the door open to a change of mind.There is also evidence that support is growing for a referendum on the Brexit deal, amid continuing confusion about both the planned transition period and the final agreement with the EU.A recent poll for Best for Britain found that 44 per cent of people want a vote – a clear eight points ahead of the 36 per cent who reject a further referendum.Opinion appears to be shifting as the negotiations remain bogged down on how to avoid a hard border in Ireland and with the details of a future trade deal unlikely to even be discussed until after departure day.Strikingly, last month David Davis predicted that parliament would vote down the deal unless the trade terms were broadly agreed – but the EU has insisted there is no time before its autumn deadline.The constitution committee was told the vote would take place “as soon as possible” after an expected autumn agreement in Brussels, and that it should be supported “in the national interest”.If parliament backs that motion, it will be followed by a Withdrawal Agreement and Implementation Bill (Waib) to put the agreement into legal effect.Some MPs believe the “meaningful vote”, secured in a revolt last December, should take place on the bill, rather than the motion, only then passing the regulations necessary to deliver Brexit.Email cannot be used.

He said his act was inspired by a discussion he had at a conference that raised the issue of lower caste communities being denied entry to temples. He said he told students about a well-known legend in which a priest carried a Dalit devotee into a temple. When they expressed scepticism that a Hindu priest would do such a thing, he decided to do it himself.Inside Story - How to address Dalits plight?There is a lot of discrimination against Dalits but this stems from society, not from religious scriptures, Mr Aditya told the BBC. I hope others do the same - it doesn\u0027t mean everyone should literally carry a Dalit man on their shoulders. But they must welcome Dalits into temples and to participate in rituals, he added.Mr Rangarajan said other priests told him they would now do the same in their own temples . World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSouth Koreans cheer during the welcoming event for the inter-Korean summit between South Korea and North Korea in Seoul.

Some consumers wondered whether the French meat industry was feeling threatened by the rise in popularity of vegan food others doubted that consumers would ever be confused.One said: This is ridiculous. I can tell you now no carnivore has ever bought veggie sausages or Quorn thinking they were buying meat.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSouth Koreans cheer during the welcoming event for the inter-Korean summit between South Korea and North Korea in Seoul.

The Kremlin isn\u0027t ready to do it just yet - but that doesn\u0027t mean they won\u0027t break the\u0026nbspinternet\u0026nbsptryingOn Friday 13 April, inside a cramped Moscow courtroom, Judge Yulia Smolina made Russian internet history. It took her just 19 minutes to agree to a government request to block the popular messaging app Telegram. The brutal efficiency of the decision — which took hold even before an appeal took place — suggested everyone thought implementation would be easy. Communications regulator Roskomndazor began implementing the ban last Monday, ordering internet providers to block access to the messaging app. A game of hide and seek ensued. As soon as the first subnets were blocked, Telegram switched to its servers to alternate IP addresses. Regulators responded by blocking entire internet subsets — to general calamity. By midday on 19 April, it had banned a total of 18 million IP addresses (compare this to 38,000 in all previous years.)Importing apple trees instead of apples, Russia secures foodMany businesses, including parts of the banking infrastructure, were caught in Roskomndazor\u0027s net. On Sunday, Gmail and some other Google services went offline for many Russians, as the authorities shut down major networks they believed were being used to circumvent the ban.Telegram, meanwhile, remained accessible to the vast majority of Russian users. The Kremlin faced an embarrassing reality that the internet proved stronger than its heaviest fist. But for many, the fear is that sharper impacts will now follow. Once a largely free space, the Russian internet has been increasingly subjected to regulation and censorship. The first blocklists appeared in 2012. Now, the decision of a remote Siberian village court is enough for a site to be struck off completely. Such, for example, was the fate that this year befell the country’s leading LGBT website, gay.ru — and any number of dating and porn sites the year before. Russia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsKremlin threatens to expel all UK media if Britain shuts down RTRepublicans say they found \u0027no evidence\u0027 Trump conspired with RussiaInstragram \u0027removed photos of Kremin leader with escorts aboard yacht\u0027In 2015, a new law was passed forcing foreign tech companies to move Russian data to servers inside Russia. Most refused to comply, but that may change. Kremlin hardliners have meanwhile made little secret of ongoing work to build an analogue to the Great Chinese Firewall. The Chinese model is now one of three scenarios under consideration, says the independent observer Konstantin Gaaze. The first is to continue as if nothing has happened. Russia could certainly continue its haphazard approach of blocking subsets and IP addresses. But if it is to appear remotely effective, it will need the agreement of Apple and Google — for example, to block the notifications the app is using to update users on new server addresses. In 2016, the tech giants did co-operate with the Kremlin to remove the much less popular LinkedIn platform from its stores, but it is unclear if they will do so in these more controversial circumstances. On the other hand, Russia could choose to revisit and fudge the original court decision. Or it could take a sledgehammer to the internet with a system of filters and whitelists. “The Security Council met on Thursday, and it appears no major decision has been taken,” Mr Gaaze told The Independent. “Things are likely to continue as they are until the inauguration in May — then it is anyone’s guess”Others are less sure that Russia can make a firewall work. “It isn’t workable right now, as we don’t have the technology to deal with the data involved,” says Andrei Soldatov, author of The Red Web. China has been ready lend a hand to the Kremlin, the security expert told The Independent, but the “paranoia” of Russia’s security services has prevailed.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSouth Koreans cheer during the welcoming event for the inter-Korean summit between South Korea and North Korea in Seoul.
