Once a would-be model with high cheekbones and pouty lips, Magnotta had become obsessed with Hollywood, dedicating his life to pursuing stardom.Failing to find success in the fashion world, he became a stripper, appeared in gay porn videos and posted thousands of clearly photoshopped images of himself leading a jet-set lifestyle in glamorous locations around the world.Hungry for fame, Magnotta had set up at least 70 Facebook pages and 20 websites under different names, which he used to plant rumours about himself, including that he was in a relationship with a high-profile convicted murderer.But as the Facebook investigators closed in on their target, something else was starting to happen: Magnotta seemed to be feeding off the notoriety he was gaining. And as the focus upon him intensified, so his actions grew more extreme.Indeed, his next move was to release two further videos of him killing kittens – one fed to a python and the other drowned in a bath while tied to the end of a pole.Then, revelling in the attention, Magnotta apparently confirmed to those hunting him that he was indeed the killer. Now Deanna feared that he might pose a threat to people, too.It is well known that some psychopaths kill animals before moving on to murder people, and in Deanna’s view it was a race against time to bring him to justice.This was chillingly confirmed when Magnotta sent her a video taken as she walked through her place of work. ‘I know who you are and I know where you work,’ Magnotta tells Deanna on the clip. Her own life was at risk.         Stabbed to death: Jun Lin was attacked by Luka Magnotta with a screwdriver. ‘The more I read about Jun Lin, it hit me so hard that I’d worked 18 months to get this person stopped, and then he committed murder,’ Deanna said laterThe Facebook sleuths begged Magnotta to seek help, but to no avail. They made several attempts to pass their vast cache of evidence to Canadian police but heard nothing back – until their worst fears proved correct.In 2012, Magnotta posted a new video, entitled 1 Lunatic, 1 Ice Pick. It showed a blurred figure stabbing a naked man 100 times with a screwdriver. The killer had moved on to humans. The screwdriver was painted silver, which it was later discovered had been to make it look like the ice pick used by Sharon Stone’s character in the erotic thriller Basic Instinct.A torso was found in a suitcase outside Magnotta’s apartment in Montreal, along with binbags stained with blood, a dead puppy and Magnotta’s ID. Any remaining doubts were dismissed when it turned out that Magnotta had been caught on CCTV casually disposing of the items and – such was his narcissism – checking his reflection on the way back into the building.Viewers are told that Magnotta dismembered the corpse – although it is not clear how – and that he sent various body parts to the headquarters of Canada’s two leading political parties.The killing of 33-year-old Jun Lin, a Chinese engineering student, had a devastating effect on Deanna. For all her efforts, she had been powerless to help.‘The more I read about Jun Lin, it hit me so hard that I’d worked 18 months to get this person stopped, and then he committed murder,’ she said later.Finally, Canadian police were obliged to act, sending Magnotta’s details to forces around the world, and he was apprehended in Berlin on June 4, 2012, in an internet cafe. The owner recognised Magnotta from newspaper reports and flagged down a passing officer.Magnotta had been looking up his own mugshot on the Interpol website at the time.So reviled was the murderer that no airline company would fly him back to Montreal and a plane from the Royal Canadian Air Force had to be used instead. Magnotta\u0027s lawyers claimed he was schizophrenic but the prosecution argued that he had faked the condition and, instead, suffered borderline personality disorder.In December 2014, he was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.Whatever the truth about his mental state, he showed little or no emotion when confronted with his crimes. ‘You see him being given a photo of Jun Lin and he doesn’t even react,’ says director Mark Lewis. ‘He was far more focused on making it clear to people that he had been a model and an actor.’Deeply conflicted about the role they played in trying to track down Magnotta, Deanna and her group of online crusaders were initially wary about taking part in the Netflix documentary.They were haunted that Magnotta might not have resorted to murder had they not provided the very audience he seemed to crave.‘One of the things which keeps me up sometimes at night is, were we complicit in his crimes?’ she asks. ‘Maybe I did exactly what the killer wanted. These people don’t deserve our attention.‘There are so many people in society loving true crime and serial killer documentaries. Every killer has fans.‘People write to these guys in prison. It’s insane. I am guilty of that as well. I watch these documentaries. I’m in one now.’Deanna’s campaign is far from over. Her group has launched an online organisation which seeks to alert local authorities to animal abusers and has played a role in a number of successful arrests.In the final moments of the documentary, however, she poses a troubling question about our ever-increasing fascination with true crime.‘You at home, watching a whole documentary about Luka Magnotta – are you complicit?’ she asks, before concluding: ‘Perhaps it’s time we turned off the machine.’"},{"url":null,"title":"British pensioner 80 set marry Egyptian toyboy 35 insists hes NOT freeloader","story":"Share this article Despite only having just met, they decided to get married in Cairo, but the British Embassy told Iris she would need her orce papers and also a certificate of no impediment proving she was free to wed again. Before returning to England, Iris met Mohamed\u0027s mother, 70, who has given the pair her blessing and said they \u0027got on like a house on fire\u0027.Iris, who orced her ex-husband more than 40 years ago, is now saving up to return to Egypt  and marry Mohamed, who is from Giza.Her sons, Steve, 54 and Darren, 53, have expressed concerns over the relationship, but Iris insists Mohamed is not after her money or a British passport - and their love for one another is real.            Iris flew out to Egypt in November to meet Mohamed for the first time - and the pair fell in loveSpeaking to Sunday People, the former cleaner, who lives off her state pension and disability benefit, said: \u0027If he\u0027s marrying me for my fortune he\u0027ll be sadly disappointed, because I live on a pension. \u0027I\u0027ve spent years making other people happy, now I just want to marry the man I love before I die.\u0027 Mohamed also insists their relationship is genuine and said that \u0027love has no age\u0027.He said: \u0027It is not right people look at everything through materialism.

As a result, he was hired by Tina Brown as Tatler’s society photographer, with an insider’s eye for the edge between observation and satire. When Brown moved to New York in 1984 to edit Vanity Fair, Jones moved too, in 1988.Nearly a decade later, in 1997, he was sent to photograph Vanity Fair’s annual Oscars bash by Brown’s successor as editor, Graydon Carter. He was struggling to find a good image until he noticed Mick Jagger sitting by himself looking bored, the world’s least likely wallflower. “Madonna crossed the room and sat down next to him,” Jones recalls. “She started talking and he became quite animated. Then Tony Curtis came along and sat down at the same table on the other side and started monopolising Madonna. Jagger was on his own again and looked miserable.”For whatever reason, the magazine did not use the picture – perhaps it did not want to advertise its own party as the place where Mick Jagger had no mates – but it was part of a selection of Vanity Fair photos for the National Portrait Gallery, and is included in a new exhibition of Jones’s work at the Leica Gallery. Jones left Vanity Fair not long after this picture was taken to join Brown at her ill-fated Talk publishing venture with Harvey Weinstein.

NSW Health said on Sunday afternoon a fourth person had tested positive, according to their preliminary test results, though more follow-up was needed.Three men are in hospital in Sydney after flying in from China, while another man in his 50s is being treated in Melbourne.Coronavirus has killed 56 people in China and the city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the illness, remains in lockdown. Almost 2,000 people have been infected with the virus in China, and cases have been also been confirmed in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, France, Malaysia and the United States.“I would not be surprised if there are some more cases ... it’s highly likely that we may see them some more.“We are incredibly well prepared to isolate and deal with that.”Meanwhile, the Australian government is exploring options to evacuate Australian nationals stuck inside the locked down areas of China, around Wuhan city in central Hubei province.The foreign minister, Marise Payne, said her department was “working closely with Chinese authorities and international partners to consider possible assistance with travel for Australians from areas that are affected by Chinese travel restrictions”.“Given the circumstances of the spread of the coronavirus, Chinese authorities are currently imposing very tight restrictions on all travel from Hubei. We are seeking advice from the Chinese authorities on these restrictions and whether any options are available to international travellers.”Removing Australian citizens from cities that are under an effective lockdown, enforced by the military, is a logistical challenge.There are checkpoints surrounding cities such as Wuhan, but whether exceptions are being made for foreign nationals, or on other grounds, is unclear. People brought out of sequestered areas would likely need to be quarantined somewhere else.The US and France have already announced plans to evacuate their citizens. The US is flying a charter flight from Wuhan to San Francisco bringing its diplomats and other consular personnel out of the country. It has said it will have “limited capacity” for private US citizens, and will prioritise those at “greater risk” from the illness.French automaker PSA Group says it will evacuate its employees and their families from Wuhan in central China, quarantine them in another major Chinese city and then bring them back to France.The foreign ministry said French officials were studying “eventual options” for all its nationals to leave if they wish.Two of the men hospitalised in Sydney flew directly from Wuhan, a 53-year-old on 20 January and a 43-year-old two days prior. The third man, aged 35, arrived from the southern city of Shenzhen on 6 January.A fourth, also aged in his 50s, was Australia’s first confirmed case of the virus after he touched down in Melbourne from Guangzhou on 19 January. He had previously been in Wuhan, where the virus is thought to have originated in an illegal wildlife market.Only the 53-year-old man is thought to have been contagious while travelling to Australia. He flew to Sydney on China Eastern Airlines flight MU749, and authorities are obtaining details of other passengers on that flight.Meanwhile, passengers on China Southern Airlines flight CZ321 from Guangzhou to Melbourne on 19 January are also being contacted as a precaution.Chinese authorities are scrambling to stop the spread of the deadly illness, restricting transport in the Hubei province including its capital Wuhan.Experts are still learning about the virus and Murphy said it was important people arriving from Wuhan, as well as those in close contact with them, look out for symptoms of fever, cough, sore throat, vomiting and difficulty breathing.Australians are being told not to travel to Wuhan or Hubei province."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f04a0c498ef7a5612eac9d7b02f0fd67c88a0fe/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=030b60d3d6add04fc65757a1554339a8","title":"10 best debut novelists 2020 paul mendez abi dare anappara elaine feeney beth morrey douglas stuart","story":"All first-time authors dream of becoming bestsellers.  The Observer’s past picks have included Sally Rooney and Jessie Burton – who among this year’s crop will make it big?Spring is a time for new beginnings in the books world, especially when it comes to fiction – not so much for established authors, who tend to unveil their new work in the autumn, as for fiction debutants hoping to become the next Sally Rooney or Jessie Burton.For the seventh year running the Observer New Review has chosen a select group of first-time British novelists we believe will make their mark. Our selection procedure was rigorous, with all eligible novels being scrutinised for readability and literary merit by a handful of editors on the New Review. And the class of 2020 looks particularly promising. Among those who made the grade were a poet, a journalist, a former teacher and an actor. The subjects they take on range from modern love in Hong Kong, child kidnapping in India and the Japanese marriage breakup industry to life inside Glasgow’s gangland and murder in a women’s refuge.What makes us so sure these new writers will stand out from the crowd? Our track record speaks for itself. Former New Review debut novelists include both Rooney and Burton, Gail Honeyman, Emma Healey, Oynikan Braithwaite and Sara Collins, winner of this year’s Costa debut novel award. Interestingly, two of our chosen writers are Irish, demonstrating that the exciting new wave of Irish writing kicked off by authors such as Rooney and Booker prizewinner Anna Burns is no flash in the pan. And having called in recent years for publishers to address the scarcity of new black and minority ethnic writers, we are delighted to present our most erse group of first-time authors yet, with four BAME writers out of the 10. Only two are men. Does this mean the days of the Great White Male Author are numbered? We shall see.They say write what you know – and 37-year-old Paul Mendez had plenty of material to draw on for his first novel, Rainbow Milk. Like his protagonist, Jesse, Mendez was raised in the Black Country as a Jehovah’s Witness, and “disfellowshipped” by the group at 17. Like Jesse, Mendez moved to London and became a male escort and sex worker, part of a journey of self-discovery that forms the core of his beautifully assured book.He spent several years transforming his experiences into fiction: “There were times when to write something directly autobiographical would have simply been to bleed my heart out on to the page,” he says. “There are things that happened to me in it, but the details are far different.”Rainbow Milk will be published by Dialogue Books, a Hachette imprint founded in 2017 to publish under-represented voices, headed up by Sharmaine Lovegrove. Mendez had met her at a party in 2012, but it wasn’t until he read about Dialogue that he followed up: “I sent her a sprawling 300-page manuscript on her first day,” he laughs.Mendez lives in Hampstead and is studying for an MA in black British writing at Goldsmiths.What made you want to be a writer?I was raised studying the Bible with adults – and it’s the greatest book ever, right? So my literacy accelerated at a very young age. Books have just always been the thing I’ve never been able to escape words.When did you start writing?I was always encouraged by my English teacher to write, but Witnesses don’t encourage any kind of creative application, so it was a real conflict. I quit an engineering degree in 2002 to write. My family isn’t at all literary and when I told them I had a novel coming out, one uncle asked if I’d had a ghost writer. They’re wonderful people – just very different. They’re still Jehovah’s Witnesses, and they think I’m stupid: I was taught the “truth” and decided to go against that. I’ve tried to give up on them, but I really can’t. They may give up on me after this book comes out – who knows?”What do you think about the world of books and publishing in 2020?I think it’s our great hope! Dialogue Books, Merky Books, Jacaranda Books – all of these imprints are now around, looking for people with different and very valid voices. We’re in a good place.What do you need to work?I need boringness – for nothing to be happening.Have you been mentored or particularly encouraged by anyone?It was a fantastic leap of faith on Sharmaine’s part to say “I believe in you, you can write – go away and do it.” I needed someone to do that.What books have inspired you to be a writer?James Baldwin – say no more! And Alan Hollinghurst’s The Line of Beauty: it was one of the things that made me realise I could write through the voice of a gay black protagonist.What books are currently on your bedside table?The Vanishing Half by Brit Bennett, Gender Trouble by Judith Butler, and Flèche by Mary Jean Chan.What single piece of advice would you offer to aspiring writers?Keep. Going.What’s the best and worst thing about being a writer?There’s two amazing things: being part of a community of brilliant people, and always having the ability to put your thoughts into words. Therapy is great – but it’s also great to be able to open your laptop and talk to yourself. The worst thing? So far, nothing!Interview by Holly WilliamsAbi Daré, 38, was born in Lagos, Nigeria, where she planned to study French at the local university. Her mum had other ideas and at the end of one summer holiday in the UK Daré found herself “tricked” into staying on to study law at the London campus of the University of Wolverhampton. These days, she’s a proper enough Londoner to have moved out to Essex, but wWhen she first arrived, she chronicled her immigrant experience in a blog that drew hundreds of thousands of hits. In fact, it became so successful she had to delete it because she felt her privacy was being invaded. Aside from the importance of not using your real name online, the blog taught her that she could truly write, so she replaced it with fictional stories shared among friends and family. The Girl With the Louding Voice began as the thesis for her creative writing MA at Birkbeck, University of London, and wound up winning the Bath novel award for emerging authors, before being tussled over in a five-way publisher auction. Its heroine is 14-year-old Adunni, a village girl who longs for an education. Instead, she’s sold into a brutal marriage from which she escapes, only to become trapped as a domestic servant in Lagos, where she’s haunted by her predecessor’s disappearance. To save herself, she must find her “louding” voice. The novel has already been chosen for BBC Radio 2’s Book Club, and Daré hopes it will shine a light on the plight of the real-life Adunnis who continue to be exploited.How did you come to write this book?As a child, I noticed that a lot of families – including mine – had informal housemaids, many of them uneducated and ill-treated, and as young as eight or 10. When my own daughters got to be that age, I found myself wondering whether it was still happening. I read an article about a 13-year-old who had been scalded with boiling water by the woman who employed her, and what really got to me was that her face was a blur in the photograph. It was to protect her identity, but I thought, who is this girl? What’s her story? My book was born out of trying to provide answers.What do you think about the world of books and publishing in 2020 – rude health or room for improvement?It’s come a long way. I’ve gone from not seeing books by authors like myself on the shelves to seeing a lot more but publishing is still not representative enough.Where do you write and what is your work schedule?I have a full-time job overseeing app development, so I do a lot on the go. In fact, I’m talking to you from a watch I bought so that I can text myself when I get ideas. I wrote most of The Girl With the Louding Voice in a coffee shop where there was a poster of a girl that the chain’s foundation was supporting. She had the brightest smile, and it felt like she was saying: “Keep going, do it for me!”What do you need to work?I like background noise when I’m writing and being creative, but I like silence to edit so I go to the London Library, where I was given a wonderful scholarship. I also get quite inspired in the shower.What books have inspired you to be a writer?Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s books showed me that if she could do it, I could.What books are currently on your bedside table?A Woman Is No Man by Etaf Rum and Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens are both on my Kindle.Are you working on your second book and if so what is it about?I am but it’s at the point where what it’s about changes every day. I never used to be a plotter but I had a disastrous manuscript a few years ago that was 100,000 words of nothing, so I at least need to have an end scene in my mind now.Best and worst things about being a writer?The worst thing is when you’re just not able to get the words out. The best? One is obviously writing a story that I enjoy, another is getting good feedback. When people say “I loved this”, or “Your book opened my eyes”, that beats any feeling. Interview by Hephzibah AndersonAuthor of Djinn Patrol on the Purple Line (Chatto \u0026amp Windus, 30 January)Deepa Anappara grew up in Kerala, India, and worked as a journalist for 12 years, in Bengaluru, Mumbai and Delhi, reporting on the impact of poverty and religious violence on the education of children. She moved to the UK in 2008 and embarked on an MA in creative writing at the University of East Anglia, where she began work on her debut novel, Djinn Patrol on the Purple Line. Submitting extracts of the novel to various prizes for unpublished fiction in the hope that a longlisting might help secure her an agent, Anappara went on to win a host of awards including the Lucy Cavendish fiction prize in 2018, which recognises literary merit and “unpoutdownability” and whose previous recipients include Gail Honeyman and Sara Collins. The novel became the subject of a nine-way bidding war and has since sold to 20 international territories and received advance praise from literary figures including Anne Enright and Ian McEwan, a historical novel, as part of her PhD in creative and critical Writing at UEA.What made you want to be a writer?I can’t remember a time when I didn’t want to write. But I come from a background where you’re expected to work for a living so if you sit around making up stuff it’s seen as a luxury and indulgence that you can’t really afford. So I chose journalism because it allowed me to write and also point to the inequities in the society in which I was born and raised.How did you come to write this book?As a reporter in India, I came across stories about the disappearance of children. More than 20 children had gone missing over two or three years and no action had been taken to find them because these people had no money or political power, and they were being ignored by government institutions. My interest was always in the children’s stories: I wondered what it would be like to be a child seeing your friends disappear and be aware you’re in danger yourself.If you had to sell the book in a sentence what would you say?It’s a coming-of-age story about a nine-year-old boy who fancies himself to be a detective and tries to uncover why children are disappearing from his neighbourhood, exploring the impact of a horrific tragedy on a community neglected by the outside world, and the bonds that help people survive difficult times.What do you think about the world of books and publishing in 2020?I’d like to see books by more writers of colour and those books get more publicity. I’d like there to be more emphasis on different ways of storytelling. There’s a difference in how stories are told in different countries and we don’t see that variety.What books have inspired you to be a writer?The first writers I read were in my mother tongue Malayalam. Kamala Das and Sarah Joseph showed me that women writers could, and must, write about subjects that were considered taboo in the conservative society in which I grew up. I read VS Naipaul’s A House for Mr Biswas at a time when my parents were struggling to put together the money for their own house, and it was the first time I had seen people like us being represented in fiction in English.What single piece of advice would you offer aspiring writers?I heard Anne Enright say that the students of hers who got published were those who didn’t give up and that’s really stuck with me. You have to keep working, keep trying, keep persisting.Interview by Hannah BeckermanIrish poet Elaine Feeney’s first novel, As You Were, is set over the course of one week in a chaotic hospital ward – a context rich in both tragedy and comedy. Feeney, who lives in Athenry in west Ireland, has some experience of hospitals, having spent some time in one after complications following the birth of her second son. “The novel went into a completely fictional space, but what I was thinking about was the camaraderie between people who would ordinarily never be together,” she says. Plus, “no one had private rooms, so you hear everything”. Feeney has already published three collections of poetry and has written as many discarded novels. “There was an anxiety around writing a novel that I didn’t feel around writing poetry, weirdly,” she says. “Also I had my first son quite young – I was only 22 – and poetry was quicker.”What made you want to be a writer?Reading. I was a very isolated, introverted kid, and I loved books. I started off with Hans Christian Andersen, the Grimm Brothers, Black Beauty….How did you come to write this book?I started to write As You Were around the end of 2014, it took four years and it was a hard write. But I had this voice of the narrator, Sinead, and I just kept knocking.What do you think about the world of books and publishing in 2020?People are reading books again – we worried it was all screens, but people have gone back to books.Where do you write and what is your work schedule?I teach boys at a Catholic secondary school, and creative writing at the university in Galway, and I have two sons. So I am busy! I plonked my desk in the big open-plan kitchen in our bungalow and I just put headphones on and do the work. It’s the house I grew up in, so it’s got a very weird energy. When my parents were selling I said I’d buy it I like being rooted.What books have inspired you?Edna O’Brien. Maeve Binchy. The poetry we did in school was extremely important: I found my teens quite hard, and I remember reading Patrick Kavanagh’s Inniskeen Road which is about isolation – and I discovered: “Oh, this isn’t a unique feeling, you can get through this.”What books are currently on your bedside table?I’m reading a very strange book that came out in the 90s called I Could Read the Sky by Timothy O’Grady. It’s the tightest prose.What is the best debut novel you’ve read?Pond by Claire-Louise Bennett. It’s stunning. She’s also my friend! But we write completely differently: I think I give her a headache when I talk about all of my characters.Are you working on your second book?I’m interested in the workings of institutions and power in everyday life. My next one is going to be set in a rightwing Catholic school.What single piece of advice would you offer to aspiring writers?Pay it forward if you get a break – don’t be an ass, be nice.Beth Morrey, 42, grew up in Derbyshire before studying English at Cambridge, and left university with ambitions to become a comedy writer. A career in factual television beckoned instead and she eventually joined the production company RDF Television, rising to become creative director, responsible for shows including The Secret Life of Four-Year-Olds and 100-Year-Old Drivers. It was while on maternity leave that she decided to embrace her long-held ambition to write a novel and the result, Saving Missy, became the subject of a 10-publisher auction and has since sold in 16 overseas territories. It’s a book about community, loneliness and unexpected friendships, continuing the trend for “up lit”.What made you want to be a writer?I wanted to see my name on the spine of a book in a bookshop. I’ve always written since I was about five, when I wrote a story about Icarus. I wrote in television but I wanted to be a writer of books.If you had to sell the book in a sentence, what would you say?I wanted to write a book about hope that would make people cry in a happy way.Where do you write and what is your work schedule?It’s very strict. I go for a run and then I write from 10am-2pm in a cafe that I love. I like background noise and chatter because I find I can tune in and out of it. And then I come home, have lunch and edit until about 5pm, when I go and pick up my kids.What books have inspired you to be a writer?About a Boy by Nick Hornby was a huge influence on me. I really like that sparse, puritan prose where it seems straightforward but it’s not. And Sue Townsend – I grew up with the Adrian Mole books, adored them, read them over and over again.What are the best and worst things about being a writer?The best thing is when stuff comes out of your head that surprises you: that’s wonderful. The worst thing is the scrutiny. I know that not everyone is going to like my book and I’ve just got to take it on the chin.What single piece of advice would you offer to aspiring writers?Lots of people say: “I’ve got a book in me.” But they never actually get around to it. It’s hard to get to the end of a book, to write those 90,000 words. And so I’d say, if you write to that extent then you are a writer, and what happens after that is just luck. HBDouglas Stuart was brought up on a housing estate in 1980s Glasgow. His alcoholic mother died when he was 16 he never met his father. He studied textiles in Galashiels and then the Royal College of Art. For the past 20 years, he has lived and worked as a fashion designer in New York, first for Calvin Klein, then Ralph Lauren, then as head of design for Gap. Most recently, he designed for Jack Spade. Shuggie Bain tells the story of awkward, lonely Hugh “Shuggie” Bain and his ambitious, charismatic mother, Agnes, as they try to protect each other – and themselves – amid the brutal destitution of Thatcher’s Britain.What made you want to be a writer?I always wanted to be a writer. Fashion has provided me with a wonderful life, but I’ve been writing now for 12 years in private, in secret, for myself. I didn’t write this book with any notion of it being published, of it even being read by someone else. What I decided when I turned 40 a few years ago was that it was time to take a sabbatical. I had dreams that were going unanswered and those were dreams of writing. So I took time out to write and showed Shuggie to a friend in publishing and the response has just been phenomenal.If you had to sell the book in a sentence, what would you say?It’s a love story about two souls trapped in a hyper-masculine world who are struggling to get by, to survive, to love each other.Where do you write and what is your work schedule?I need complete silence, which is very hard to achieve in New York as there’s construction going on around me all the time. The most important thing that I own is a pair of noise-cancelling headphones and every morning, at about seven, they go on and I immerse myself in my work. I’m an early-morning writer. Because New York is such a cramped real estate market I have to wait for my husband to stop banging coffee mugs and the dishwasher and leave for work. I get up before he gets up in the morning, then I take a couple of hours off to hang out with him, then when he goes off to work I get straight back to it.Best debut you have read?Morvern Callar by Alan Warner. Here was a book where I saw people like myself reflected and I could really empathise with Morvern’s desire to escape from the world she was in. It knocked me sideways.What books are currently on your bedside table?I’m currently reading And the Land Lay Still by James Robertson. It’s a book that’s been out for 10 years or so. I’m also rereading Young Adam by Alexander Trocchi and then also The Trick Is to Keep Breathing by Janice Galloway. A book I’ve just finished and loved is Lowborn by Kerry Hudson. It’s a wonderful book, such quiet grace.Best and worst things about being a writer?The worst thing is the loneliness, especially coming from an industry which is all about dynamic team-building, and I sometimes find myself feeling isolated, but the best thing is the focus that loneliness brings. So for both sides of the question the answer is loneliness.What single piece of advice would you offer to aspiring writers?Don’t fear if you don’t come from a certain background. Find what it is only you can offer the world and put that on the page.Interview by Alex PrestonTwenty-seven-year-old Jessica Moor lives in Berlin but was born in south-east London and her debut novel, Keeper, started life while she was doing an MA in creative writing at Manchester University, where she was mentored by Jeanette Winterson. A literary thriller, Keeper is a compelling, tense and pacy read, with a central character who works in a women’s refuge. Moor herself worked for a domestic violence charity for a while after finishing her BA. “It was a bit of a ‘road not taken’,” she says. “I was thinking about training to be a psychotherapist and I needed a day job that would lead to a relevant field. But I was also drawn to it because I’m very much a feminist, although, looking back, I feel like my feminism was quite underdeveloped at that point.” The role developed her thinking. “It made me feel that everything is connected, and that there is a dismissal of women and the control of women’s bodies that underpins everything… there’s an ideology behind it and the logical conclusion of that ideology is violence against women.” Your book describes controlling, coercive behaviour. Is this something you have experienced?I’ve certainly felt it in the world around me in my past relationships, and in my friends’ relationships and this was one of the things I understood better after working for the domestic violence organisation – there’s a continuum of behaviour. It starts with texting, you know, saying: “Where are you? Who are you with? What are you wearing?” Which I and lots of my friends have experienced. It’s not healthy, but it is common. And that is on a spectrum of behaviour. It’s entitlement, and it’s the failure to treat women as fully autonomous beings.What’s the best debut you have read?Anne Michaels’s Fugitive Pieces was a debut novel, wasn’t it? I think it is a masterpiece.What books are currently on your bedside table?I’m reading Samantha Power’s The Education of an Idealist at the moment, which I’m massively enjoying. I relate to her a lot, her slightly morbid fascination with the world’s suffering and a sort of rampant catastrophising.What is your second book about?It’s historical and, again, my way in is through a violence-against-women lens. My ambition is to be a sort of feminist hermit crab and to go into different genres and unpick them and see what’s there that may have been suppressed. Interview by Ursula KennyAuthor of What’s Left of Me Is Yours (Orion, 21 April)Stephanie Scott was born and raised in Singapore. She came to the UK to study English at university, where she specialised in Renaissance literature. Just as she was starting her PhD at Cambridge, she decided that she couldn’t face the idea of “being locked in a garret,” and took a job on the hedge fund desk at Lehman Brothers. Working late nights on deals, she’d dream of becoming a novelist and scan the websites of creative writing courses. She finally took the plunge, applying to study at the Faber Academy and on Oxford University’s creative writing master’s programme. “I was accepted on both and so I decided to do both, to really pursue writing seriously.” Scott’s debut, What’s Left of Me Is Yours, delves into the murky world of Japanese marriage-wreckers to tell a strange and tragic love story.How did you come to write this book?I read an article by Richard Lloyd Parry of the Financial Times about a real-life crime. In that case a marriage break-up agent had strangled his lover when she discovered his true profession and threatened to leave him. The agent was arrested at the scene and confessed to police, but as he was speaking to the police he said: “I loved her, I love her still.” And it’s the humanity of that original story that drew me to it.I was newly married at the time and was thinking a lot about love and enduring relationships. I kept wondering about that idea: can you love someone and kill them? Because love ideally requires selflessness, but then I thought perhaps there are as many different types of love as there are people.Where do you write and what is your work schedule?I need to be at my desk in my study. I need to know what I’m writing about. A lot of the novel was drafted by just writing what I wanted without planning out where it was going but, having said that, the novel is so research-based that I had to have the grounding in place before I could begin it.Have you been mentored or particularly encouraged by anyone? If so by whom and how?I was taught on the Faber novel course by Louise Doughty and Louise has been hugely supportive of this novel from beginning to end. By the time it comes out it will have been 10 years in the making. She has been an extraordinary mentor. She was instrumental in my finally deciding to leave finance and focus on the book, which was a crazy thing to do at the time.Best debut you have read?My Sister the Serial Killer by Oyinkan Braithwaite. I absolutely adored it.What single piece of advice would you offer aspiring writers?Persevere and believe in yourself and your project. APAt just 27, Naoise (pronounced “Neesha”) Dolan is remarkably self-assured and laid-back about the prospect of becoming a published novelist. “It seems like a nice job to have,” she says breezily. Born in Dublin, she studied English at Trinity College but had never seen writing as anything more than “a hobby I enjoyed, like playing the piano and drawing”, until she took a creative writing course in her final year. “That was a game-changer. I came out of it pretty much saying, ‘I want to write a book’,” she says.A year teaching English in Hong Kong provided the setting and subject matter for Exciting Times, the story of a love triangle that also explores class, colonialism, language and more, while also being frank about female sexuality. Dolan’s friend Sally Rooney (a couple of years ahead at Trinity), published the first chapter in her literary journal, Stinging Fly, and a seven-way publishers’ scrum ensued. Is she, as the industry buzz suggests, the next Rooney? We’ll see when her novel hits bookshops in April.If you had to sell the book in a sentence, what would you say?I think I’d say it’s about love, money and the intimate lives of three young cynics living in Hong Kong – and I would do my best to keep a straight face.Is there anything you need to work?I’m completely dependent on coffee but that’s not writing-specific: I’d be a shell of a human being without it.What books have inspired you to be a writer?I always loved the Victorians. They were pretty much a special interest since my early teens, which is why I did a master’s in Victorian literature at Oxford after I’d been to Hong Kong. I think of all of them, Dickens has inspired me the most because he has got what very few people have, which is the ability to construct this compelling story but also to write absolutely wonderfully at a line-by-line level. On any page of Dickens you’ve got a really unusual cluster of words or something really funny or true, but you really want to find out what happens next as well.What are the best and worst things about being a writer?Best is having a book always humming in your mind. It’s really nice, even when something miserable happens in your day, to be able to think, maybe I can work that into the story. It helps you make sense of everything else in your life. Worst is people expecting you to be precious about your book and treat it like your baby, because I am not sentimental like that at all. For my mother, for instance, the idea of me being edited was this offensive thing, while I’m like: “Yeah, let’s get the scalpel out, let’s fix it.”What single piece of advice would you offer to aspiring writers?Ignore the whole social performance of being a literary person. That thing of feeling you have to go to book launches or that all your friends have to be writers. That stuff is irrelevant to writing a book and it can take up a lot of your time and money if you let it. It’s not what makes you a writer. Interview by Lisa O’KellyLouise Hare, 39, works in the travel industry and did a part-time MA in creative writing at Birkbeck, London University. Her debut novel grew out of a short story written in her first semester. Set in postwar south London, it tells the story of Lawrie – a young Jamaican musician recently arrived on the Empire Windrush – and Evie, the mixed-race girl girl next door with whom he falls in love. Hare herself is mixed race – “half Nigerian, half British” – and grew up in Warrington in Cheshire where she lived with her adoptive (white) parents and brother before moving to London 13 or so years ago. Hare’s timely story (written before the Windrush scandal was revealed) foregrounds the racism and bigotry the Windrush arrivals encountered. The idea to write about that era took root after a visit Hare made to a deep level shelter below Clapham Common which was used, for a while, to house passengers from the Windrush. “Can you imagine?” she asks. “Being on that boat for ages, getting off and they put you down there.”What made you want to be a writer?About five years ago, I realised that although I don’t hate my job, the thought of doing it for another 30 to 40 years filled me with dread. I thought, if I could find something I really loved what would that be?How much had you written before?There wasn’t that much creative writing at school, so it has always been in my own time. In my 20s, a couple of times I sat down to write and just found that I didn’t really have anything to say. It wasn’t until I got to about 35 that I thought, I want to read a different kind of book. I was in a book club at the time with a couple of people who were mixed-race and we were always talking about how the books we wanted to read just didn’t exist. And I thought, well, wouldn’t it be great if I could write something that I want to read? So I spent two years writing a book that’s now in a drawer somewhere. I sent it out to loads of agents and got some nice feedback including from my now agent, but nobody was interested enough to publish it. That was when I signed up to the MA, to have something to feel positive about and to see if I was actually any good.Which writers inspired you? I love Sarah Waters’s books. I like what she does, putting LGBT characters into historical novels. I like Andrea Levy as well. I’ll also say James Baldwin: I read Another Country a couple of times during the writing of this book because it’s got a lot of jazz in so I wanted to see how he had sort of infused his writing with the music. And I’d also say Marlon James, in terms of current writers. I love what he’s doing.What books are on your bedside table?I’ve just finished Nora Ephron’s Heartburn which is very funny. I’ve also got an advance copy of a short story collection by Zora Neale Hurston which is a reissue as well. I’m doing a bit of research for a potential book that I don’t have a story for yet so I’ve got a book called War to Windrush by Stephen Bourne which is about black women in Britain during the second world war.What’s the best debut you have read?Children of Blood and Bone by Tomi Adeyemi. I thought it was brilliant.You got a six-figure sum for a two-book deal from HarperCollins. What is your second book about?It’s written already and it’s set in 1936, partly in Soho but mainly aboard the Queen Mary going from Southampton to New York. It’s a murder mystery.

But their mood was melancholy rather than triumphant.“I’ve been shopping here for 50 years,” said Gray. “It’s always been the store to come to. It will be such a shame if it vanished from this street and a disaster for the town centre. Our generation grew up with stores like this. They’re a big part of our lives.”Southworth agreed. “I know people do shop online now but I never would. I like to see and touch what I’m buying before I pay for it. If all the department stores go, I’ll just have to make do with the stuff I’ve got.”The news that the grand old store (est 1881 motto: “It has to be Beales”) had gone into administration was greeted with disbelief in the Dorset resort.But Beales is simply the latest collapse amid the continuing devastation on Britain’s high streets. In just the first three weeks of this year 9,949 jobs have been lost, according to the Centre for Retail Research (CRR), with store closures at Debenhams, GAME, HMV, Arcadia and Mothercare.The toy chain Hawkin’s Bazaar went into administration last week, while Asda and Morrisons announced plans to cut thousands of back office and management roles.Last year there was about 140,000 job losses in retail were axed, with experts predicting 2020 could be even worse. Competition from booming online retailers such as Amazon is usually blamed for the accelerating collapse of the high street, but the CRR – and shoppers at Beales – said stores were also falling victim to punitive business ratesIn Bournemouth, Suzanne Hesketh said she had been buying household goods from Beales for just about as long she could remember.“I bought a set of saucepans from here 25 years ago. They’re still going strong. We bought a three-piece suite here. It was too soft but their after-sale service was fantastic. This store is part of our history.“I think business rates are too high and lots of shops are closing. The council is on to a good thing, the owners of the buildings are on to a good thing. They are charging huge rates and rents. We’ve got to do something or we will lose our high streets. It’s a shame.”Beales was opened by John Elmes Beale under the name Fancy Fair and Oriental House, selling products and novelties that reflected the growing enthusiasm for Chinese and Japanese design. The original store was bombed in the second world war but rebuilt on the same site on Old Christchurch Road.In the 1990s it floated on the stock exchange before returning to private ownership. It expanded and Beales now operates 23 department stores from the Lake District to Norfolk, selling furniture, fashion, toys and cosmetics and employing more than 1,000 people.Bournemouth remains the flagship store. It is much more than a shop. It is also a place for friends to meet. Its canopy is a shelter for homeless people and Jehovah’s Witnesses. Many people wonder where they will find a comfortable toilet if Beales closes.Charlotte Mason and her three-year grandson, Huxley, came out of the shop having found a toy motorcycle for the boy. “It’s a big landmark for the town. It would be sorely missed,” said Mason. “And we’ll be left with another bloody empty shop.”Josh Wright, who covers council matters for the Bournemouth Echo, was treating himself to new kitchen knives and a chopping board. “It’s the first place you notice when you walk down this street.” But he admits to being part of the problem: he does most of his shopping online.Beales’ problems have caused a political row on the south coast. The store asked Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council to exempt it from paying business rates, an eye-watering £440,000 a year.The council, which is run by a coalition including Liberal Democrats, Labour and independents, declined. The council leader, Vikki Slade, a Lib Dem, said: “Unfortunately, we are not able to grant such exemptions as business rates are a national tax which we are required to collect on behalf of government.“Any financial support to the store would have had to come out of council budgets and this would therefore have a direct impact on council service delivery.”One of the Bournemouth MPs, the international trade minister Conor Burns, said the council’s approach was “reckless and short-sighted”, arguing that councils did have the power to give business rate discounts under section 69 of the Localism Act 2011.It is not all bleak on the high street in Bournemouth.Nat Rendell, who owns an independent “skate, streetwear and sneaker” store, moved out of a spot close to Beales to focus on the online side of his business. But he is moving back to Old Christchurch Road soon with a store that will include a cafe and will stage events.Alan Rowett, at The Vault vinyl records and CDs shop, makes a living by offering something different to HMV.He remembers being dragged around the store in the 1960s and 1970s. “A lot of the department stores haven’t moved with the times. My teenage kids wouldn’t dream of going in there. The generation that grew up going there is getting old and dying off, sadly. To survive shops have to strive to develop, offer something different.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ae204379daef8efc1a573d972b0dc44c5bffd8f/0_841_2674_1604/master/2674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ca90d5017131be419a56b1ddf36c42a","title":"rogue energy brokers con small businesses ofgem","story":"Ofgem is told charities, churches and micro firms are being locked into bad value dealsSmall businesses are being conned out of £2bn by rogue “energy brokers” who lock them into long-term bad value gas and electricity contracts, according to documents submitted to the energy regulator.Charities, churches and care homes are among the organisations paying far more than they should for their energy after falling prey to the unregulated brokers, the documents say.Some inidual firms are seeking payouts of up to £1m, according to one claims management firm which is seeking legal settlements for small businesses against their brokers.Ofgem plans to launch an industry call for evidence within the next few months to determine the extent of the mis-selling problem within the energy market. The report, seen by the , warned that many energy market brokers promise the best energy deal for small businesses at no charge to their client but go on to offer poor value deals picked exclusively from suppliers that offer the most lucrative terms for the brokers.A growing number of brokers can claim billions of pounds in commissions which are hidden within the inflated supply deals, many of which stretch over three to five years, according to the report.He added that energy suppliers are “completely complicit” because they help to hide the broker commission within their energy bills.Thompson said it is not unusual for small business owners to be caught out by oral agreements which are binding under existing regulation.The number of energy brokers in the UK has ballooned to around 3,000, in part because the outfits are cheap to set up, and face virtually no regulation despite the large sums of money at stake.The regulator estimates that businesses, charities and public bodies spend about £25bn to cover their energy bills every year, of which about half is bought through energy brokers. Thompson estimates that around £2.25bn of this is likely to be commission.“This won’t come as a surprise to Ofgem, they are very aware of the mis-selling in this industry,” he said. “We hope that now is the time that they start to take action on this.” The report includes case studies of unnamed companies which won back undisclosed commissions, including £10,000 on behalf of a care home, £8,200 for a charity and £3,200 for a church. Another company, with more than 200 sites nationwide, is owed £500,000 in undisclosed commission.An Ofgem spokesman said it would use the report to add to the evidence base it is building to “help understand the issues faced by micro-business consumers and ensure the market is meeting their needs.”.The regulator has been aware of mis-selling in the energy market for years, but has previously stopped short of calling for brokers to face regulation or comply with a code of conduct. Ofgem first put forward plans to protect small businesses from dishonest energy brokers in 2014, but dropped the plan after finding “inconclusive evidence” of malpractice.It revived plans to investigate broker mis-selling in 2018 after admitting that there is “room for sharp practices by some brokers”. At the time, Citizens Advice welcomed the plan but added that it is “a shame it’s taken so long for this problem to be tackled”.Thompson warned that without action the misconduct of some energy brokers is likely to get steadily worse.“The responsibility has to fall on Ofgem because ultimately the brokers aren’t going to improve their own behaviour,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4a5fd0ab04444365444ea871032e024b6ec8745/0_207_2912_1747/master/2912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50d7dfa1e45da2de95e2580e3df9096e","title":"derek jarman house queer history lgbtq prospect cottage","story":"In 1992 Derek Jarman, seriously ill with HIV, was asked what his memorial might be. “Oh, nothing,” he replied, “because film disappears, thank God.” It might seem strange to think of Jarman’s joy in the transience of his art in the context of a recently launched Art Fund campaign to raise £3.5m in 10 weeks to purchase and save Prospect Cottage, his home and workplace in Dungeness, Kent. There’s certainly an irony that more than a quarter of a century after his death an arts body is seeking to raise millions to preserve his house, when during his lifetime he faced a constant battle to finance his films.Film-maker, painter, gardener, writer and activist, Jarman moved to the wind-blasted 12 sq miles (31 sq km) of pebbles, shingle and scrub that makes up the Dungeness peninsula in the late 1980s. Prospect Cottage wasn’t merely a place of respite, as he faced the physical ordeal of his illness. He also turned this modest dwelling into an artwork in its own right. Words from John Donne’s The Sun Rising cover an external wall, beyond which Jarman created a now world-famous garden where sculptures made from the flotsam and jetsam of the Dungeness shore were given as much prominence as the crocuses, holly, roses and poppies that he planted.It was to be where he created some of his best work. The cottage and surrounding landscape provided the backdrop for his 1990 film The Garden, a visionary, psychedelic and angry polemic that retells the life of Jesus as a parable for the persecution of gay men during the Aids epidemic. His journal of these years was eventually published as a book called Modern Nature, a classic of contemporary nature writing that eschews the twee romanticism of the genre for an evocative and honest account of sexuality and illness set against the struggle to keep his garden alive.Jarman’s creative output was diffuse. His films are rarely widely screened or shown on television, while the paintings he made at Prospect Cottage (small canvases loaded with black tar and items collected from the surrounding landscape) are only occasionally exhibited, and usually in commercial galleries before being sold to private collectors. Prospect Cottage, then, is the most accessible and easily identifiable manifestation we have of Jarman’s creative energies.Since his death in 1994, the cottage was cared for and maintained by his partner, Keith Collins, who died in 2018. The intensity of the Dungeness weather that Jarman so beautifully captured both on celluloid and in words now threatens the very existence of his former home. Gales laden with salt spray and the heat and strong sunlight of the Kentish summer are enemies of the wooden building, while the increasing stream of visitors who wander through the garden and peer through the windows bring with them their own risks of wear and tear, souvenir-hunting or even robbery.In the final months of his life, Collins approached the artist Tacita Dean with his concern for the future of the property. Conversations were had, and last week the Art Fund, the Tate gallery and the local arts organisation Creative Folkestone launched their crowdfunding campaign to preserve the cottage and its contents for future generations. Yet memory and cold buildings preserved in aspic are not enough. What makes the plans for Prospect Cottage more than an attempt to turn it into a heritage tourist attraction, cream teas on hand, is an ambitious proposal to open it as a creative retreat for artists, filmmakers, writers and activists.This is especially good news for the LGBTQ+ community. Prospect Cottage has become such a place of pilgrimage over the years in part because there are so few physical spaces we can claim as a part of our cultural history. While the National Trust has done great work in recent years highlighting the untold LGBTQ+ pasts of some of its properties, Jarman’s home would be one of the first buildings preserved for the nation that has a radical and explicitly queer narrative at its heart. Jarman the activist was heavily involved in the gay rights movement, and fought homophobia until his dying day. His writings are full of accounts of travelling from Dungeness to London to participate in marches.For many people, late-night furtive viewings of Jarman films on Channel 4 in the early 1990s helped us see the world differently. I would never have written my book Out of the Woods without Jarman’s inspiration. Making Prospect Cottage a space that continues to transform lives, especially for those who might see themselves as being on the margins of society or creative culture, seems to me to be a wonderful way of furthering his legacy. As his longtime collaborator Tilda Swinton pointed out at the launch of the Art Fund campaign, Jarman was always happy for members of the public to take cuttings from the plants growing in his garden, take them home, and from them create new life.• Luke Turner is an author. His latest book is Out of the Woods"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee0f6d5ff0e2a94b3a66f302738ed11c8c07d45b/25_19_3473_2084/master/3473.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb18286f27045bdf4d2d7b9d4ed1cc5f","title":"why should keir starmer aside   his rivals have few feminist credentials","story":"After Margaret Thatcher’s death in 2013, important Labour voices explained absolutely no value attached to her allegedly symbolic achievements as a female leader.Glenda Jackson implicitly rebuked Ed Miliband, who had noted of Thatcher that “at each stage of her life, she broke the mould”, becoming “the only woman in the cabinet when she was appointed in 1970 and, of course, the first woman prime minister”.So what, Jackson argued. Since Thatcher was wrong about everything, her triumph did nothing for women, not even in principle. “To pay tribute to the first prime minister denoted by the female gender, OK but a woman? Not on my terms.” On Twitter, amid extravagant crowing about the witch being dead, the Labour MP Ian Lavery confirmed that female trailblazing is not, axiomatically, an advance. “It would be cowardly,” he announced, hours after Thatcher’s death, “for me not to comment on today’s news. No tears from me nor the mining communities destroyed by MT we R #theenemywithin.”It has since fallen to Harriet Harman, whose own career was stalled by in-party misogyny, to establish Thatcher’s eternal irrelevance as a role model. She told the ’s Simon Hattenstone how, as a young MP, with an infant in her arms, she spotted Thatcher, whom she considers “an aberration”, approaching. “She looked as if she was going to come and admire the baby. I had this terrible feeling of thinking, ‘I don’t want her to look at the baby,’ almost like one of those cartoons where the witch looks at the baby and the baby shrivels. I didn’t want my perfect baby to have Thatcher’s eyes upon him.” She added, more persuasively, that Thatcher “was not supportive of other women”.While there can be no doubt that any of the three women in Labour’s four-person leadership contest would ever knowingly shrivel a baby, the current leadership election has renewed arguments about the significance of a party leader’s sex. Emily Thornberry, who previously supported first Miliband, then Jeremy Corbyn over female candidates, says the party must now pick a woman – her – because she would frighten Boris Johnson. Having earlier supported Miliband, Burnham, then Corbyn, her colleague, Lavery, now the party’s chairman, says: “We need a female leader of the Labour party. Stand aside, Keir.”As instructive as it is to be re-educated in sex equality by Lavery, his historic reluctance to tell male candidates to “stand aside” is surely an admission that, notwithstanding the asset that is femaleness, other leadership skills such as actual policies, demonstrable competence and an attractive personality can be yet more important. If not, why not concede that Thatcher, being female, got one thing right?For Lavery, other priorities might include not being scared of Lavery, and awarding Corbyn 10 out of 10 for perfection. His fellow feminists may, however, attach greater importance to a candidate’s achievements for women. Without, for a second, dismissing any candidate as an aberration, their significance, as women, is doubtless meant to be more than physically verifiable more even than a gendered knack of looking kindly around babies. Can they cite any contributions towards, say, reducing violence against women and girls, protecting women’s rights, enhancing women’s autonomy?Apologies if I’ve missed something – although, given the detail supplied with other credentials, eg, familiarity with penury, anything notable would probably have surfaced by now. Thornberry? For a person who volunteers that her childhood cats had to be put down, presumably after the family was reduced to competing with them for mice, this infinitely adaptable MP has to date offered little by way of hard-won, womanly insights beyond a new claim, arguably more offensive than Thatcher’s household hints, that “any mother” would agree she was right to nick selective state school places (in a different county) intended for the less privileged.Though there is still time, of course, for this formerly doting apologist to discover a confidential memo in which she beseeches Corbyn not to mutter “stupid woman” under his breath.Long-Bailey? To date, the Corbynist idea of charisma appears to have achieved less for women than, despite not being a woman, did her main rival Keir Starmer, as director of public prosecutions. When he left, in 2013, Thornberry said (of the person she now calls a “machine politician”): “His values shone through with his emphasis on fighting violence against women and girls. He fulfilled a difficult role in a progressive and compassionate way… he has done his utmost to transform the CPS’s record on rape and domestic violence, delivering improved conviction rates for both.”Starmer, moreover, supports women’s reproductive autonomy. Long-Bailey favours restrictions on abortion (and likewise opposes assisted dying). Both politicians having chosen, like Thornberry, to serve Corbyn, they are contaminated, as Lisa Nandy is not, by the party’s documented misogyny its ineffectual approach to sexual misconduct. Actually, whatever did happen to the open letter, signed by more than 100 former and current staffers, about the handling of allegations against David Prescott, one of Corbyn’s senior aides, condemning “an environment where sexual harassment and bullying are not taken seriously”?And so to Nandy. Unimpeachably female. Unapologetically at ease with Brexit, and therefore with an outcome that is authoritatively predicted to hit women, via eroded legal protections and increased exposure to poverty, harder than it will men.Stand aside Keir?

Ernst Vegelin, the head of the Courtauld Gallery in London, told the researchers: “Museums are having to gravitate towards projects that are going to guarantee a return and which tend to build on pre-existing popularity, reducing the scope for encounters with unknown art forms.”LSE researcher Kristina Kolbe said the shift to more populist shows could lead to even fewer opportunities for black and minority ethnic, disabled, LGBT and female artists.Kolbe, co-author of the report, The Art World’s Response to the Challenge of Inequality, said austerity cuts had made public art institutions increasingly reliant on wealthy private collectors and mega-galleries for funds and loans of work to put on shows by major artists.Museums and galleries worried this could compromise their civic values because private donors were often pushing work by artists they own or represent to increase their value, she added.Kolbe compared this trend to insider trading. She said: “The super-rich often have the art to loan, or can support exhibitions but are also able to up the value of their own investments at the same time.”The number of mega-galleries in Mayfair, such as the Gagosian and David Zwirner, which represent blue-chip artists, has grown in the past decade, while smaller galleries in east London and Fitzrovia, which represent emerging artists, have closed.One of the most significant recent losses is the non-profit Parasol unit, which will close its gallery in Hoxton in late March. The foundation, established by Iranian-born curator Dr Ziba Ardalan, has shown many emerging international artists and recent UK art school graduates.Ardalan said the increasingly close relationship between public museums and the super-rich had left less money available for galleries like her own that had nurtured the careers of previously unrecognised artists. She said: “Sponsors would rather have their names on an exhibition by a big name artist in an established museum.”Anders Petterson, founder and managing director of art market analysts ArtTactic, said the growing dominance of super-rich collectors and mega-galleries was having a detrimental impact on the work being shown in public museums.He said: “The problem is that ersity is being strangled. The top galleries control the top artists and the top artists are in the top public museums. The model needs to change otherwise we’ll end up in a world where the art we see is controlled by the same people who control everything else.”Lucy Rose Sollitt, author of a report on the future of the art market, launched at the London Art Fair last week, said the market for risk-taking artists from more erse backgrounds was shrinking.Artist Tai Shani, one of the winners of last year’s Turner prize, said the squeeze on public art funding and smaller galleries was contributing to making fine art an unviable career for the less well-off."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f328ae4230d567c94a6f1fbd38df45cbfbe43a8/161_124_745_447/master/745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b214ecdfc88be09d1655df36080db594","title":"humpback whales bunny chow and golden beaches why you should visit durban","story":"Desperate for a dose of winter sun? South Africa’s Durban delivers 320 days of sunshine every year, as well as surfing, foodie adventures and sensational land and sea safariOnce seen as the quiet cousin of cosmopolitan Cape Town and fast-paced Johannesburg, the natural wonders and cultural charms of Durban and its surrounds put it firmly on South Africa’s must-see map. Fly direct from London Heathrow to Durban with British Airways, then get exploring.The best place for a first-look at “Durbs” – as the locals call it – is down on the Golden Mile, an iconic stretch (nearly three-miles long, not one, as its name would have you believe) of powdery beaches backed by a colourful pedestrian promenade, all of it smartened up for the 2010 World Cup.Shimmering off to the north is another legacy project of the tournament, the Moses Mabhida Stadium. An 80-metre freefall and 220-metre arc makes the Big Rush Big Swing from the stadium arch the world’s tallest swing, while the more sedate SkyCar delivers superb views of the city and its beaches.With miles of golden sand, and water that rarely dips below 20C, Durban richly deserves its reputation as South Africa’s surfing capital. Surf schools on the promenade – try Xpression or Learn 2 Surf – will have you up and riding in no time. The smaller waves of South Beach are best for beginners, while expert surfers will delight in the long tubes of New Pier.From May to November, these seas are also home to humpback and southern right whales, while Bryde’s, sperm and minke whales inhabit the oceans all year round. Look out for lobtailing, when a whale slaps its tail on the water to create waves, and breaching, when a whale launches out of the water as if ready to backflip. And that wasn’t enough, you can often spot dolphins ing in the crests of the waves. Whale and Dolphin Tours offer daily aquatic safari cruises from Durban marina the company is committed to training tour guides from disadvantaged communities and supporting Whale Time’s environmental research.Oceans aside, Durban is giving Cape Town a run for its money when it comes to culinary adventures. On tree-lined Florida Road you’ll find a neat cross section of the city’s resurgent kitchen creativity, from pan-African flavours at Dukkah to the ice-cream-filled macaroons of chef Zakeeya Mitha’s Sugarlicious. The falooda-inspired Bombay crush ice-cream is the go-to here.But when it comes to dining, Durban is all about curry. Don’t leave without braving the famous “bunny chow”: a quarter-loaf of white bread, hollowed out and filled with bean or mutton curry. You’ll find bunny chow across the city, but in Durban central the Oriental restaurant is an institution. A mutton bunny will set you back just R79.95 (£4.19).It’s also just a short walk from the colourful Victoria Street Market, where spice shops are piled high with fiery bespoke blends. Around the corner, the Juma Masjid is worth a look. It’s one of the largest mosques in the southern hemisphere, the domed facade completed in 1943.There’s certainly plenty to keep you busy in the city, but as the capital of KwaZulu-Natal province Durban is also the perfect starting point for adventures farther afield. With public transport thin on the ground, an Avis rental car is your best bet.A 20-minute drive north of the city brings you to the seaside suburb of Umhlanga, long favoured by South African holidaymakers. You’ll want to spend time exploring the walking trails of the Umhlanga Lagoon Nature Reserve, or browsing the weekly Wednesday morning farmers’ market, but first drop your bags at the Oyster Box hotel, an elegant grande dame of South Africa’s seaside hotels. The pool terrace delivers impressive views – of breaching whales and the ocean – but the attentive staff will also happily set up deckchairs and umbrellas on the beach for you. And there’s no need to venture out in search of dinner: the generous curry buffet here is legendary. Beware the fiery beef vindaloo.Another 30 minutes’ drive along the Dolphin Coast brings you to Zimbali Coastal Resort, where the Fairmont Zimbali Resort offers 154 luxury rooms, secluded beaches and easy access to the resort’s excellent 18-hole golf course, which plays through lush coastal forest. Bring plenty of spare balls.South Africa is synonymous with safari, and Phinda Private Game Reserve and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi park are just two hours’ drive farther north, with a clutch of upscale safari lodges dishing up five-star luxury and Big Five sightings. As well as lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants and buffalo, you may even catch a glimpse of the elusive cheetah.Or head west from Durban, towards the rugged peaks of the Drakensberg mountains. The uKhahlamba-Drakensberg park was declared a world heritage site in 2000, noted for its ancient San rock art and rugged scenery. The historic battlefields of central KwaZulu-Natal are also within easy reach for travellers with a car, with talented guides bringing the drama and tragedy of the protracted Anglo-Zulu wars of the late-1800s to life.So now, the choice is yours. Battles? The Big Five? Beaches? Bunny chow? One thing’s for certain, Durban is no longer second fiddle when it comes to cosmopolitan coastal escapes in South Africa.How to bookWith direct flights from London Heathrow to Durban, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

The meandering drive – stretching more than 120 miles from Mossel Bay in the west, to Storms River in the east – takes in dappled forests, still lakes and surf-pummeled beaches. It’s best explored on four wheels, but be sure to take your time. British Airways flies direct to Cape Town, where you can pick up an Avis hire car, belt up and settle into a truly picturesque ride.Humpback whales can often be spotted breaching clear out of the water at Hermanus, just a 90-minute drive from Cape Town. You can even spot whales lolling metres from the shoreline – keep your ears primed for the huff of a humpback whale exhaling right by your feet. The town hosts an annual whale festival each September – when huge southern right whales pass by in large numbers – and there’s even a whale crier, who alerts crowds to the presence of the animals by blowing on a kelp horn. July to October is a great time to see pods of migrating mothers with their calves and, if you’re feeling languid, the Marine Hotel is perfectly situated on a clifftop overlooking the ocean, so you’ll be able to spot barnacle-clad beasts from your balcony.A 40-minute trundle down the road, you’ll find Gansbaai. Known by locals as the Serengeti of the sea, the waters here are bristling with sea creatures, including the marine big five: whales, dolphins, seals, penguins and sharks. The latter can be seen in their menacing masses in Shark Alley – a sliver of ocean that roils with cape fur seals, the great white’s favourite prey.It’s a four-hour journey from Gansbaai to Oudtshoorn, but you’ll have plenty of screensaver scenery to gawp at along the way, including the craggy Tradouw mountain pass and the twisty-turny Huisrivier pass, which clings to the side of a mountain where cape leopards still roam. As well as the Cango Caves – an impressive prehistoric limestone system, dripping with troll-like rock formations, stalagmites and stalactites – Oudtshoorn boasts the largest number of ostriches in the world, with many of the farms offering tractor rides or walks out in the fields with the colossal birds.Head almost due south towards the coast and you’ll soon reach Knysna – a charming holiday town right at the heart of the Garden Route. Here, you’ll find a vast aquamarine lagoon spilling out into the ocean from between two huge sandstone headlands, helpfully known as the Heads. Hike through the lush forest – thought of as the lungs of this beautiful town – or take a trip out on to the water where you can fish, kayak, water ski and swim.A half-hour drive east is Plettenberg Bay. Home to the rocky Robberg Nature Reserve – where you can snorkel with rambunctious seals – a satisfyingly sandy central beach and the Nelson Bay caves, which date back to the stone age. This is also a great place to take part in a township tour (run by Ocean Blue Adventures). Meet up with a local from the Qolweni community and join them on a visit to the township’s Siyakhula crèche, the central shebeen and other lively spots, meeting some of the friendly locals and learning about the township’s rich history along the way. Come evening, stay at the remarkable Tsala Treetop Lodge just out of town – a collection of elegant elevated hideaways decked out in Afro-baroque style and hidden among the canopy of the ancient indigenous forest.Locals like to call Tsitsikamma, just north of Storms River – “the garden of the Garden Route”. An old Khoisan word, Tsitsikamma means “place of much water”, and whether it’s the yawning river valleys, the flinty ocean or the dew-daubed forest that clings to the mountains, this place is most certainly lush. Don your hiking boots for a lung-cleansing hike around this beautiful landscape, then make your final drive to Storms River, where – if the mood strikes – you can mark the end of your epic road trip by hurling yourself off the Bloukrans Bridge – the world’s highest bridge to bungee off.How to bookWith direct flights from London to Cape Town, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

The Office for Students in England recently set ambitious targets for wider access. But a team at the UCL Institute of Education say their research, published by the Centre for Economic Performance, throws into question whether simply getting poor students into university is enough.They examined the “quality match” between students and the courses they attend, using data on a cohort who enrolled in university in 2008. A student was considered well-matched if they had similar A-level scores to others on their course.They were deemed under-matched if they attended a course where fellow students had lower grades – suggesting they could have attended a more academically prestigious course and over-matched if other students on the course had gained higher grades than they had.“It could well be that students from disadvantaged backgrounds might not feel that they fit in at more prestigious places,” said Gill Wyness, professor of economics, who led the research.She added that multiple factors could be at work. There has been speculation that poorer students might tend to pick the closest university to home to save money. But Wyness said the research suggested the picture was more complicated than that.“You’re much more likely to go to your local university if you are from a poorer background. But if you look at all the students who go to a university that is near them, the disadvantaged kids will still go to a lower-quality university than the advantaged kids. Take London, for example, the rich kids will go to the Russell Group, they’ll go to UCL, and the poorer kids will go to South Bank. Geography doesn’t seem to be the driver of mismatch – the poorer students are still going to lower-quality universities.”Wyness said this suggested poorer students would benefit from more outreach work from high-ranking universities.She cited the example of No 10’s behavioural insights team, also known as nudge unit, which conducted an experiment The team also found female students attended courses with lower future average earnings than men, something the researchers said had implications for closing the gender pay gap."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec700c05f0031f8810a8df9199b42cd50639f63b/0_270_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc3969c7440d462af6d0669b9a33925f","title":"call for all toiletries to carry recycling information","story":"Which? urges toiletry makers to label products with clear instructions on disposal of plastic bottlesThe battle against plastic waste is being hindered by the poor information given to consumers about which product bottles can be recycled, a leading consumer group has warned.An analysis by Which? of labels on 20 common toiletries found the majority had no recycling information, despite most being at least partially recyclable. Only six had accurate and detailed labelling, telling users the bottles could be recycled, with specific instructions on how to do so.The analysis found that Head and Shoulders classic clean shampoo (500ml), L’Oreal Elvive Colour Protect conditioner (400ml) and Listerine Total Care mouthwash (500ml) had no clear recycling labels, despite being made of recyclable materials.While many brands fell short of the standards that the consumer rights champion expected, Carex’s Complete Original handwash (250ml) clearly displayed information about how to recycle the bottle which also encourages customers to do so. Radox Feel Refreshed shower gel (250ml) was picked out for similar praise.Recycling is well established in kitchen and grocery products, with Tesco announcing last week that it was removing shrink-wrapped multipacks of baked beans, soup and tuna from its supermarkets as part of a drive to reduce its use of plastic.Which? said the onus was now on leading brands to make significant changes to the way they approach the production of packaging and how they communicate with their customers.

In 2017, almost 2 billion animals were exported in a trade worth $21bn (£15bn), with a significant proportion travelling by sea.But most of the ships are old car carriers or other former cargo ships, rather than purpose-built vessels that can meet higher standards of animal welfare, said Wellard, one of the world’s largest livestock exporters, based in Australia.This week the ’s\u0026nbspAnimals Farmed\u0026nbspseries is focusing on the global live animal export trade, which, despite welfare and disease concerns, has\u0026nbspquadrupled over the last fifty years.Nearly 2 billion animals a year are loaded onto trucks or ships and sent off to new countries on journeys that can take weeks.\u0026nbspEvery day at least 5 million creatures are in transit, in a secretive global trade in live farm animals.\u0026nbspAnd those numbers are just the cross-border journeys. They do not include long journeys within countries, which are becoming more frequent due to a trend that has seen smaller slaughterhouses close down.We’re taking a moment to focus on some of the implications of\u0026nbspthis global trade.\u0026nbspA spokesperson for the company, which shipped nearly 400,000 cattle in 2019, said: “The old converted vessels bring the standard of the whole industry down. If you’re using a ship that was originally built for another purpose, you’re compromising on your animal services when you convert it to a livestock vessel.“The biggest threat to the global live export industry is old ships. They have inferior standards and livestock services and they are more prone to accidents and breakdowns. Those ships give a bad name to a legitimate industry.”More than half of the 129 livestock carriers listed as active with a working automated tracking system on at least one marine website were built before the 1980s. “The livestock carrier fleet is one of the oldest sectors in the globally trading fleet with an average vessel age of 38 years old,” said Adam Kent, managing director of market analysts Maritime Strategies International (MSI). In comparison, the average age of a container ship is 13.“Only the Laker fleet, trading on the freshwater Great Lakes, has an older average age,” he said.Livestock Express managing director Paul Pistorius warned that converting old vessels into livestock carriers means making “compromises”.“When converting a vessel, you must live with the original hull and machinery and furthermore you always need to make compromises during the conversion phase. History has shown that these compromises may lead to poor animal welfare outcomes.“There are indeed a lot of old conversions and also recent conversions of old hulls. Unfortunately, many of these vessels don’t always meet the standards to which we believe livestock carriers should adhere,” he said.The practice of transporting thousands of live animals (some ships carry more than 10,000 animals) across the sea for weeks at a time means attention must be paid to the welfare of animals. Older ships were not built for this purpose, which raises concerns.In November the Queen Hind, a 40-year-old vessel owned by Romanian company MGM Marine, was carrying more than 14,000 sheep when it capsized en route from Romania. The 22 crew members were rescued but just 180 sheep survived.Campaign groups said at the time that a major problem was that often vessels were not built for the journey. “They are old vessels that are converted to transport animals,” Francesca Porta from Eurogroup for Animals in Brussels told the New York Times.That incident prompted Nautilus International to call for an investigation into converted livestock carriers, saying the industry must “learn safety lessons for keeping seafarers safe and improving animal welfare”.“There’s a risk that in these long-distance transport there are major problems with animals overheating in highly humid, dirty conditions … where a vessel has been converted it will be less able to control bad conditions,” said a spokesperson from Compassion in World Farming.Simpson said the mortality rates were likely to be higher in other regions not reporting figures. “The ships I was on 10 years ago carried 10,000 cattle for 20-day voyages and if you lost 15 animals I would say that was average. When they were travelling out of South America, the crew told me the same ships would have 14,000 cattle and would lose 300–500 animals in a voyage.“They don’t care about animal welfare. It is just about numbers, which would be fine if we were talking about cans of soup.”A large number of livestock-carrying ships are also sailing under flags of convenience with poor reputations for ship safety. Out of the 129 ships listed as active, 52 are flying flags from countries currently blacklisted by the port inspection body the Paris MOU, which conducts more than 17,000 inspections on ships every year in ports around the world.In addition, 10 of the companies that own or manage converted vessels built before 1975 are listed as “low or very low-performing” by the European Maritime Shipping Agency.

But for the directors of the documentary On the Record, gaining worldwide traction wasn’t cause for celebration. It was something close to disaster.The film, which details accusations of sexual misconduct and assault by music mogul Richard Simmons, initially seemed to have everything: a topical subject matter, the Oscar-nominated producer-director team of Amy Ziering and Kirby Dick, intimate access, a splashy outlet in the shape of Apple TV+ and, most importantly, an executive producer by the name of Oprah Winfrey. It was set to be the most widely accessible documentary on #MeToo in music at a time when the industry is slowly catching up to the reckoning that’s taken place in the film world since the fall of Harvey Weinstein.Then on 10 January, things fell apart.In a shock move, Winfrey pulled her support and credit for the film, taking its Apple distribution deal with her. At the time, she released a statement saying that there was “more work to be done on the film to illuminate the full scope of what the victims endured” and that she didn’t align herself with the “creative vision” of Ziering and Dick. The film-makers have stood by the film, as has Sundance, and on Saturday, it premiered in the hope of finding a distributor in the process.It tells the story of A\u0026ampR executive Drew Dixon primarily but also of the other women who decided to come forward with their allegations of harassment and rape at the hands of Simmons, the co-founder of Def Jam, referred to in the film as “the godfather” of hip-hop.Dixon is more than just a talking head, she’s a fully fledged protagonist captured at every stage of a gruelling process from figuring out whether or not she wants to come forward, to dealing with journalists at the New York Times who would ultimately help tell her story, to processing the aftereffects. It’s a piercing portrait of what happens to someone when they go through not only the abuse itself but the complicated emotional journey in the years and decades after.“I do not want to be radioactive,” Dixon says in the film as she mulls over the potential fallout from coming forward.Dixon was a rare talent in the hip-hop scene of the mid-90s working her way up to her dream job at Def Jam through tenacity and drive but mostly, an undiluted love and an expertly trained ear for the music. In the film she talks about her early days of befriending the Notorious BIG (“Biggie had my back”) and helping to assemble Method Man and Mary J Blige’s 1995 hit You’re All I Need to Get By. She was a rising star in her early 20s working for a man who was “like a god” in the industry at the time. Simmons took her under his wing, a position that soon lost its luster when Simmons allegedly pulled her into a closet and tried to kiss her. She resisted his ongoing advances as politely as she knew she had to, given his position, but he increased his pursuit, allegedly exposing himself in her office soon after.Dixon refers to him as a “tragic ADD puppy dog that I had to keep retraining”, a depressingly inevitable part of the job for women in many industries and one that the doc frames as something reflected in the kind of music Dixon was working on. Hip-hop is described as “misogyny over dope beats” but the film also makes sure to remind us that it’s prevalent in all genres, using lyrics from Tom Jones and Mick Jagger among others to show a casual sexism that’s existed throughout the history of music. (“That language set a tone,” someone says.)It was in 1995 that life at Def Jam turned from degrading to wholly destructive. Dixon alleges that, after attending a party, Simmons offered to book her a car from his nearby apartment. It was the first time she was there with him alone and she suggested that waiting downstairs might be a wiser option. But he wanted her to listen to a demo. She offered to take the demo home and he asked her to remove it from a CD player in his bedroom. As she tried to figure out his hi-fi system, he emerged naked wearing a condom. “He just grabbed me and wrestled me to the bed,” she recalls.She protested but was overpowered and remembers him telling her to “stop fighting” in a tone that was unfamiliar to her: “cold, menacing, detached”. Then she claims that he raped her.“I was reduced to nothing in that moment,” she says. “I was trash … a physical device.”Simmons allegedly thought this meant they now had a different relationship and told her they could now have sex regularly. In a meeting that week he asked her to sit on his lap. “He thinks I’m that person now,” Dixon says of the moment.He has vehemently denied Dixon’s claim as well as the many other claims that came out as well. “These horrific accusations have shocked me to my core and all of my relations have been consensual,” he said in a statement. “I will relentlessly fight against any untruthful character assassination that paints me as a man of violence.”After the alleged incident, Dixon left Def Jam and found a job at Arista where she continued her professional success under Clive Davis, working on two Grammy-winning albums in a row from Lauryn Hill and Santana. But when Davis left, his replacement LA Reid allegedly brought back the sort of toxic environment she’d hoped was left in her past. She claimed there was a “quid pro quo” environment where she was being sexualised and when she would turn down his overtures, he became “meaner and meaner”.Dixon arranged an audition with a young, unsigned Kanye West who Reid referred to as “a waste of my time” while dressing her down in front of the office and with West within earshot. He then refused to attend a special performance she had set up with a similarly fresh-faced John Legend. She felt “doomed” and “dead in the water”.Her music career ended before it had the chance to continue to flourish and she left the industry. “We all lose when brilliant women go away,” a voice in the documentary states.In response, Reid’s statement read: “I’m proud of my track record promoting, supporting and uplifting women at every company I’ve ever run. That notwithstanding, if I have ever said anything capable of being misinterpreted, I apologize unreservedly.” He left his job at Epic Records in 2017 after an accusation of sexual harassment.Dixon’s isn’t the only story shared in the documentary. Other women have come forward with stories of rape and sexual misconduct and we also hear their claims. “He just took, took, took what he wanted,” says musician Sheri Sher who alleges that Simmons assaulted her.The documentary also adds important context not only with regards to the dangers faced by women in the music industry but the difficulty many women of colour face coming forward. There’s a nuanced discussion related to the guilt many black women often feel when accusing black men of sexual assault and how this makes them feel like traitors, feeding into a system that has forever hypersexualised and punished them. “I didn’t want to let the culture down,” says Dixon.It’s a strong, emotive, substantive piece of work and one that largely relays testimonies that had already been vetted and legalled by the New York Times. So there remains a number of questions surrounding Winfrey’s very public departure as well as anguish from the women involved and the community at large. An open letter has been assembled by survivors of sexual misconduct and advocates, including Gloria Steinem, Marisa Tomei, Rosanna Arquette, Alyssa Milano and Thandie Newton, to show support. “We want them to know: We believe you. We hear you. You deserve to be seen,” it reads.Winfrey has admitted that Simmons tried to pressure her into dropping the film but has denied that this affected her decision and earlier this week, she appeared on CBS to restate this. “This is not a victory for Russell,” she said. “I did not pull out because of Russell … I cannot be silenced by Russell Simmons after all I’ve been through.”Instead she claims that she told the film-makers there were inconsistencies and she wanted them to add a wider context to the story while also standing by the women featured. The New York Times reported that Winfrey apparently sent a copy of the film to director Ava DuVernay who replied with “harsh” criticism. But as yet, there’s been no real elaboration which leaves a worrying dark cloud over a film with an important message.“It was very disappointing and upsetting,” said producer Ziering. “We were concerned about the survivors and what the hell this is going to do to them.”According to a piece in the Hollywood Reporter this week, the survivors have been going through what Dixon refers to as a “hellscape” with another accuser, the model turned domestic violence activist Sil Lai Abrams needing guidance from a trauma specialist.“I feel like I’m experiencing a second crime,” Dixon said. “I am being silenced. The broader community is being intimidated. The most powerful black woman in the world is being intimidated.”As it premieres, On the Record hopes not only to find distribution but to course correct its journey and reiterate its intention to bring light to the stories of women who not only want to be heard, but want to be believed as well."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b2adba9f0dd73bfd3bf937fc7bd7d17840097c0/53_0_1032_619/master/1032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2db6149c1ca787e287b71f9f38a4390b","title":"shirley review elisabeth moss literary psychodrama","story":"A perversely entertaining take on a brief period of Shirley Jackson’s life gives the star one of her most daring roles to dateAs willfully unconventional as a literary portrait could possibly be, Madeline’s Madeline director Josephine Decker’s take on Shirley Jackson is a thrillingly perverse example of what happens when the shackles of biopic formula are cast aside. Based on Shirley: A Novel, the acclaimed book from Susan Scarf Merrell, Shirley tells of a fictitious dynamic, an imagined period where a younger couple moved in with Jackson and her husband, but weaves in known details about the reclusive horror writer’s life and personality. It’s a strange construction but one that feels fitting given what we know of her, a woman who found reality and the rules that came with it to be rather pedestrian. It’s as unusual a film as she was an author and one imagines she’d get a devious kick out of the dark places the film takes us to.Elisabeth Moss, an actor who can seemingly do anything at this stage of her career, is Shirley, still receiving both praise and disgust from those around her for The Lottery, a widely read short story about small town savagery published in the New Yorker. She lives with her husband Stanley (Michael Stuhlbarg), a controlling bon vivant who both amuses and annoys but he cares for her when she’s in one of her many downward spirals, refusing to leave the house for months on end. Their rocky relationship is complicated further when Stanley’s new teaching assistant Fred (Logan Lerman) and wife Rose (Odessa Young), move into their home for a short period. Shirley is displeased with their presence but soon becomes fascinated with Rose, recognising a shared affinity for the macabre.There are obvious echoes of Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? here as we watch an older couple rip into both each other and their younger houseguests but Decker is interested in expanding her focus beyond regurgitating insults. In the opening scene we see Rose finish reading The Lottery on a train journey to the house and rather than express repulsion, she’s oddly aroused and immediately takes her husband to the toilet to have frantic sex. Her initial attempts to charm Shirley are indelicately batted away but the pair slowly figure out a rhythm with the author teasing out a strangeness that Rose had been keeping under wraps while playing the role of a polite wife. Both women are living in a period, the late 50s, of restrictive gender expectations and under Shirley’s informal tutelage, Rose experiences a radical awakening.But there’s a tragedy in Rose’s transformation for Shirley because even though in many ways, she has given up on performing the role of a subservient wife, she’s stuck with a boorish showboating husband who abuses their open marriage with endless local dalliances regardless of any embarrassment it might cause her. He’s also a drain on her financially and an insufferably self-serving critic of her work. There’s an understandably dour view of men at the time, especially those working in academia and how they see their wives. While Shirley might break convention around others, she finds it harder around Stanley, shown quite beautifully in a scene near the end as she nervously awaits his verdict on her new book. By taking care of her, he’s also stifling the woman she is, a difficult dynamic that’s fascinating for us to watch.There’s a hypnotic perversity to the characters and how they interact, never meeting our expectations and Decker’s direction is equally peculiar and unpredictable. It’s essentially a one-location film with what appears to be mostly natural lighting and through often brutal sound design and a suffocatingly sustained atmosphere, we’re trapped with the foursome as they push and pull at each other. It’s an uncomfortable film, designed to provoke and prod, but it’s richly rewarding, thanks in great part to some superlative performances. Moss, who has been hemmed in of late with the repetitive nature of The Handmaid’s Tale, is on fine form here, arguably the best we’ve seen from her, recalling the mania of Her Smell but with a tighter control over her character’s excesses. She’s utterly transfixing as she tears into those around her but Moss never loses sight of Shirley’s vulnerability, a character who’s never one thing or the other, compelling to watch unfold as she oscillates between sweet and sour. There’s also a believably odious turn from Stuhlbarg, selling the couple’s toxic chemistry while Young is fearlessly able to match the pair with probably the toughest role in the film, descending with them in order to ultimately ascend with her own agency.There’s a lot here to digest, a bitter cocktail with many confounding flavours and its abrasiveness will prove tough-going for some, especially those in search of a more polite and familiarly structured literary biopic. But for those willing to sink into the depths with Shirley, it’s a delicious journey down."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fc1dd1be03134b2332cc8c90602deb5f2732448/0_77_3479_2088/master/3479.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2183b3376e19c41e61a78102808dbfc","title":"marieanne spacey cale southampton fa cup coventry womens football","story":"Manager hopeful that FA Cup tie against Championship side Coventry United will provide a taste of the big timeWhen fourth-tier Southampton FC welcome Championship side Coventry United to St Mary’s in the FA Cup on Sunday they will get a taste of the professionalism they are aiming for. “This challenge is a huge part of our learning,” says their manager, Marieanne Spacey-Cale. “The physicality of a Super League or Championship team gives us a chance to test where we are. It’s an opportunity to feel it, to smell it, to taste it. What would it look like if that was us every Sunday?”In 2018 the FA opened bidding for places in the fully professional Women’s Super League and semi-professional Championship, and there were hopes that the chance to jump in towards the top would prompt big clubs, and specifically Manchester United, to join the increasingly profitable and marketable game.Like United, Southampton had scrapped their women’s team in 2005, though in their case it coincided with the relegation of the men’s team from the Premier League. Both relaunched a senior side for the 2018-19 season and bid for the Championship. United were granted a licence by the FA that meant they flew straight into the second tier. But Southampton missed out.Some speculated over whether the will to stick to their club’s launch would still be there should they have to climb from the fifth tier, but just after they were deemed to have not met the entry criteria for the Championship, they appointed the former England international Spacey-Cale as manager. Poaching the 91-capped forward from the FA was a statement move.“When I came in we had just lost the opportunity for a licence,” she says. “The club did appeal, but they were straight away saying that whatever happens we want to have this programme, we want a successful women’s team as part of Southampton football club.” Like United, in their first season Southampton FC won promotion – and they are on course for another, as they are unbeaten in the National League Division One, South West. “For me, there was never any scepticism and even if there was then that’s certainly in the past, because what the club has done shows how much they support what we want to achieve here,” Spacey-Cale says of the perception that some clubs may be frustrated at their entry as big-spenders in the lower leagues.“Other clubs have gone through this. When there wasn’t a lot of money for the women’s game, other clubs have shut down teams and now they’re coming back. Charlton are back in the Championship, Fulham have a team again, Man United did, and are now in the WSL.“It’s a situation that you can’t control but you can look to the future and be positive about it. There’s an appetite for the women’s game now and we want to be a part of that now and for the future.”On arrival, Spacey-Cale was given a “blank piece of paper” to mould Southampton FC’s new programme. “I’m a very positive person so if I didn’t believe we had an opportunity to climb through the leagues then I might not be sitting here today,” says the 53-year-old. “We’ve got a young squad, a tier one Regional Talent Club that is transitioning players through from the under-16s to the development squad and some into the first team, so we’ve got real clear pathways and not having a Championship licence has given us the opportunity to build that.“Now we’ve got a real sustainable pathway fully supported by the club that says that you can come into Southampton as a nine-year-old and hopefully one day be playing in the Super League.”Continuing their FA Cup run would be a bonus, but the focus is on the league and getting to a position where they, like Coventry United and other tier one and two clubs, are entering at the fourth round instead of battling their way to it. “Tier three we’ve played and beaten in the last couple of rounds. We want to feel that every week next year, so promotion is key. And now we’ve got an opportunity to go up a level and play a team that got promoted out of that last year.”Closest to Southampton FC in the league, confusingly, are another Southampton team – Southampton Women’s FC, who are eight-times FA Cup winners and have also reached the last 32 of the competition. They play against the Championship side Crystal Palace on Sunday.“What’s great is that the two teams from Southampton are showing what Hampshire is all about,” says Spacey-Cale diplomatically. “It’s a fantastic hotbed of talent for women’s football. Our aim is to be promoted, and to do that we have to win the league. It’s one team that goes up, so that’s our aim.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8b1dfea76eb597712b6c8bde3b35176cabc5eda/0_134_2717_1630/master/2717.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f2bf317a8b92b78d97529c45c375172","title":"arsenal west ham womens fa cup match report","story":"Arsenal bounced back from their heavy defeat Chelsea last weekend with an efficient FA Cup fourth-round defeat of last year’s runners-up West Ham.A stunning side-footed volley from Lia Wälti and a first-half goal from Katie McCabe fensured the Gunners remain in the hunt in four competitions and for a 15th FA Cup title.The second all-WSL tie of the FA Cup fourth round should have been routine for Arsenal, but West Ham have always tested Joe Montemurro’s free-flowing side. Their three league meetings since the Hammers launched a women’s team and entered the top tier may have gone Arsenal’s way, but they have all been close – 4-3, 4-2 and, most recently, 2-1 in September 2019.For this tie, despite patchy form that has produced only seven wins in their 15 games since that defeat, and none back to back, Matt Beard’s team seemed to raise their game. The opening exchanges suggested this encounter would be no different. Beard opted for three centre backs with the England Under-20 captain, Grace Fisk, who joined in December, slotting in alongside Gilly Flaherty and Katharina Baunach and, with his wing-backs dropping into a back five whenever Arsenal pressed forward, they were effective at closing off space at the back.For the visiting team this game had the added importance of following their bruising 4-1 home defeat to title rivals Chelsea in the WSL. Lose and they would go into back-to-back games against Manchester City in the League Cup and WSL having suffered consecutive competitive defeats for the first time in 20 months.Any nerves though were settled early on. With the Arsenal super-fan Maria going solo in her jovial chanting battle with the home crowd, the Gunners put pressure on the tight West Ham lines.Just shy of the 20-minute mark they were one up after Kim Little raced into the box, looked around and laid the ball back to McCabe who cut inside from the left and lashed into the top corner.Montemurro had relegated the wide players Lisa Evans and Beth Mead to the bench and pushed McCabe back into defence against Chelsea, sacrificing their potent width as they attempted to dominate in the middle, and it proved costly.At a freezing Rush Green, restored to the starting XI and their more natural berths the impact was clear with McCabe and Mead linking well, the former swinging the ball to the latter at the back post but her side-footed volley was over.West Ham weren’t without chances of their own, Kenza Dali’s powerful cross with just a little too much in it for Julia Simic to be able to direct her header on target.Absorbing a spell of West Ham pressure around the hour mark, Dali collecting a clearance on the edge of the box and swiping narrowly over for their best effort, Arsenal looked dangerous with every break. The England forward Mead forced a fine low save from Courtney Brosnan and punished the Hammers for not capitalising on their period of possession with a pinpoint delivery from a corner that Wälti beautifully side-footed in on the volley with 17 minutes to play for her first Arsenal goal.Fisk and Brosnan undid fine performances with the latter collecting Fisk’s backpass which she had slipped away from the feet of Vivianne Miedema, but the Dutch striker, who has yet to score this calendar year, saw her powerful effort cleared off the line."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/689a98aee91aee9d8e568509b709b46d310d6e2b/154_124_2721_1632/master/2721.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1f4fbc7be7aae018b832420f101ca7a","title":"manchester city fulham fa cup fourth round match report","story":"This was Manchester City’s 19th straight win in domestic cup competition, the holders coasting into the fifth round in a tie that neared a soporific state at times.Pep Guardiola and his team will not care, of course. They are favourites to reach Wembley again this week when facing Manchester United here in Wednesday’s EFL Cup semi-final second leg and it may be unwise to bet against them reaching the FA Cup showpiece again this year.Guardiola had plumped for Claudio Bravo not Ederson as his goalkeeper, gave Phil Foden a start in a wide left berth and retained Gabriel Jesus as the No 9 ahead of Sergio Aguero, the XI showing eight changes from Tuesday’s win at Sheffield United.And, within six minutes of kick-off, the manager was without Tim Ream. This was because when the captain pulled Gabriel Jesus over in the area, Kevin Friend pointed to the spot and showed Ream a red card: double jeopardy activated as he had not tried to play the ball. Ilkay Gundogan beat Marek Rodak to give City a dream start and a nightmare one for their visitors.Playing Guardiola’s team with 11 men can be close to impossible, having only 10 the definition of a nightmare: Parker’s reshuffle had Joe Bryan moving from left midfield to left-back, and Terence Kongolo moving across into central defence.Riyad Mahrez was next to torment Fulham via some nifty footwork that ended with him letting fly at Rodak, who saved to his right. Bernardo Silva now got in on the soft-shoe shuffle act, and this time he doubled the lead.From the edge of the area the Portuguese became a one-man carousel spinning a group of Fulham defenders with him, finally turning a last time inside and leaving Ivan Cavaleiro gawping as he rifled home a sublime strike.The contest seemed already over – any remaining intrigue concerned how many City might score. Guardiola’s men toyed with their opponents, dialling up quality at will, as when Riyad Mahrez glided past Bryan, who chopped the Algerian down. Bryan was lucky not to be booked and when Friend blew for the break Fulham could be heartened by having not conceded again. A measure of the one-way traffic, though, was found in the Cottagers having had three touches in City’s area. The tally for Guardiola’s men had been near-countless.They began the second half with another spurned chance. Angelino traded passes with Foden, then found David Silva inside the area. The captain relayed the ball to Mahrez yet from an inviting angle he blasted high.It had Guardiola grimacing and Mahrez was replaced on 52 minutes by Raheem Sterling: whether this was related was unclear.There was no doubt City should have been further ahead at this juncture.Sterling’s first contribution had Guardiola bowing his head: a dribble into Bobby Decordova-Reid that meant an attack fizzled out.The winger registered the last of his 19 goals this season a month ago. When he pounced on a powder-puff Fulham clearance, number 20 seemed inevitable but Sterling saw his shot clip the frame and miss.Against a backdrop more akin to a summer warm-up game, Fulham’s brightest moment arrived via a free-kick in an advanced position. Stefan Johansen floated the ball in but Cavaleiro bumped into Bernardo Silva and though Parker protested Friend adjudged no foul play.City continued to probe. Nicolás Otamendi rolled the ball to Foden, it went to Gundogan, David Silva and, once more, they could not capitalise. Then, at last, they did. This was simple and derived from Fulham again trying to play out from the back. Decordova-Reid was caught out close to goal, the ball went to João Cancelo, and Jesus nodded home.Farcically Fulham conceded via precisely the same slipshod manner seconds later. Michael Hector was dispossessed by Jesus in front of Rodak and the subsequent sequence ended with the Brazilian finishing after the keeper beat Foden’s effort out.Now ended Decordova-Reid’s afternoon, Parker introducing Denis Odoi for him. Yet the manager, really, might have acted more effectively by ordering his team earlier in the half to forget trying to start attacks from the back and so stop City’s high press mugging them.By the final whistle this was as easy an outing as City could have hoped for. Next up is Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s beleaguered United."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8cf2b6ac66b55a6668f50eb463c43e9950ca2c6/17_0_3388_2034/master/3388.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01b6a28f916001b1bdb3badf1342437e","title":"manchester city v fulham fa cup fourth round live","story":"An early red card for Fulham’s Tim Ream restricted the visitors to damage limitation - and Gabriel Jesus’s second-half double sealed an emphatic win for the FA Cup holdersAnd that’s all from me. It was over before it began, really - once Fulham went down to 10 men it was a matter of how many Manchester City would score. In the end, the answer was four. Fulham did well to restrict them to that scoreline, but were also responsible for making errors that led to the goals. So Manchester City march onwards, into the fifth round, still battling for glory in the FA Cup, Carabao Cup and Champions League this season. Thank you for reading  emailing in, and see you next time. Bye for now.Here’s Jamie Jackson’s match report from the Etihad:Speaking of Manchester United, Ashley Young popped up with an assist on his debut for Inter Milan in their 1-1 draw against Cagliari: So, no upset for Fulham at Man City. How about Tranmere against Manchester United? Oh, now you’re talking! It’s just kicked off -Man City’s David Silva: “We played well. Hopefully we can win more titles this year. Foden has got a bright future.”Phil Foden: “I thought we played really well today, it was a shame they got a red card because it killed the game a bit, but it’s good to get the job done.”Textbook post-match interviews to go with a textbook performance, really.Richards on Fulham’s errors: “Sometimes you’ve just got to kick the ball long, squeeze up, and get the second balls.”You can tell he left City before Guardiola turned up, can’t you? You won’t find ‘kicking it long and getting second balls’ in the Book of Pep.He’s right about Fulham though, of course. They over-complicated life for themselves today by trying to play out from the back too often. That led, directly, to two of the goals. Those are not the kind of mistakes you can afford to be making when you play at Manchester City.The FA Cup holders are into the fifth round. The managers, Pep Guardiola and Scott Parker, share a few friendly words on the touchline. Once the visitors went down to 10, with that sending-off for Tim Ream inside the first 10 minutes, it really was game over. Fulham acquitted themselves well for most of it, but a couple of errors crept in towards the end.90 min: This doesn’t look good Cancelo who has gone down under a stoppage-time challenge from Fulham’s Bryan. The City players immediately call for medical treatment. Cancelo looks in a lot of pain - on replay it seems Bryan accidentally raked a stud down the back of Cancelo’s heel. Bryan is booked. However, Cancelo is now sitting up and is looking OK. 90 min: Foden strikes a free-kick which hits the wall. The crowd has gone remarkably quiet. We are nearly into stoppage time.87 min: Cancelo feints to shoot right-footed, cuts on to his left, and hits a low shot harmlessly wide from the edge of the box. City’s attentions can turn to their midweek date with Manchester United now ... The fans will go home happy - although maybe even a touch disappointed that the early sending-off effectively ended the contest.86 min: Sterling runs on to a ball into the right-hand channel. Fulham deal with it well.85 min: Five minutes to go and City still search for more. Foden darts centrally, but loses control and the ball balloons to Rodak in the Fulham goal.83 min: Kongolo off for Fulham, Sylvester Jasper comes on for his debut.81 min: Parker is pictured on the touchline, his hands plunged into his pockets. He will be annoyed - Fulham errors have led directly to three of these four goals, counting Ream’s sending-off offence. It was mission impossible, but his players managed to make a whole lot more impossibler.79 min: City stream forward again. The floodgates are yawning open, and the visitors - no doubt tiring after playing the vast majority of this match with 10 men - are starting to struggle. More than 10 minutes for Manchester City to extend their lead.79 min: Fulham make another change - Odoi on, Reid off.And another! Fulham are the architects of their own downfall again, coughing up possession in their own penalty area of all places. Rodak makes a good save from an initial shot from close range - but Jesus follows up and nods in the fourth.Thumping header at the far post. VAR check ... but it stands. Kongolo got caught in possession in his own area, and City worked the ball back to Cancelo, who had time to whip in a fine cross to the far post. Jesus gets up well and powers a header beyond Kongolo. Meanwhile, John Stones and Rodri have come on, with Otamendi and Gundogan making way. 72 min: Cancelo tries to power past Bryan and get to the byline, on the right, but again it’s some very strong defending from Fulham. It’s a goal-kick.69 min: Fulham string together an impressive series of passes - in their own half - and the travelling support give it a few “Olés”.A lot of teams would have been five or six down by now. The Fulham fans, while not exactly thrilled to be 2-0 down, will be appreciating the current work of their 10 men.68 min: Scott Parker makes a change for Fulham. Ivan Cavaleiro off, Tom Cairney on. If Fulham draw this second half 0-0, that’s like a win, right?67 min: Angelino smacks a cross from the left, on the half-volley, which arrows over the cross bar and out of play - but not before giving Rodak a momentary scare in Fulham’s goal.66 min: Sterling plays in Foden on City’s right. Bryan challenges in the penalty area, Foden falls over, City want a penalty, but the referee says no. There is a VAR check, and they say no too.65 min: David Silva embarks on another mazy run into the heart of the Fulham defence. He has been excellent so far today. He’s relished having a bit of extra space and time in which to operate.63 min: Now Fulham get a free-kick in an advanced area but they make a mess of it. After sending a cross in from the right they appeal for another free-kick, on the edge of the City box, but the ref isn’t having it. A good chance passed up by Parker’s men, there.61 min: David Silva again is the creator, pinging a first-time ball which sends Jesus through one-on-one. Despite being behind Jesus, Kongolo es in with a brilliant last-ditch tackle, stealing the ball off the end of Jesus’s toe, just as the striker’s eyes were lighting up. Absolutely superb defending.60 min: Twice in the space of a minute, David Silva’s perceptiveness creates chances for team-mates. Jesus is offside for the first, and for the second Raheem Sterling slams a shot which cannons off the outside of the post and crossbar.58 min: Here’s City’s second goal thanks to BBC Sport’s Twitter:On the touchline, Man City boss Pep Guardiola is animated. He doesn’t look happy with the way Fulham are containing his team. It looks like he is asking for more from his attacking players.55 min: Manchester City continue to stroke the ball around pretty much at their leisure, but again, Fulham refuse to roll over. A cross is curled in for Jesus but Fulham manage to deal with it. Parker has sent his team out with a fresh determination. If they were to keep this to 2-0 or 3-0, that in itself would be a pretty remarkable effort.52 min: Raheem Sterling is readying himself to come on. And here he comes. Mahrez goes off. On commentary, Murphy speculates that Mahrez may be feeling the effects of that heavy challenge by Joe Bryan.Meanwhile, Fulham have started this half impressively, even if they are still under a lot of pressure. They’ve kept their defensive shape, and have passed the ball well considering the circumstances.50 min: City build slowly from the back. Space opens up for Jesus, who slides a pass to Mahrez, but Fulham deal with it well. It’s worked back to Cancelo, who shoots, and the hosts have a corner.49 min: David Wall emails: “Glad to see more of Micah Richards on pundit duty on the BBC for today’s match. He’s becoming a regular across their radio coverage in particular and I think has been one of the most enjoyable to listen to. Unlike some others he always seems able to keep his own achievements and ability in perspective, and to maintain a sense of humour about it all.”47 min: Lovely pass-and-move stuff from City down the left. It goes through Foden, Angelino and David Silva who ping the ball around at pace. Silva squares it, Mahrez shoots! But it’s over the bar.Let’s go! Manchester City get the ball rolling. No changes for either side.The BBC are currently sending a few LOLs in the direction of pundit Micah Richards, by replaying the time he swore on telly in an interview with Garth Crooks after scoring an FA Cup winner for Man City as a youngster.“How did I get a job at the BBC after that?” jokes Richards.And we’re back, with an email from Ike Proud, in response to Matt Dony’s pool-humiliation message:“My friend and I used to do something similar to humiliate each other on MarioKart - If either of us were far enough ahead in a race, we would stop on the finish line, turn around, and win the race in reverse. The ultimate humiliation. And super satisfying.”So hang on - does that mean if you cross the line in reverse in MarioKart, you still win if you’ve done enough laps? Well, that’s amazing.Paul Wilson on Shrewsbury v Liverpool:And on Tranmere v Man Utd:Both pundits saying Ream should have trusted his goalkeeper to come and collect that ball when Jesus appeared to be in. Maybe so. It all came from a classy dummy by David Silva. That made it a difficult decision for Ream, who was perhaps a bit unsettled by that earlier error. He got the decision wrong. The recriminations, if that is the right word, will no doubt be ongoing in the Fulham changing room right now.It was a terrible start for Tim Ream in the Fulham defence, when he gave the ball away in the first minute in his own penalty area. Somehow, it got worse, when he conceded a penalty for a pull on Gabriel Jesus and was sent off inside eight minutes. Gundogan stroked in the penalty and Bernardo Silva made it two. It’s game over, isn’t it? We’ll see if Fulham can make any inroads in the second half but I don’t fancy their chances.45 min: We will have a solitary minute of added time. Man City stream forward. Angelino fires a low cross towards Jesus. Fulham clear for a corner, which Sessegnon clears, and that’s half-time.43 min: Fulham are in City’s half! Johansen pumps a long free-kick into the City box, where Hector tries to take it down, but he’s crowded out by defenders.There’s a lingering shot of a young fan eating some crisps. Not an awful lot happening on the pitch just at the moment. Which is good news for Fulham, really.42 min: Man City attack, again. A cross is floated over from the City left. Johansen stops it, with his chestshoulder, and the City fans appeal en masse for a penalty.39 min: Matthew Dony emails: “In my younger days, when I spent more time than I’d care to remember playing pool in grotty pubs, there were few things more arrogant and mischievous (and, in all honesty, satisfying) than patronisingly offering to swap colours when you were comfortably ahead. Maybe City should offer to reverse the scoreline at half-time?”I used to enjoy the one where your opponent was on the black, and you put your cue back in the rack before they’d taken the shot, as if to say - “Game over.” This often seemed to have the desired effect of distracting them, and affording you another shot at glory. I am not sure what the footballing equivalent is for Fulham, though.35 min: Now Joe Bryan fouls Mahrez. Mahrez looks hurt - he was shifting on to his left, and sprinting over the halfway line, and was upended by Bryan’s outstretched leg. Substitute Raheem Sterling goes for a little run on the touchline. But Mahrez is OK.They just replayed the penalty  sending off incident from a different angle. It was a cute dummy by David Silva that saw the ball slide through to Jesus, just before Ream pulled him back.33 min: Johansen fouls David Silva, who I can tell you (even without referencing the official stats) is the most-fouled player in this match so far. The free-kick is belted over the bar by Mahrez.32 min: Fulham defend a corner well and then hack the ball upfield, into space, to nobody, just to relieve the pressure for a few precious seconds.“Afternoon Luke.

Report here:Early evidence suggests Harvey Elliott hasn’t changed his haircut, which is a shame. Helluva talent though – and ferociously direct. Golbourne will have his work cut out at left wing-back.After some pre-match reading? You’re in luck. Our man in the north-west sat down for a lovely chat with Shrewsbury’s Grenadian contingent. Have a gander: Just the 11 changes for Mr Klopp, then, although that rather underplays the strength of a side that contains two seasoned centre-halves, one thrilling new arrival, perhaps the Premier League’s best all-round midfielder, and at least two spectacularly promising teenage prodigies. As for Sam Ricketts, his wing-back Scott Golbourne has passed a late fitness test to make it into the XI and Blackburn loanee Sam Hart is on the bench ahead of a potential debut.They couldn’t, could they…? As the weeks tick by and the wins stack up, the vital question hanging over Liverpool’s season is becoming less about whether they can finally get their hands on That Trophy, and more about exactly which trophies they won’t get their hands on. It’s early days, of course, but Liverpool’s relentlessness is such that you could understand a rising anxiety at Old Trafford about the prospect of their Class of ‘99 finally being equalled, or similar feelings in north London regarding their fabled Invincibles. To do both at once – a supremely distant possibility, but a possibility nonetheless – well, that would leave both those history-makers in the dust.But first things first. Shrewsbury may be 59 places below Jürgen Klopp’s men but they’ve proven a tough nut to crack in this competition in recent seasons, taking Wolves to a replay last year and West Ham the year before that. And when Liverpool take to the field at New Meadow this afternoon, they will be up against a side they have lost just one of their last 17 FA Cup fixtures on home turf.A nice subplot here is that the match is of special interest to a tiny sunkissed island 4,000 miles away: Shrewsbury’s trio of Aaron Pierre, Omar Beckles and Oliver Norburn all represent the national team of Grenada (population 111,000 – or 114th of the county of Merseyside) with another prospective international, Ro-Shaun Williams, yet to commit. So plenty will be tuning in from the Caribbean to see how the world champions fare against Shrewsbury’s Spice Boys, as the Grenadian team is affectionately known.For Liverpool, that tag has rather different connotations: of lenient management, lax defending and chronic underachievement. That was also an era which saw the only other meeting between these clubs, a 4-0 win for Liverpool at Gay Meadow en route to the Spice Boys’ most ignominious hour. We’re a long way from all that now, though, and while another Wembley final is still some way off, should Liverpool get there this year we can be sure of one thing: they won’t be a cream suit in sight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dd0f6fdbb8670602416d9e8450263e826e06eda/525_92_2537_1522/master/2537.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a87b6ed781a8ad9a1a93bfd0df80d204","title":"tranmere rovers v manchester united fa cup fourth round live","story":"83 min: Shaw gets on the end of some link-up play but his left-foot shot is weak. 82 min: Hepburn-Murphy, spins inside and goes for a shot from outside the box. Just wide, with Romero scrabbling. He then creates a chance for Morris, whose shot is saved with some comfort by Romero. 80 min: Mullin and Hepburn-Murphy have been lively since coming on. Perhaps playing an unchanged team was something of an error, not enough to make a difference but Tranmere’s energy levels did not sustain beyond their opening salvo. Once Maguire scored they were spent up. 78 min: A foul on Connor Jennings forces a free-kick on the edge of the box for Tranmere. Mullin will take it, and he whacks that some way into the stands. It has not been their day.75 min: Ole has a grin on his face. Relief, for now at least. His team are playing some lovely stuff Lingard almost makes it seven by getting time and space and then drilling a shot off the base of the post. 73 min: Double Tranmere subbing: Blackett-Taylor for Hepburn-Murphy, and Paul Mullin, scorer of the winner v Watford, comes on for Ferrier.72 min: Dalot and Greenwood, two players with an eye on a first-team berth, have continued to take up the pace. They want more goals to prove their worth. 71 min: United, by the way, are cruising, but playing pretty patterns on the edge of the Tranmere box. Chong has a shot well saved by Davies, who you can’t even say has had a bad game, barring perhaps the penalty though he had little choice there.69 min: The Tranmere fans have been a credit, it has to be said. The United fans have been quiet in the second half, and some of them might be fancying a trip back across the Wirral.67 min: John Delaney, maybe not that John Delaney but then again it might be, has this to say: “I like the ‘Tequila’ chant, everyone should sack the game off and have a big old party! Some things are bigger than football... like getting hammered and dancing on tables.” 65 min: Subs: Off comes Perkins for Gilmour, with the veteran midfielder able to rest up after being given a frightful chasing. 65 min: Pereira tries to get in on the act but his shot spins wide. 64 min: Off comes Harry Maguire, which makes sense considering he has been playing with an injury. The captain got the game going with that opening goal. Williams comes on. 63 min: Brandon Williams is set to come on for United, and has been waiting on the sidelines. 61 min: By the way, the ever active Blackett-Taylor almost made something happen, only for the move to come to nothing. 58 min: The Tranmere song is to this piece of 60s kitsch.57 min: The Tranmere fans are now singing very loudly indeed. Now, what is that 60s kitsch song they are singing to. We all know it, but I can’t put my finger on it.Greenwood sends Davies the wrong way with a cool finish. 56 min: Penalty to Manchester United, as Greenwood sends Chong away, and Davies fouls the youngster. Yellow card for the keeper.55 min: “Please, please tell me that Mike Dean is there and the cameras have spotted him,” asks Gareth Rogers. Nothing like this so far.54 min: An unamused Micky Mellon looks like he has been sucking a lemon rather than a, well, melon on the sidelines. They dared to dream but this has been something of nightmare. 53 min: Luke Shaw, who actually did OK last week at Liverpool after some initial confusion, has looked decent on the left flank, though has been given plenty of space. 51 min: The Tranmere fans trying their best to get back into this, the noise from the early stages has abated. A drummer has taken up the cudgels and got the songs going.49 min: Early sight of Chong’s mane as he chases down a backpass to Tranmere goalie Davies, only for the City-supporting custodian to wallop clear.47 min: Greenwood, who ebbed from view as the rest of his team were plundering goals, crosses the ball and Dalot makes a mess of it. 46 min: Off goes Blackett-Taylor on one of the runs he made during those long-forgotten early stages. Two changes for Manchester United, and understandable, too. Tahith Chong and Fred come on for Anthony Martial and Nemanja Matic. Ole working out when to rest players? Harry Maguire surely worth a few minutes off, too. Important reporting from Sean Ingle. A correction on Jesse Lingard: that was his first goal in English football since January 25 2019 he also scored v Astana in the Europa League in November. There’s been a London derby in the Women’s FA Cup.That’s the same scoreline as 1976 but in half the time. Five great goals for United and Tranmere’s big day has been as muddied as Phil Jones’ shirt. Martial uses Morris as a screen and lays up an unerring finish.43 min: At this point, would it suit both teams to just give up on this. Sir Alex is in the stands and laughing away with a pal. 42 min: This is a test for Tranmere...no, it’s over. Micky Mellon looks utterly downcast. United have had four attempts on target and each has resulted in a goal.Pereira takes the corner and Phil Jones heads in. And what a broad smile he greets that with. 39 min: A long session of possession play from United, with Tranmere trying desperately to hold their shape. Matic wins a corner.38 min: Harry Maguire seems to be enjoying his chances to bring the ball out of defence in an old-style libero fashion. He is being given space to do so. Lingard also enjoying himself in finding space. He forces a corner. 36 min: Tranmere look a little weary. United look full of running and passing. 34 min: And the United fans are singing the name of their manager and lustily so. Recent service resumed from Jesse Lingard as he makes a mess of a cross from Luke Shaw, who is playing as a line-hugging left winger. Martial makes a claim for a penalty when he and Clarke collide but the referee Lee Mason will not have a bar of that. 32 min: Mary Waltz takes to the floor: “Is United “in chaos?’ Maybe not. They are in denial. Good news for Ole ripping apart Tranmere but this win doesn’t mean they can skip this transfer period and go with what they have now. Even if they overpay for a midfielder and a striker they can make their money back by getting into the Champions League.”31 min: On with the football, where Tranmere are pushing up a bit, and having a go without really looking too convinced that they can get back into this game.30 min: Daire Finnie emails in: “That ‘found their level’ remark ..An excellent two-footed tackle, winning the ball cleanly whilst also making United look like the clowns they truly are. I bet Jonathan Wilson is looking on admiringly.”29 min: The United songbook in the Prenton Park cowshed has turned to the Glazer family. “We want Glazers out” gets a hearty go. 27 min: United passing the ball around on the Prenton Park paddy field with far more comfort than they have done for some time on the Old Trafford bowling green surface. Funny old game. 26 min: Duncan Edwards emails in: “Oh dear, John, seems like you are going to have to rip up your United in chaos gag script and just commentate on the match. Now that’s funny.”Lads, it’s Tranmere.24 min: Perkins falls over on a pothole but Jesse Lingard is penalised. That looks a harsh decision. Blackett-Taylot then escapes down the flank and puts a promising ball across goal but there are no takers.

I work hard, own a home and live a fairly good life. My problem is that I can’t help but feel regretful that I never had children. I can’t quite believe this is how my life turned out. When I was younger I ached for my own child.I have a partner currently. We don’t live together, he’s younger than I am and quite possibly the loveliest man I’ve been in a relationship with. It’s too late for me to conceive now and IVF isn’t an option as we don’t have the money. He says he doesn’t care, but he dotes on friends’ children and I fear that when he’s older he’ll feel regretful, too.In previous relationships I’ve had two abortions and two miscarriages and I’m not sure I ever recovered emotionally. I somehow got my life back on track, though I suffered another miscarriage along the way. Those losses left me feeling numb and I pretend to others who ask that I made positive choices. I feel ashamed, guilty and cowardly.I want to know how to get through these next few years unscathed. I’m too serious, anxious about money, the environment, everything. I suppose I am a typical spinster cat-woman. I fear the emotional wrecking ball of the menopause and want to move on and to not think about what could have been – but it’s getting worse, not better.Mariella replies Don’t panic! It sounds like you are living through a full-blown midlife crisis. No one wants to think they are just a number, but sometimes it’s easier to navigate life’s difficulties when you know you’ve got company – and companions with similar concerns are one thing you won’t be short of as you hit 50, brimful of anxiety, regrets and melancholy. There’s no shame in seeking help and the best place to start is with your local GP, provided they have menopause experience, so they can sort hormonal bedlam from mental wear and tear.You’ve reached the first age of reckoning and you’d be one in a million if there weren’t plenty of choices you’d love to rethink with the benefit of hindsight. I’m afraid that has to stop. There is no gain and a lot to lose in looking over your shoulder instead of keeping your gaze firmly forward-facing. The past is a place to mine for happy memories, not dwell on for those that are less so. It’s easier said than done, but it’s definitely possible. Dwelling on the many things I could have done better, some major, some minor, would definitely flatten me.I’ve front-loaded on the negativity because, quite honestly, the future is far brighter than you envisage. I understand your regrets about not having children and agree the likelihood of getting pregnant now is extremely slim. You can sit around and mourn or consider the surfeit of opportunities offered by not being responsible for anyone but yourself. Whether it’s relocation or re-education, your bucket list is far more achievable than if you were a parent saddled with the cost of an umbilical connection you can’t shake off.A close friend, like you, wanted children, but didn’t have them. Quite honestly, it’s her unfettered lifestyle I envy most when my teenagers make Harry Enfield’s best caricature of adolescent angst seem normal! Instead of rueing your misfortune, write a list of all the amazing things you can do now you’re mature and solvent, grab your younger man and start ticking them off.What’s predictably human is that despite the much longer list of achievements you have to celebrate – a good job, trophy boyfriend, decent lifestyle, own home – you’ve zoomed in on the one ambition you have not succeeded with. They are not minor details to be shunted aside, but amount to the very things that most kids hope one day to achieve.Whatever you choose, the life lesson remains the same. From now on it’s imperative to be grateful for what you’ve got, not preoccupied by what you haven’t. And finally, the menopause… well that’s a whole other conversation, but a good place to begin is on BBC iPlayer with my documentary The Truth About the Menopause. Reaching midlife is a time for contemplation, but also for positive action. With half your life left to live there are options aplenty and inspiring ways to move forward. You just need to review your perspective. • Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

Yet it’s Lamar’s MAAD City that the DJ plays to prime the crowd before the South Central LA rapper rolls on stage to the quaking Gang Gang, suggesting that Hanley feels neither eclipsed by his friend’s successes nor incapable of rising to them. Hanley’s raps still lack the gravitas and invention to do that – rooted as most of his rhymes are in the trite gangster stuff of drugs, guns and girls for hire. But his easy way with a hook never lets him down, and his performance is energetic and focused in an atmosphere enhanced by the omnipresent pong of CBD oil.“My shirt’s drenched with sweat!” Hanley proclaims after shimmying hard in oppressive heat to his old-school ode to being a school-age gang member John Muir. He should have spared a thought for the two men in black with paper bags on their heads propped sternly unmoving on stools behind him for the show’s entire 75 minutes – a nod to the artwork for his latest album, Crash Talk. Think a surrealist answer to Public Enemy’s security personnel S1Ws.Hanley’s bacchanalian collaboration with 2 Chainz and Saudi, X, and the hard-hitting Floating, featuring 21 Savage, underscore why he remains a man in demand. He drops the tempo with Crash before opening up a pit for the shuddering Numb Numb Juice.

Union Jack flags will also line Parliament Square and the Mall on Friday and the public will see government buildings in Whitehall lit up in red, white and blue.To add to the celebratory mood the government wants to encourage, “a commemorative light display” will be staged in Downing Street in the run-up to 11pm, the hour that the UK will officially end its 47 year membership of Europe’s club of nations. A countdown clock will be projected on to it from 10pm. Officials said the light display will “symbolise the strength and unity” of the four nations that make up the United Kingdom.The prime minister said last night: “Next Friday marks an important moment in the history of our United Kingdom. No matter how you voted in 2016, it is the time to look ahead with confidence to the global, trailblazing country we will become over the next decade and heal past isions. That is what I will be doing on 31 January and I urge everyone across the UK to do the same.”But politicians who fought to remain in the EU said the events were deeply inappropriate. Heseltine told the Observer: “Brexit is the most isive issue of modern times. Those of us who fought to remain did so sincerely in the interests of our country and subsequent generations who we believe should be influential at the heart of Europe.“I think it is unwise of the government to rub our noses in it by celebrating our defeat at this hour, whilst talking about unifying the country.”He said the only comfort was that plans to chime Big Ben to mark the moment the UK leaves had been dropped.“At least we are spared the sound of Big Ben being chimed at our discomfort.” Adapting the quote from John Donne the Tory peer added: “Send not to inquire for whom the bells tolls. It tolls for thee.”The Liberal Democrats’ acting leader, Ed Davey, accused Johnson of using public money for an inappropriate, isive event. “The prime minister should be seeking to pull the country together, not gloat with an expensive party on the public purse,” he said.The SNP leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said: “It grieves me that we should be leaving the greatest postwar peace project ever created. That is not something we should be celebrating.”Sometime during the night on Friday, the union flag will be quietly removed from outside the European Parliament buildings in Strasbourg and Brussels, and from the UK representation in Brussels, which will be renamed in due course.Claude Moraes, who has served as a Labour MEP for more than 20 years and will attend the European Parliament for the last time on Thursday, said the government events to mark Brexit were wrong. “All this make me feels very uneasy. The country is still bruised and ided. The British thing to do would be to mark the occasion in a way that respects the views of both sides, and that recognises the national ide.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01bf2392988876a739f211a3547a3da6bba4198e/0_61_3076_1846/master/3076.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6117478e7f2484d72c179c3f19844947","title":"brexit uk trade talks steve barclay eu","story":"Steve Barclay says UK will not erge from EU for the sake of ergingThe UK will set out its negotiating aims for trade talks with the EU by early February and will not erge from Brussels’ rules for the sake of it, Steve Barclay has said.The Brexit secretary, whose job will become defunct when the UK leaves the EU on 31 January, set a more moderate tone than some of his colleagues who insist the UK will be looking for no alignment with the EU after Brexit.Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, he said the broad aims for trade talks would be set out within the next month, with Boris Johnson expected to make a speech revealing his approach.Barclay said: “The key issue is that we will have control of our rules, we will not be a rule-taker, we will not erge for the sake of erging, we start from a position of alignment. But the key opportunity is that we will be able to set our standards, high standards, on workers’ rights, on the environment, on state aid as part of that trade policy.”He argued the UK and the EU would be able to negotiate a zero-tariff and zero-quota deal even while Britain was insisting on some degree of regulatory ergence. “We’re coming out of the single market, we’re coming out of the customs union. We’re not just going to erge just for the sake of it – we need to look at where the opportunities are.“But it is true that we are going to have control of our approach to regulation and that’s the very essence of Brexit: that we can do things differently, particularly where, for example, there is innovation, there is new technologies, there’s things where we want to move quickly. Brexit at its very core is that we will have control of our laws, our regulation and that is why we can’t be a rule-taker. We need to have that opportunity.”Earlier, Priti Patel sounded a different note as she focused on ergence. The home secretary told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “There is no disagreement in government at all: we are clear – we are leaving. “In terms of ergence, we are not having alignment. We will be erging. We want to take control of our laws, money and our borders. And to do that we will not be rule-takers – we will be setting our own laws and that is a fundamental feature of leaving the European Union.”Last week Sajid Javid alarmed businesses by saying in an FT interview that there would not be alignment with the EU after Brexit. The chancellor insisted firms must adjust to new regulations. However, he toned down his comments later in the week to say there would only be ergence where it made sense to do so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9164fe760f18b5a79e1abd0033369069807f1cdd/833_213_4633_2780/master/4633.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4308b2ef57de6ed23e68950ee4e3d705","title":"corbyn allies line up top jobs before new leader elected","story":"Allies of Jeremy Corbyn have been accused of trying to cement their power at the top of the party after they announced plans to appoint new staff to senior posts before the next leader is elected.The party sent an email to staff last week advertising posts of head of press and broadcasting, head of policy development, and deputy regional director in London. The applications have to be made by early February.The move by Labour headquarters, under the control of general secretary Jennie Formby, has prompted suspicion that Corbyn’s supporters are trying to install their own people in key roles made vacant by departing staff, to ensure some continuity once Corbyn leaves in April, rather than letting a new leader fill the posts once in office.The first stage of the contest was for potential contenders to get the backing of 22 fellow MPs by 13 January. Five MPs passed this threshold: Keir Starmer (88 nominations),\u0026nbsp Rebecca Long-Bailey (33), Lisa Nandy (31), Jess Phillips (23) and Emily Thornberry (23).The ballot of members and registered supporters opens a week later on 21 February, and closes at noon on 2 April. To be eligible to vote you must have been a Labour member on 20 January, or have applied to have become a £25 registered supporter by 16 January.Corbyn’s successor will be announced at a special conference in London on 4 April.One party insider said: “It is obvious that some of these jobs are of sufficient seniority and importance to how the Labour party will work for many years that they should not be advertised and appointed until the new leader is in place. The general secretary needs to call a halt to this. Otherwise it looks like the party is trying to impose senior press and policy staff on whoever is elected leader in April.” A Labour source denied there was any such intention, saying it had never been within the power of the leader to appoint people to the posts and that it would be unprecedented to delay filling the jobs until April.“These roles are operational, and have always been appointed within HQ, not by the leader,” a Labour source said. “The party machinery continues regardless of any leadership election. Waiting three months to fill urgent vacancies would undermine the party’s activity, including the mayoral and local election campaigns.”The dispute reflects deep tensions between rival wings of the party – and supporters of the four remaining candidates for the leadership – over its future direction and structures, following Labour’s worst general election result since 1935.Rebecca Long-Bailey is widely believed to have the backing of Corbyn himself and has already secured support of the grassroots pro-Corbyn movement Momentum.Last week she received a further boost, winning the endorsement of the country’s second biggest union, Unite. Its general secretary, Len McCluskey, a close ally of the outgoing leader, lauded her “brains and brilliance”. She now needs the backing of one more union or affiliated society to get onto the ballot paper with Keir Starmer and Lisa Nandy.The fourth contender, Emily Thornberry, is trying to use the other route onto the ballot paper, by gaining the support of 33 constituency Labour parties (CLPs). Yesterday Starmer had won the backing of 39 CLPs, Long-Bailey 15, Nandy 9 and Thornberry only 3.Nandy, who has emerged as a strong challenger to both Starmer and Long-Bailey, will this week seek to position herself as the candidate with the best “green” credentials when she unveils plans to end all public funding for overseas fossil-fuel projects. This follows a BBC Newsnight investigation that revealed that a government agency, UK Export Finance, channelled UK taxpayers’ money into fossil-fuel projects around the world, which will together emit 69m tonnes of carbon a year. This is roughly equivalent to a sixth of the total carbon emissions of the UK.Nandy said: “If I become prime minister, I would put a stop to all public financing of fossil-fuel projects anywhere, and offer incentives to job-creating, clean-energy exports instead.“But the climate emergency means we also need to crack down on city banks to stop them investing our pensions and savings in the things fuelling the crisis and worsening poverty, flooding and wildfires across the world. In the year our country hosts the next major UN climate-change summit, we need bold action.”Voted to remain and supported the party’s ambiguous Brexit policy.

Here he charts the key moments in a stormy relationship and the missed chances to save it from destructionLast week, with the end of the UK’s 47-year membership of the club of European nations just days away, I looked back at some newspaper cuttings from my time as a Brussels correspondent. A picture of worried-looking farmers eyeing up their cattle at a market in Banbury stared out alongside banner headlines. “British beef banned in Europe. Cattle prices fall. School meals hit. EU ‘rules’ broken.” Among the many crises in British relations with the EU down the years – from Margaret Thatcher’s bust-up over the European budget in the early 1980s to the UK’s exit from the ERM in 1992 – the beef war between London and Brussels ranks among the biggest.It was 29 March, 1996, and the European commission had just announced a worldwide ban on the export of British beef. The EU’s executive opted for decisive action after the Tory government admitted there could be a link between “mad cow” disease and the mutant strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which could kill humans. I had been in Brussels less than three months. It was a huge story, and reading through articles I had written at the time, it felt like yesterday. But what was most striking, as my mind fixed again on events of 24 years ago, was how relevant that one prolonged and tortuous episode seemed today, in the context of Brexit.When the European commission dropped its bombshell, France and Germany had already imposed their own unilateral bans on British beef. UK ministers had announced that millions of cattle across the UK would have to be slaughtered. Thousands of schools took meat off their lunch menus. Beef prices tumbled. Inevitably, in those testy post-Maastricht days of Tory rows over Europe, Eurosceptic MPs blamed the Europeans. The late Sir Teddy Taylor, a hardline anti-EU campaigner on the Conservative backbenches, urged retaliation in the form of a ban on French wine and French beef, while Bill Cash, still a Tory MP to this day, wanted to take the European commission to court.Throughout that spring and summer, the crisis widened. This was a time when the ambitions of the EU’s true believers in Brussels, Bonn and Paris were at their height. Helmut Kohl and Jacques Chirac were planning the launch of the euro, for the big leap towards political and monetary union that the Maastricht treaty had charted a course. Europe’s leaders were preparing also to admit several countries of former communist eastern Europe. The enlargement project was one of which the UK thoroughly approved. The British government believed in a Europe that was “wider not deeper”.But John Major, who had launched his premiership in 1990 with a promise to put Britain “at the heart of Europe”, found himself trapped politically as the BSE disaster worsened. The rightwing tabloids were in full anti-EU cry, demanding he fight the beef ban like he was Margaret Thatcher. In an editorial at the end of March, the Sun warned that the survival of an independent UK, no less, was at stake: “If Brussels has the power to stop Britain from selling a product anywhere in the world, then we are no longer an independent sovereign nation with control over our own affairs,” the paper said. “We are just one of the herd. John Bull has been neutered.”Back home, Tony Blair and New Labour were racing ahead in the polls. On 21 May, Major went for broke and, to try to calm the “bastards” in his own party, announced that the UK would refuse to co-operate in EU meetings until further notice. British non-co-operation with Europe – and its policies – had become official policy.It was no small move to make. In areas where British ministers had a veto in council meetings, non-co-operation meant they would effectively be blocking EU decisions, thwarting European plans for deeper integration. In mid-May 1996 Major told the House of Commons: “Without progress towards lifting the ban we cannot be expected to cooperate normally on other Community business. We cannot continue business as usual within Europe when we are faced with the clear disregard by some of our partners of reason, of common sense and of Britain’s national interest.”Non co-operation quickly took relations between London and Brussels to a historic low. For the first time in more than two decades serious questions were being asked about Britain’s membership, publicly, by senior British and European politicians. The beef crisis in itself was an isolated, very specific issue. But the way it had spiralled had highlighted deep faultlines in a relationship between a member state determined not to cede powers, and much of whose media was virulently anti-Brussels, and the proponents of a postwar European project that had as its entire purpose the unification of Europe, and the necessary surrender by participants of ever more sovereignty to the centre.EU leaders were beginning to wonder if the UK could continue as a full member if it was prepared to put ners in the works of integration whenever it had a grievance. In a newspaper article in early June 1996 the then European commission president Jacques Santer warned that “l’heure de vérité” was approaching. The late Sir Leon Brittan, then the UK’s commissioner, sensing a potentially disastrous breach, told UK businessmen in the same week to start speaking up for Europe “if we are not to be lured, step by insidious step, on the dangerous path towards leaving the European Union”.This coming Friday, 31 January, at midnight in Brussels, and 11pm UK time, it will all be over. The worst fears of the pro-Europeans here and on the continent will have been realised. The Union flag will be lowered overnight, discreetly at the European parliament buildings in Brussels and Strasbourg and at the UK representation in Brussels. The UK will be out. The flag that will fly until Friday in the EU capital’s parliament building will be moved to the House of European History museum nearby. British membership will thereafter be a piece of history on display. In London, Boris Johnson’s Conservative government will project the moment as the beginning of a new dawn. No 10 will stage a special lights display at 11pm. Ten million commemorative 50p coins will come into circulation before the end of the year. Johnson will be one of the first to receive one.For those of us who have spent so many years watching the UK’s relationship with the EU closely, the final act of leaving will be hard to take in. In the minds of everyone in the EU who had always wanted the relationship to succeed, there will always be deep regrets, and questions that can never fully be answered. Could it have worked? If so, was the EU or the UK, or were both, to blame? Which British and EU leaders fell short? Or was it always doomed to failure?As we prepare to leave, I asked diplomats, politicians, journalists on both sides of the channel why they thought Brexit had come to pass and they cited a multitude of reasons. The deep differences in postwar attitudes between the UK and its European partners poor leadership in the EU and UK a constantly hostile British media, and sheer bad luck and timing.Sir Nigel Sheinwald, a former UK ambassador to the EU and Washington, believes all these factors played their parts. “Europe always seemed a matter of choice, not necessity for the UK, unlike for France and Germany,” he said. “Successive generations of British political leaders failed to explain the realities and the centrality of our membership, preferring to live with, rather than confront, decades of British media little-Englandism. Then the short-term perfect storm – the impact of the financial crisis, the anti-establishment mood, and the open goal left by Cameron’s casual failure of leadership and Corbyn’s Euroscepticism.“Brexit was never inevitable, and the irony is that we are leaving an organisation more aligned than at any time since we joined with the British priorities of free trade, competition, active and responsible international policies, and cooperation on security.”The German MP Norbert Röttgen, who chairs the foreign affairs committee in the Bundestag, suggested the idea of the UK leaving was always so alien and nightmarish for EU leaders that they blinded themselves to the warning signals. By the time of the 2016 referendum the chance to find compromise had been lost.“For the EU it was unimaginable that a country might choose to leave the union,” Röttgen said. “As a consequence they underestimated the severity of the situation and gave David Cameron nothing to work with during the referendum. To be fair, given all the opt-outs the UK already had, that would not have been easy, but the EU’s lack of trying was a mistake.” The German MEP David McAllister, born to a Scottish father and German mother, and who was bought up in West Berlin, says the UK’s decision to opt out of the euro and Schengen open borders agreement was a turning point which took the UK down a road to disengagement from the core. “The beginning of the end was Maastricht. Not joining the two biggest projects, the joint currency and Schengen.” But enlargement to the east – which, ironically, the UK had championed – also played its part, he believes, creating huge new issues around freedom of movement which the UK could not resolve with its partners before the eventual referendum. “Free movement was vital for those new members and they did not want to give way.”As in any marriage there were happier times. After Edward Heath had taken the UK into the European Economic Community in 1973, successive prime ministers – Thatcher, Major, Blair, Gordon Brown – all entered office proclaiming themselves strong Europeans. Even Cameron said he wanted his party to stop “banging on” about Europe. In 1975, addressing the Conservative Group for Europe, before the confirmatory referendum later that year, Thatcher proudly proclaimed her pro-EC views, and taunted Labour over its European isions. “We are inextricably part of Europe,” she said. “Neither Mr Foot nor Mr Benn nor anyone else will ever be able to take us ‘out of Europe’, for Europe is where we are and where have always been,” she declared.But for every UK prime minister since the 1970s, rows with Europe were always round the corner. In her first years in No 10 Thatcher fought and won a bruising battle to cut the UK’s payments to the European budget, before securing the EU rebate at Fontainbleu in 1984. After that, however, she was a tireless champion of the European single market, before falling out with Jacques Delors and Helmut Kohl over their plans for full monetary union in the late 1980s.Charles Powell, her foreign policy adviser at the time, says her European enthusiasm went in phases. “Rather like Picasso she had her blue and her pink phases,” Powell says. “For five-and-a-half years she was very awkward over the budget. After 1984, however, it was more positive as she drove the single market forward. Then she felt betrayed over the single currency.” But he insists she never contemplated leaving the EU.Many in the EU believe it was Thatcher who set the direction of travel. Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister, says she introduced the idea of “exceptionalism” (rebates and opt-outs) which undermined Europe’s unity and efficiency.“It started with the rebate of Thatcher,” he said. “By granting something like the rebate you encourage those who don’t want or like the basic story of the European Union. The consequence is that the EU is not effective because of these exceptions. It cannot act there, it can only partially act here. That then fuels the Eurosceptics again, who say ‘you see it doesn’t work!’ By creating these exceptions we planted a seed to make the EU ineffective, and for the exiteers to make their case.”For Major, who succeeded Thatcher, the crises never ceased. The UK’s exit from the ERM in autumn 1992 was one from which he never really recovered. He fought and secured the single currency opt-out from Maastricht but the “bastards” in his party never let up. In the later days of his administration he tried to convince EU leaders to adopt ideas for a two-speed Europe in which the UK would be in the slower lane but, by that stage, they were waiting for Blair to win the 1997 election and open a new period of positive relations.I can remember the excitement in EU circles at Blair’s first European summit in late May 1997 after 18 years of Thatcher and Major. At that meeting in Noordwijk in the Netherlands the Italian news agency, Ansa, headed its main report “Tony Blair, Superstar” and Italian journalists called it “Blair day in Europe”. Labour’s election manifesto had left open the possibility of the UK joining the euro when the conditions were right. Blair was genuine and serious about wanting to change the mood.But he had won the support of Rupert Murdoch’s newspapers, including the Sun, for the 1997 election and Alastair Campbell clearly spotted danger. Campbell arrived on the European scene appearing disdainful, no doubt deliberately, of many of the EU’s complex and arcane debates, describing them as “eurobollocks”, because he feared a tabloid backlash if Blair was too pro-EU.At the same meeting in Noordwijk he accused me of “going native” for writing about voting systems in the EU, which he had not by then got his head around.There was a smugness about the Blair administration – remarked on by his own officials at the time – in its early dealings with the EU, which infuriated European leaders. Within months, rows blew up between Blair and Brown on the UK side, and Kohl and Chirac on the other, as the UK demanded the right to be present at meetings of European finance ministers whose countries had agreed to join the euro, despite the UK having refused to commit itself to entry.At one summit in Luxembourg, Chirac became so irritated that he told Blair he would have to learn to bow his head three times to the tricolore before he could earn his spurs in the EU. The greatest frustration came when EU leaders realised that Brown had, with his adviser Ed Balls, designed a foolproof means of blocking Blair from joining the euro, through his five tests. Verhofstadt and other leaders say Blair, whose relations with Chirac and others deteriorated further with the Iraq war, had a chance to change the course of history but fell short. And so after Brown’s difficult premiership, in which he promoted his ideas of Britishness far more than any European vision, came Cameron, who had launched his bid for the Tory leadership with a pledge to take the UK out of the main centre-right grouping, the European People’s party, positioning himself initially as a firm Eurosceptic. When he called the 2016 inout referendum he promised to renegotiate a better deal for the UK in the EU that he hoped would persuade people to vote to remain. The rest is history.He failed to secure sufficient concessions from the EU to win over fellow Tories, including Boris Johnson and Michael Gove who would campaign to leave. Cameron opened the door to a British exit and the British people walked through it on 23 June, 2016.Cameron is the name most often cited in the EU as people search for iniduals to blame for Brexit. Röttgen says: “At a critical time, when the UK needed true leadership it had poor political personnel in place. David Cameron proved to be a coward, lacking the kind of statesmanship John Major had demonstrated during his term.”But Röttgen knows, as does everyone, that it was the entire European political class that failed to stop the “unimaginable” happening. His fellow countryman McAllister – with British and German roots – is more mournful ahead of Brexit day. “It will be very sad,” he says. “I hardly know anyone who welcomes this and who will not miss the British, their pragmatism, their humour, their knowledge. January 31 will be a very emotional day. I do not want to be in Brussels on the day the Union Jack is taken down.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c3c39454c3ce6aca3d0e801d904b821a54c2fce/0_67_3145_1887/master/3145.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68aa5c6475989763a2bc3a891ca64b72","title":"priti patel radicalised youth plan so flawed its mad","story":"A Home Office-funded study into tackling radicalisation among young people has concluded that the approach being pushed through by the home secretary, Priti Patel, is so flawed that it is “madness”.Instead the research, which will be unveiled on Wednesday and is described as one of the biggest scientific surveys of its type in Europe, found that the most effective strategy was precisely the opposite approach pursued by Patel. Generating “positive psychology” among young people was found to be significantly more effective than punitive policies when challenging “violent youth radicalisation”, defined as gang crime through to the development of extreme ideologies.Its conclusions contradict Patel’s hardline approach, typified by measures announced last week that emphasised longer jail terms for violent and terrorist offenders, lie-detector tests and increased monitoring.Rather than rolling out more draconian measures to contain “risk”, the Youth Empowerment and Innovation Project, part funded by the Home Office, found that offering encouragement to youngsters and addressing factors such as social exclusion was a better way to mitigate violent youth radicalisation.The findings will be unveiled this week at an international conference at the University of East London’s school of psychology with speakers including the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, officials from the European Commission and prominent academics.However, Home Office enthusiasm for the project has, say sources, cooled over the past year under Sajid Javid and Patel, who succeeded Javid as home secretary last July. No minister from the Home Office has so far accepted an invitation to appear at the conference.“Unfortunately the Home Office, which was supposed to lead on this project, has disengaged over the last year,” said Professor Theo Gavrielides, who led the three-year study.Gavrielides, whose researchers interviewed 3,540 young people and professionals in schools, youth prisons, universities, migrant centres and online, said the UK government’s policy of managing risk and profiling possible offenders was backfiring.“The research provides new evidence that by attempting to profile and predict violent youth radicalisation, we may in fact be breeding the very reasons that lead those at risk to violent acts.The project, piloted in schools, universities and youth offending institutions, found that when young people were encouraged to develop a talent or pastime, the radicalisation process was successfully challenged.Gavrielides added: “Our project showed a positive way of engaging youth at risk, tapping into their talents rather than treating them as society risks.”He added there were significant economic benefits with the average £80,000 annual cost of keeping an inidual in a Youth Offending Institute sufficient to fund the same young person to the best university for three years.His research also received funding from the EU’s Erasmus+ programme as well as other public bodies from across Europe and was coordinated by the IARS International Institute.Professor Aneta Tunariu, dean of the school of psychology at the University of East London, said: “The YEIP represents a remarkable milestone in our collective understanding and approach to tackling the psychosocial conditions that overshadow and silence life-hope and its primordial place for human flourishing, fuelling marginalisation, misunderstandings, injustice and ultimately anger and ision.”Unveiling her new measures last week, Patel said the government had faced “hard truths” since the London Bridge attack in November, which was carried out by convicted terrorist Usman Khan out on licence from prison.Among the measures included in a bill to be brought before parliament by mid-March was a minimum jail term of 14 years for serious crimes"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31136ce998a49f288e41848af6585f1a0e7357c/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77932bb35b0fe9163ffbbf85ebb3272b","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youMore than 1,280 infected and 18 cities in lockdown in China as officials try to stem spread of virus which has reached Europe, the US and Australia.

Since this is a new coronavirus there might be some changes in the coming days and weeks, and the danger it poses to people of different ages is also changing.”Officials announced a range of measures on Sunday, including a nationwide ban on trading in wildlife, and the suspension of long-distance buses in the eastern province of Shandong, which has a population of 100 million people. Long-distance buses have also been banned from departing from or arriving at Beijing and Shanghai.Authorities believe the new strain of coronavirus came from a seafood market in Wuhan, where wildlife was sold illegally. The city remains under a strict lockdown, while various travel restrictions have been imposed across at least 20 other cities, affecting tens of millions of people.On Sunday evening, Wang Xiaodong, the governor of Hubei province, where most cases have been concentrated, said that the party central committee and the people of the whole country were worried. “We felt very sad, very guilty,” he said.The disease has so far spread to more than 10 other countries, including France, the US and Australia. The incubation period for the virus could range from one day to two weeks, Ma said, but experts remained unclear about the risk of the virus mutating and said it was possible that the number of infections would continue to grow.On Sunday, Beijing said that the reopening of schools and universities after the new year holiday had been indefinitely suspended. Elsewhere, Hong Kong Disneyland announced on Sunday it had closed following the government’s declaration of an emergency to combat the crisis.Health teams are working urgently to determine the origin of the disease. It is from the same family of viruses as Sars, which was passed to humans from bats by masked palm civets, and Mers, which was carried from bats to humans by camels.A new nationwide ban on the sale of wildlife will affect markets, restaurants and online shops. Health experts have long raised concerns about unhygienic and cramped conditions in some Chinese markets, where wild and often poached animals are packed together.In Wuhan, where the outbreak began, the streets remained deserted on Sunday, with rules keeping most private cars off the roads. Relatives who would usually have spent the new year holiday together were forced to cancel plans and stay in their separate homes.Some residents told the  they were remaining calm and believed the quarantine measures were the only way to halt the virus. Others, however, expressed concern about how vulnerable people would be affected by the lockdown.“Each time the government issues different measures, it is a rough approach, and they are the ones who cause panic. I couldn’t sleep at night when they announced to close the city and I was in shock,” said Miss Huang, 22, from Wuhan, who added that the local government’s failure to act quickly had created distrust.The increase in reported deaths and illnesses does not necessarily mean the crisis is getting worse, but could reflect better monitoring. Those killed by the virus have mostly been middle-aged or elderly people, as well as people with underlying health conditions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08a1c945a501986da59e823deddf0ad5c3546ab4/0_198_6048_3628/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78dc9a78efd8b021a7182bf4d64abc99","title":"coronavirus from food market to global panic response mistakes","story":"China was praised for its early response to the diseaseIn the final days of 2019, Xia Qingqing joined her parents for a late-night dinner just 200 metres away from the now-notorious South China seafood market, in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.It has since been identified as the source of the new coronavirus that has infected more than 1,400 people worldwide, killed more than 40 and plunged China into chaos. Just as hundreds of millions of people should be reuniting with their families to celebrate the biggest holiday of the year, the lunar new year, swathes of the country have been put on lockdown and celebrations all but called off.As Xia and her parents tucked into a special winter rice and egg porridge on 27 December, even city authorities may not have known that the virus had started spreading around the city.It was not until three days later that they put out a public warning about a “pneumonia of unknown cause” which doctors had identified in Wuhan, and four days later that national authorities filed their first report about the outbreak with the World Health Organisation.In early January, 36-year-old Xia started running a low fever. By then, authorities had closed the seafood market for disinfection, and identified 44 patients with the unknown pneumonia.But when she went to a local hospital on 4 January for a check-up, no one asked Xia about possible links to the market, or mentioned the mystery new illness. Doctors told her to go home, rest and take over-the-counter medication.She followed their advice but her condition continued to worsen. Her fever intensified, she started having respiratory problems, and eating or drinking became painful.Her illness was developing in tandem with knowledge about the mysterious new outbreak. On 9 January, China announced it had identified a new coronavirus, from the same family that caused the 2002 Sars outbreak, in one of the Wuhan patients. Like all viruses in the corona family, it had originated in an animal scientists were already racing to uncover the source.The next day, authorities announced the first death from the disease and released the genetic sequence of the new virus online for study, winning plaudits for an approach that seemed very different from the official cover-up that exacerbated the Sars crisis.There were even hopes that Beijing might have managed to stop the outbreak before it had really begun. On 13 January, Chinese authorities said they had not identified any new cases for over a week and although a first case was reported outside the country in a traveller to China, she had first developed symptoms days earlier.If the disease came only from eating some kind of infected animal, and the market where it had originated was shut, there was perhaps a real possibility that no further cases would appear.But it has now emerged that even though China freely shared details of the cases it had identified in the early days of January, doctors on the ground in the city where the disease began were not testing widely for the new virus as the month progressed.There is growing concern that a failure to carry out comprehensive testing during the early days of the outbreak could have helped the virus spread.Xia believes she is one of many victims who do not show up in statistics she was finally admitted to hospital on the day after the genetic code was released. Despite her link to the market at the centre of the outbreak, and symptoms that matched those of confirmed victims, she was never tested.“Before there were any testing kits, which was before 16 January, I was regarded as a highly suspected case, meaning that I showed almost all of the symptoms,” Xia told the Observer.But the hospital was already struggling with a sharp increase in patients showing symptoms that matched the reported coronavirus ones. Xia estimates that there were only two doctors on staff to check hundreds of people seeking help.Terribly overstretched, they focused only on the most serious cases and so on 20 January doctors discharged Xia into the care of her parents, without even formally noting her link to the South China seafood market on medical notes.That was the day China confirmed the disease could be spread between humans, rather than just picked up direct from an animal source.The number of patients had tripled, cases had appeared in other major cities, including the capital Beijing, and in a sign of official concern, the country’s authoritarian president, Xi Jinping, made his first comments on the virus, saying it must be “resolutely contained”.Yet Xia was sent home, still sick, without having been tested. She is being cared for by her parents, but is terrified she might infect them they try to protect themselves by staying five metres away from her at all times.Three days later, China stunned its citizens and the world by putting Wuhan under quarantine. From the morning of 23 January, no trains, planes or public transport would be allowed to leave the city roadblocks later stopped most private cars from leaving either.Closing off a major industrial and commercial hub, home to 11 million people, was the bluntest possible admission that Beijing was now extremely worried about the new disease. Further decisive action included a pledge to build a new 1,000-bed hospital dedicated to the disease in under a week, and a second within two weeks.Work has already started on the first, and given China’s track record of throwing up a similar hospital in Beijing during the Sars crisis, there is little doubt that the prefabricated facility will be finished in this extraordinary timescale.And in a sign that authorities had shifted from trying to downplay the disease, a very last-minute tribute to the doctors and nurses battling the disease was included in the new year television gala show, one of the most high-profile broadcasts of the year.By the time lunar new year’s day dawned , the government had gone even further. More than 50 million people were in lockdown across the country, and nearly every province in China had declared a “level 1” health emergency, the most serious kind, which allows quarantines and other serious measures.Yet all this may come too late to ward off a major public health crisis, infectious disease experts have warned. Yi Guan, a senior Hong Kong-based virologist who helped identify the cause of the Sars virus, said he was much more worried about this disease, and feared the window for controlling its spread might already have closed.“I’ve never felt scared. This time I’m scared,” Yi, who heads the University of Hong Kong’s state key laboratory of emerging infectious diseases, told China’s influential Caixin magazine.He visited Wuhan expecting to find the city on a “war footing” but instead was met with chaos and incompetence.“I don’t think the local government has done what it should do,” he said. “They haven’t even been handing out quarantine guides to people who were leaving.”The coronavirus could hardly have emerged at a worse time for Chinese authorities, appearing in the weeks before the lunar new year, China’s most important holiday. It is usually the occasion for the biggest human migration on the planet – up to 3 billion trips – as people race home to celebrate with family, travelling on packed trains, buses and planes.For the army of migrant workers from rural towns and villages who have powered decades of economic growth in China, it can be the only time in the year they get to return home and see their children and parents who have stayed behind.Even as the scale of the crisis became apparent, millions whose travel plans did not take them near Wuhan packed their bags and set off for the annual reunion, although many journeys were longer than usual.Evidence that patients may be able to carry the disease without any fever, cough or other common symptoms has added to concern. Tests have showed that a child in one family who did not appear unwell was in fact carrying the disease, the Lancet has reported.But widespread apprehension has changed the nature of the celebration. Normally a time for parties and celebration, banquets and fireworks, instead across the country – even in places far from the centre or any reported cases – people were cancelling their party plans and staying home.Streets, malls and restaurants were empty, attractions from the Great Wall to the Forbidden City and Shanghai’s Disneyland had closed, and from Monday all group tourism – domestic and foreign – will be suspended.Instead, many people stayed at home, and took to the internet to find out more about the crisis. From the early days of the outbreak, warnings were appearing on China’s vibrant but censored social media. In early January, eight people were arrested for “spreading hoaxes” about what came to be known as the coronavirus, AFP reported.Weeks later, vast numbers of people were turning to the internet for information about the crisis, as state media downplayed it and kept it off the front page of official papers, such as the People’s Daily, and out of the main headlines on key television news programmes.On Saturday, discussion about the disease on micro-blogging site Weibo had reached 8 billion views, according to the What’s on Weibo website. “It’s very rare to see news topics get this big,” site editor Manya Koetse said on Twitter.By Saturday evening, China had confirmed it was dealing with a total of 1,372 confirmed cases, and a death toll of 41. Together with cases identified outside China – spread from Australia to the United States and France – more than 1,400 people have been infected. By comparison, during the main Sars epidemic, which lasted from late 2002 until July 2003, in total 8,098 people got sick, and 774 died.Although most of the victims who have died from this new coronavirus have been older, and some have been in bad health, more people could be at risk if overwhelmed hospitals are not able to treat those with the disease. There is no cure or vaccine, but medical support can help patients’ own immune systems to fight the disease.Xia – who is no longer feverish but has a bad cough, often producing blood – says she is comforted by the actions of the central government now in taking control.“At this point I think the focus should be on how, together, we’re going to pull through,” she said. But she thinks Wuhan officials will bear the brunt of scrutiny in coming weeks and months.“There can be no doubt they simply missed the best time for containing the outbreak,” she said. “The Wuhan government didn’t offer timely and effective support to hospitals in terms of medical materials … they failed to raise awareness among the public.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/695e5f4332f1285b4ec0cf3a3dc3db3bf407490d/181_0_3241_1944/master/3241.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3114639861988be6ac84a5fbea4db38","title":"what is the coronavirus wuhan china virus sars symptoms","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the virus from Wuhan in China, how does it relate to Sars, and at what point should you go to the doctor?It is a novel coronavirus – that is to say, a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city, which also sold live and newly slaughtered animals. New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are examples.The virus causes pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died are known to have been already in poor health.Human to human transmission has been confirmed by China’s national health commission. As of 24 January the Chinese authorities had acknowledged more than 1,000 cases and 41 deaths. In the past week, the number of confirmed infections has more than tripled and cases have been found in 13 provinces, as well as the municipalities Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin. The virus has also been confirmed outside China, in Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam. There have not been any confirmed cases in the UK at present, with the 14 people tested for the virus all proving negative. The actual number to have contracted the virus could be far higher as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by WHO experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be 4,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 1,000 and 9,700.There were fears that the coronavirus might spread more widely during the week-long lunar new year holidays, which start on 24 January, when millions of Chinese travel home to celebrate, but the festivities have largely been cancelled and Wuhan and other Chinese cities are in lockdown. At the moment, it appears that people in poor health are at greatest risk, as is always the case with flu. A key concern is the range of severity of symptoms – some people appear to suffer only mild illness while others are becoming severely ill. This makes it more difficult to establish the true numbers infected and the extent of transmission between people. But the authorities will be keen to stop the spread and will be anxious that the virus could become more potent than it so far appears.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The NHS advises that there is generally no need to visit a doctor for a cough unless it is persistent or you are having other symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing or you feel very unwell.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. It increases the likelihood that the World Health Organization will declare the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on Thursday evening. The key concerns are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.Healthcare workers could be at risk if they unexpectedly came across someone with respiratory symptoms who had travelled to an affected region. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.

Four people with extraordinary abilities reveal how their superpower has shaped their livesI can understand why it took so long for anyone to notice. It makes sense that the quiet, happy person in the corner gets ignored. It was only when I was in hospital for an operation on my arthritic hand – aged 65 – that the fact I can’t feel pain finally came to light.I’d only recently had a long-overdue hip replacement. “This will hurt more than the last one, you’ll need more painkillers,” the hospital anaesthetist had told me. I offered to bet any money it wouldn’t when I looked up at him with a smile.He came to see me after the procedure and I wiggled my hand in his face, proudly. “No painkillers,” I said, grinning, “and no pain either.”Down in London, I went for tests at University College Hospital. In the experiments, my husband was used as the standard – they even took a biopsy from his leg. The researchers found an abundance of a substance called anandamide in my body – so much that I never experience anxiety, fear or pain. Instead, my genes make me happy and forgetful – finally, an explanation for why it feels like every other week I lose the keys to my car.Before then I’d just assumed I was clumsy, although when I thought about it properly, lots of things began to make sense in retrospect. This explained why I often get undressed and see bruises that I’ve no recollection of acquiring why during childbirth, after some serious pushing I felt nothing more than a considerable stretch. It’s why the only way I know if I’ve burned myself while cooking is when the aroma of meat reaches my nostrils. I’m a vegan, so what I’m smelling is actually my own scorched flesh.There was even the time we went on a backpacking holiday in eastern Europe. On the first morning I fell over and went head first into a huge concrete slab. I lost my front teeth and gained a black eye – there were cuts all over my face. The family thought we’d go home, but I just whacked on my sunglasses, wrapped a scarf around my mouth, made a rule there would be no pictures of me and we carried on. They all must have just thought I was trying to be strong for them as a mum.My happy gene also makes me incredibly positive: I’m wired to look on the bright side of life. I may not feel pain, but I see it on the faces of people around me, on television. And when something sad happens in my life, of course it affects me, it’s just that the sadness doesn’t consume all I do. A few minutes later I’m thinking practically, whirring into action.That’s not to say I’m complacent. I’m outraged by injustice and can empathise with those having a tough time. But I’m practical. Vote! Protest! Do something! But don’t be a worrier, on leaving Europe or climate change or anything, really. My attitude is why waste time being a nervous wreck?I’m pretty certain my father had the same condition, although he’s no longer with us, so it’s impossible to be sure. He never complained about his war wound, and was very open-minded. There was no curfew in the evenings or restrictions on outings with boys. This British Army major would even skip alongside me on the way to school. When a brain haemorrhage killed him – without a word of warning – he just dropped down dead where he was stood.Once my test results were back, I told the research team that, of course, I’d help them. I’m no neuroscientist, but if they can isolate this gene and reproduce it to help suppress pain in others, the scientists hope to develop a natural form of pain relief. It makes me so pleased to think what the impact of that on other people might be. What’s inside me might be the secret to alleviating the suffering of others, an alternative to often addictive drugs. The funding has come through – the next phase begins in 2020.At first, the research team thought I was the only person in the world like me, but since my story went public, 80 people from across the globe have come forward to say they think they’re the same. Their bloods are being tested right now, and I’m hoping they’re correct. I’m 72 now, and it’s already taken us seven years to get this far. This could take decades. I might be an optimist, but I’m realistic – at some point they’re going to need some younger volunteers.Pick a date, any day in your life, and I can tell you what day of the week it was. Say a number, any number, and I can multiply it all day. I’m a Guinness World Record holder – the fastest human calculator. I’ve held the title for more than 20 years.I was just a regular nine-year-old pupil when my teacher wrote a list of two-digit numbers for the class to add together. My teacher could tell I wasn’t paying attention as she explained how numbers are carried over, so she decided to make an example of me by picking me out and sending me up to the board. The standard way to find the total of lots of numbers is to line them up and work downwards right to left, if you can remember. But I assumed that you could do it in the same way you read a sentence – from left to right – and found I could.By the age of 10, my maths teachers were letting me come up with ideas rather than trying to teach me. I could see all these patterns and started discovering methods of multiplication that worked.In the end I dropped out of high school. I never made it to college – I signed up to the Air Force instead. I served four years in Japan, and two in America. Then, in 1988, when my military supervisor’s son was struggling in school with maths, I was drafted in to help. I spent an evening showing the child some tricks and shortcuts, giving him a hand.The next morning I got a call from his teacher: “Who are you,” they asked me, “and what have you done?”From then, things escalated pretty quickly. I started to speak to classes fairly often, and after a reporter saw my mathematical skills firsthand and filed a story, I was invited on to television – I did the rounds.I’ve had an MRI scan. The doctor said he’d never seen a brain like mine. It’s almost as if it has a different set of wires. There’s a part of the brain called Brodmann area 44, or BA44, and mine is naturally four times the normal size. I’ve met a few other people with similar abilities at competitions: Yusnier Viera, Gerald Newport and Lee Jeonghee.For me it’s all about arithmetic, sums and numbers. I never went on to study higher level maths. I spend my life working to inspire kids to engage in the subject at that basic level, the point at which so many disconnect. That’s also how I keep myself interested – for me there’s no mental challenge in the arithmetic everyone else has to think hard for it’s all about thinking of new and exciting educational ideas.My skills used to be useful for companies. Investors, for instance, would want me to look for patterns in their trades. But since the advent of the super computer I’m a little less helpful to them. I’d have been more useful, I think, if I’d been born hundreds or even thousands of years ago.My next big thing is to get the rest of the world to use the calendar I’ve invented. I’m all about efficiency, and right now the way we measure time is a mess. Sure, we have no control over the fact there are 365 days in a year, but there’s simply no way to make that ide neatly into 12. Forget October, November and December – if you ask me, there should be 13 months in a year, each lasting 28 days, plus a zero day to kick each year off. I’m going to try and convince the world to try it out in 2023, the next time my calendar matches up with yours.Like most children, I spent my early years surrounded by music. I’ve always been blind. I was born extremely prematurely, so it is through sound that I experience the world. I had a nanny who looked after me and she tried everything she could think of to interest me. Then one day, when I was 18 months old, she had a brainwave, and retrieved a toy organ from the loft that someone had once bought in Woolworths.Of course, I don’t remember, but what my family found I could do with it was amazing. Without any help from anyone, I could play the music I’d heard, from Cockles and Mussels to the hymns that my family sang in church. Being blind, I’d never even seen anyone play the piano, but I could copy these tunes – and their accompaniments – note for note.It became obvious pretty quickly that my musical brain was wired up in an extraordinary way and, once my parents purchased a piano, I’d use everything, from my hands to my head and my elbows, to play what I could hear in my head. They soon realised that my fingers would need help to catch up.Aged four, at a school for the blind in south London called Linden Lodge, I met Adam Ockelford, who was the music teacher there, and he decided to take me under his wing. He started out by teaching me at home. He tells me I didn’t take kindly to being told what to do. I’d push him out the way and so he’d pick me up and place me in the corner of the children’s room where we practised. He’d play a tune while I found my way back to the piano and then I’d repeat what I’d heard, just like that.I loved practising and worked really hard, every day before breakfast and in the evenings. I first appeared on TV when I was only eight, in 1987, on the Derek Jameson Show. The next year, I hit the big time, playing the Pink Panther for Terry Wogan on UK national television, with an audience of millions. Suddenly, media from all over the world were interested.As a teenager I’d often get frustrated and angry, and furniture would fly. But Adam helped me channel all those emotions through music and we would improvise together for hours. Today, playing the piano isn’t just my vocation, it continues to be the key to my emotional wellbeing as well.It’s hard to explain, but any time I hear a piece of music it goes straight into my memory and stays there. I never forget a piece once I’ve heard it. My musical brain works really fast, too. When I listen to a piece, I can copy it straight away, less than half a second behind. Nobody knows how many songs I know – I certainly don’t. But it must be hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of pieces.For me, playing the piano is as easy as breathing. At a gig in a school north of Manchester a few years back I fell asleep when I was accompanying my friend Hannah Davey, the classical and jazz singer, but I carried on playing. And there doesn’t seem to be a limit on what I can learn. I memorised a full piano concerto with 11,000 notes just by listening, and played it with orchestras on the South Bank in London and in the Mainly Mozart Festival in San Diego, California.In fact, I do lots of concerts, from schools to some of the world’s great concert halls and arenas – from Taiwan to Las Vegas. I love to entertain people – the bigger the audience the more I like it. And I’ve never been nervous when I perform. I just know I can do it.People are mystified, because part of the show is when I ask the audience for requests. They can choose anything they like. As long as I’ve heard the music before, I can reproduce it, even if I’ve never played it before. If I haven’t heard it, I just ask them to play it on their phone and then I’m off. Think of a song right now and I’ll be able to play it, whatever it is.I’m much more than a musical memory machine, though. A Japanese TV company played me sounds once, very quietly: the rattle of a key in the door, a bus going past, birdsong. My heart rate jumped every time. I feel the impact of each sound emotionally. And in real life, I hear everything around me in a musical way, including words I don’t understand. So I just tend to repeat them, as though they were musical notes.I’m a person of extremes: playing the piano I find easy, but I can’t, for instance, read or write, and, aged 40, I still don’t reliably know my left from my right, so I need help with virtually all everyday tasks. But that doesn’t matter, because I’m a great people person. I love my family and friends from all over the world.I think that’s the main reason I like playing the piano – it’s my way of keeping in touch. It’s rare, if ever, that I’ll sit and play just for myself. Music is what helps me connect with others it has become my identity. I’m Derek the piano player, the entertainer. I’m Derek, the musician.Based on an interview with Derek Paravicini and Professor Adam OckelfordI remember it like it was just yesterday, the morning of 6 July 2014. It was a warm, sunny day in California – Mum and I were walking from our motel to Disneyland. I can hear the sound of laughter and music right now, the sweet smell of sugar in my nostrils as everyone rushed giddily around.My memories from the evening of 5 July 2005 are just as clear. Aged 15, I was at a concert with my sister. An usher was rude to her while I had a little meltdown. Each time I think of it the feelings of depression, anxiety and embarrassment are triggered. I’m transported right back there.In fact, I can remember every minute of every day in the finest of detail, and each time I experience the emotions I felt afresh. That’s what life with Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory, or HSAM, is like. It means, in short, that I have this ability to remember everything, but that also means my brain has no capacity to forget.At 15, I was diagnosed with autism. When that happened it was no great surprise. A year later I was told I had obsessive-compulsive disorder, but my parents and I knew there was something more. And then we saw a segment on a TV news show about HSAM. My mum recognised it in me instantly. From a very young age I would talk to her about things that had happened years before, right down to the back-and-forth of specific conversations. She always said: “Rebecca, live in the present,” while I’d always focus on the past.I can basically remember all the way back to the beginning, just after my first birthday, being held in my mum’s arms. From then on it’s every conversation, every day out, every celebration. It’s mostly entirely useless, though – like what I had for breakfast, or the most mundane of thoughts. All these memories are in chronological order, so I can work backwards or forwards. If I go back to the days before I really understood calendars, I use the image of my birthday cake and its number of candles as a reference to start. I even remember dreams – those from the first 20 minutes of sleeping. When I had my first at eight months it was quite a shock.I’ll be honest, it does get annoying. I get headaches and it causes anxiety I have to listen to music every night as I fall asleep or else I’m constantly having random flashbacks. For a long time I saw it as a curse. Slowly, as I’ve grown a little older, I’ve come to appreciate what my brain gives me. I can memorise lines, which is great for public speaking. That’s what I want to make my career, sharing my experiences with people across the world. While the sentence structures of foreign languages take some getting used to – I’ve been learning a few so I can travel – the words all just stick right away.Soon I want to put my life down on paper, the moments – big or small – that hold significance. I hope to look at how each affected my life and my future in a way few people can. And I’m starting a business, a support group for other people with autism to overcome obstacles and find their passion.Nobody is quite sure how my brain can actually hold all this information. It’s why medical researchers from Queensland to California are so keen to poke around up there. They’re attempting to discover which part of the brain is responsible for long-term memory, in the hope of finding ways to help those who are affected by Alzheimer’s, brain damage or strokes. I spend a lot of time having my brain scanned. In the initial tests I was asked to work out which day of the week random dates had been throughout my life. I’d be asked random questions and then to recall my answers five months later.I’ve spent 90 minutes in an MRI scanner that showed how the conscious and subconscious parts of my mind are more strongly connected than usual. Now they know what my brain can do, they’re more interested in studying its biology. The scientists have already discovered that the memories of people with HSAM usually get clearer with the passage of time, which is the opposite to how most people experience them.My stepdad’s father passed away a few years ago. He had suffered with Alzheimer’s, and seeing him go through it all spurred me on to do all I can to help find a cure. I like to joke that people like me are human lab rats, although we’re human lab rats who are very well cared for and loved.When I’m bored, I sometimes take myself back to a time when I worried about everything and anxiety crippled me. I think about what the 14-year-old me wished for her future, and it makes me truly appreciate the small things I now take for granted – the things I’ve achieved that might otherwise seem mundane.

She’s such a tough player. This means a lot to me.”“I did the best I could to block out the hype. I played my game and fought for every point. First set, she played some really good points at crucial moments.”Kenin, ranked 15 in the world and 42 places ahead of the fast-rising Gauff, is having the best slam of her young career - yet all the talk beforehand was about Gauff, who had beaten the defending champion, Naomi Osaka to reach the fourth round.“I just played my match,” Kenin said, “trying to win every point.” On Tuesday, she plays the unseeded Ons Jabeur – who put Johanna Konta out in the first round and, on Sunday, was too good for the Chinese world No 27, Qiang Wang, who upset Serena Williams but was powerless to stop the Tunisian winning 7-6 (4), 6-1 in an hour and 17 minutes.Gauff, whose run to the fourth round has lit up the tournament, fought hard but tired, hitting 48 unforced errors, including seven double faults, in two hours and nine minutes. Kenin, born in Moscow and raised in the United States, played with all the tenacity of her hero, Maria Sharapova.Cool and determined in a combative opening frame, she saved set point, forcing the tie-break when Gauff, going for everything but cramped on the baseline, hit a forehand long, her 19th unforced error in 50 minutes of a close, tense contest.The pressure told on Kenin in the shootout, her second double fault handing Gauff a 2-5 lead. Kenin saved the first of four set points in a sharp volley duel at close-quarters. She clipped the net to save another. Gauff gifted her the third, again overcooking a forehand, a sure sign of nerves. But she had one more in her pocket and the ball in her hand a decent serve was too hot for Kenin.Gauff, whose serve was knocking like a malfunctioning gearbox, did more than win a set of tennis she proved her mental strength. But the ride to the finish would be bumpy.Her resolve was tested further in the second set as she hit three double faults in her second service game to go with five earlier mistakes, and trailed 1-3 when she botched a volley at the net. Half an hour into the set, Kenin was 5-2 up. Gauff saved set point, stroked a beautiful forehand into empty space and held with a backhand that kissed the line.Kenin grabbed three set points – and served her fourth double fault, before levelling at a set apiece when Gauff stuck a return into the tramlines.When Kenin broke at the start of the third, the Coco fairytale looked to be unravelling like a politician’s promise. Gauff dumped a backhand to go 0-3 down, and the end beckoned. Kenin broke again, after stiff resistance, but held to love. After two hours, Gauff was serving to stay in dreamland.The Kenin winners kept flowing. She worked her way to match point – and hit a forehand into the net. She forced a second opportunity. Gauff hit long. They hugged warmly at the net, Kenin soaked up the applause, and sobbed in her chair.She was well worth the win, reaching her first slam quarter-final.In a match guaranteed to put a young American into the quarter-finals, Gauff and Kenin went about their business for intermittent stretches without the attention of their nation’s TV rights-holder, ESPN, who otherwise trained the wisdom of John McEnroe and company on Novak Djokovic’s straight-sets stroll against Diego Schwartzman.The seven-time and defending champion took just over two hours to reach the quarters for the 46th time with a routine 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 win."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cac992b5ea4a6333d8e5573f1fa1fc9353c0355c/316_0_5240_3144/master/5240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64f683edfc7cba719085198d0a2f5614","title":"sport england report bame people excluded let down","story":"Sport needs to have a “clear-sighted and honest” conversation about race, and how it can do more to help black, Asian and ethnically mixed communities be more active and involved, a major new campaign by Sport England will urge on Monday.The call comes alongside the publication of a new report – Sport For All? – which finds stubbornly low rates of participation in many BAME communities.At the launch at Villa Park on Monday, the Sport England board member Chris Grant will urge sports leaders to do more to close the “ethnicity gap”. “I’m convinced that sport must be a leader, and not a follower,” Grant will say. “That’s why I want to invite the whole of sport to come with us on this journey, and in doing so to be clear-sighted and honest about the ways in which we’re currently excluding and letting down whole swathes of our population.”“When it suits us, we’re happy to talk about the leadership role that sport can play its capacity to inspire a nation or to transform lives. But there’s an elevated level of discomfort when talking about race and culture in sport and we need to get beyond this if we are genuinely going to do something about the ethnicity gap.”The study from Sport England, based on surveys of more than 100,000 adults and children, found that while the gap exists across all ethnic groups, it is most pronounced for women of black African and Asian heritage.The new campaign seeks to lower the barriers to participation across the country and better understanding the intersectionality between issues such as ethnicity, gender, age and affluence.“As the amazing example of Ebony Horse Club shows, if you parachute a riding club into the heart of an estate in Brixton, and properly invite local young people into it, some of them will fall in love with riding,” Grant will add. “But only a few get the chance to find out where their talent could take them.“Denying and wasting talent on an industrial scale is not just morally wrong. As a nation, we also need to make the most of all the advantages at our disposal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f583b530cfa689590592d28a78ea8c913df7c3b1/189_173_3068_1841/master/3068.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d49391c4649a75c93ef4328922ebb559","title":"south africa v england fourth test day three live","story":"“Job done,” is the assessment of Alastair Cook. Even though it wasn’t a particularly convincing performance - especially from those who needed runs, not least Buttler - they are so far ahead in this Test Match that it doesn’t matter an awful lot. When we return tomorrow morning it’ll be England’s fresh bowlers striving to finish this off in style. Until then, thanks for your company. Bye!With just four minutes remaining, stumps are called on the third day. After batting again instead of enforcing the follow-on, England added 248 across two sessions. South Africa have two days to make 466. On paper, at least. In reality, their job is to hold on for long as they can and hope that rain might help them out. What a catch! du Plessis has taken a blinder at gully, the captain giving full-stretch with his right hand and puling in a blinder. It gives Hendricks a five-wicket bag on debut, finishing with 564. Fantastic work. South Africa’s target is 466. 61st over: England 248-9 (Root 58, Broad 1) Broad’s off the mark first ball, giving Root three swings at Pretorius... and he NAILS the second of them, SMASHING HIM INTO THE SECOND DECK at midwicket! That’ll do. He keeps the strike, too.Wood’s on the move before the ball is bowled but Pretorius is on target, bowling him around his legs. Of greater amusement is Root’s frustration at how long Broad is taking to reach to middle. We have nine minutes left until the close of play.60th over: England 239-8 (Root 50, Wood 18) Hendricks to Wood and he goes BANG over midwicket to start the new over, smashing him into the advertising boards. He tries to do the same again but finds the sweeper. Root tries to get in on the act, dancing down the track and swinging for the pickets... but doesn’t make contact. He’s better off standing still as he does to the next offering, timing a gorgeous cover drive through the gap for four. That’ll make a lovely photo, making contact with the ball as his back knee touched the turf. With another single to finish, England’s captain moves to another half-century from his 90th ball in the middle. That’s a 50 in both innings and his 65th score above 50 in Test cricket.59th over: England 229-8 (Root 45, Wood 13) There we go! 15 from Pretorius’ over, Wood once again providing the entertainment. Not quite as emphatic as yesteday with his Maxwell-esque slaps over point, but two outside edges give him two boundaries. I’m probably being unfair with the first of those - was more a steer. TV tells us that he has 90 runs for the series (once out) and a bowling average of 13.From Joachim Demnitz. “My wife: 55, Me: 66, our son: 99, our daughter due: 1111 but because of a mix-up of scanning pictures the doctors recommended and indeed delivered by caesarian on 1911.” Missed it by that much! Adam Hirst, too: “England seem to be playing this like a 4-day test? Hitting out to get quick runs before a declaration and an hour to bowl. I think they want an extra day off at the finish of the series.” Home a day early after a massive night out, I suspect... usually the incentive.58th over: England 214-8 (Root 41, Wood 3) Will Mark Wood add to his tally of sixes? He smacked five last week and three in the first innings. Until then, he only had eight in his entire First Class career. Nup, not here: Hendricks looks to have learned his lesson yesterday about feeding him in his slot outside the off-stump.“Hi Adam.” Hi, Eva Maaten. “I love the way the OBO gets hijacked by fascinating, though cricket unrelated topics! My grandmother was born on 18.9, my mother on 17.9, my sister on 16.9. I was supposed to arrive on 12.9. but decided to be early (8.9) and nd my daughter was due on 22.2.02. She didn’t fancy that date, though. Greetings from the sunny and pleasant Wanderers.” You’re right, this has been fun!On the same theme, Ant Pease has an solution for us. “To answer Chris McMillan, the chance of two people sharing a birthday in 1365, so the chance of them both sharing that with another person is (1365)^2 or about 1 in 133,000.”Brian Withington had a go at it too: “Ignoring leap years and assuming only one child born in generations two and three, I make the odds of all three generations sharing the same birthday some 133,224-1. The first birthday is a given so we are only talking about squaring 365 and subtracting 1.” Great work, both of you.57th over: England 209-8 (Root 40, Wood 0) Well, if Root is going to declare - and let’s assume he needs to do it in the next couple of overs to make it worthwhile tonight - it didn’t look like it during this Pretorius over. Three from it.“Why do England persist with Jos Buttler in the Test team and overlook Ben Foakes?” asks John Graham. “What did Foakes do wrong?”I have a few emails like this. I’d just offer the context that it was for Bairstow, really, that Foakes lost his spot. It’s only been since YJB lost his way with the bat that Buttler was given the gloves back. I share your view about Foakes. I would have kept all three in there at the point when he was doing so well. They are a fair way from being able to justify that now though, the other two both out of runs.“Night shift in Australia and thank God there’s the blog to follow.” Great to have you with us, Scott Probst. “I’ve got to admit I’m behind the news, but it was alarming to see musing earlier about South African cricket being in decline…. I wouldn’t have thought this was possible given the talent they seem to have at their disposal.” Yes, there’s going to be a lot of important words written about this over the next few months, I suspect. It’s both sudden and serious. There’s a lot going on.A little inside edge and that’s Woakes gone second ball. Hendricks has four. This has been a most commendable perfomance from the entire South African attack.Fun while it lasted. Curran was given a bouncer and there was never any doubt about him taking it on with just one man out there for it. But he’s picked out that fielder, slotting a top-edged hook straight down the throat of Patterson. 55th over: England 205-6 (Root 38, Curran 35) Pretorius returns and Curran is very keen on that, getting down the wicket and slapping him through the line with contempt. He’s 35 from 26 balls and batting like a dream. Earlier in the over, England reached 200 and pushed their lead beyond the highest successful fourth innings chase of 418, which the West Indies made against Australia in 2003. Ian Forth returning to an earlier topic: “A parachuted then dropped X!: Carberry, Lathwell, Balderstone, David Smith, Chris Cowdrey, Hamilton, Read, Selvey, Borthwick, Pattinson, Rankin.”From an Australian perspective, I’d throw Callum Ferguson and Joe Mennie in. Both were brought in for the Hobart all-out 80 debacle, never to be seen again.54th over: England 198-6 (Root 36, Curran 30) Another delightful Curran boundary, hammering Hendricks’ first delivery through midwicket. It wasn’t even that short he’s just so organised square of the wicket. With that in the bank, they are happy collecting runs around the field for the rest as though we’re watching an ODI. It increasingly looks like they are going to pull the trigger on this declaration.A note from Scott Roberts on Jos. “You took the words right out of my fingers with your analysis of how Jos should play in this situation, one which should be tailormade for him to perform in a free, Gilchrist-esque attacking mode. Like you, though, I suspect that Jos knows he’s playing for his place, which is something I assume Gilchrist never had to worry about.”Is there anything wrong with simply resting him for Sri Lanka? I mean, they will want Foakes for wicketkeeping reasons. Fair enough. They need Jos fresh for the T20 World Cup campaign - and he has the IPL in April and the home summer. If after all of that he can command a Test spot again as a specialist bat, then what a good result that would be. And if he can’t, then is it that big a deal? 53rd over: England 190-6 (Root 35, Curran 23) Paterson has done plenty right at Root, beating his outside edge, finding his inside edge and generally making life difficult for him. But it comes to nothing. He goes up for a chat with the England skipper at the end of the over. Funnily enough, we can’t hear it on stump mic.52nd over: England 186-6 (Root 33, Curran 21) Sam Curran, everyone! Hendricks gives him a chance to swing his arms early in the over so he does just that, pulling four over midwicket, a couple of bounces before tricking over the rope. Later in the set he plays another lavish stroke off the back foot, Root-esque through extra cover with supreme timing. With it, England’s lead moves beyond 400. Still some chance of a declaration tonight with 50 minutes left to play. I reckon they’ll do it.“Hi Adam.” Gidday, Chris McMillan. “Whilst we are talking about birth date anomalies, I wonder if I could crowd-source some stats work that I’m too lazy to do myself? My son was 4 days short of being born on my birthday - which I share with my dad. What would the odds of 3 generations all being born on the same day?” Very Sunday-arvo-third-innings-declaration-runs-OBO-areas, right there.Tom Whitaker on the same topic. “My best friend and I had our children within an hour of each other’s. His son is 42 minutes older than my daughter. It’s like a Pulp song.” Beautiful. One of my best friends is due six weeks after we are we know each other from indie dancefloors and have spent months saying to each other that in about 16 years there is a strong likelihood of Disco 2000 happening.51st over: England 176-6 (Root 33, Curran 11) Paterson is straight into it again at Root, finding an inside edge that whacks him on the unprotected part of his back knee. That hurts. This isn’t at all problematic for England in this match given their big first innings lead but this second innings really has been a scrap so far.“An OBO quiz question for a sleepy afternoon,” writes Tom Bowtell. Okay, let’s do it. “With so many members of the 10,000+ Test runs club retiring over the last few years, I was wondering which current player *who hasn’t retired from Tests* has the most runs?” Good question! It must be none other than the England captain, with Smith and Kohli both within 300-odd runs away from catching up to him. 50th over: England 172-6 (Root 31, Curran 9) Is that Sam Curran or Brian Lara? With just a tiny bit of length to worth with, he’s slapping Nortje through cover with a straight blade, on the up. A beautiful stroke. But reinforcing that he isn’t, indeed, Brian Charles (or anything like the finished product), he gets a fat outside edge from the next ball, lucky not to be walking off as a result of the loose shot. “Century in a session” begins Andy Cox, grumpy what I forecast something special from Stokes when he came out batting like a dream. “Stop it - we’ve got enough superstitious nonsense in English cricket without needing help from Australians! PS I love The Final Word, but any more of this commentators curse on our batters and I might have to consider some serious retaliation. Like unsubscribing. Or giving a 1-star rating. Or both. You’ve been warned.”Thanks, I think! As I’ll always remind you what it comes to curses, it is Mitch Marsh who I have burned on the OBO and radio more than any other. Lucky for me, he’s the best fella in cricket and doesn’t have it in him to hold a grudge.49th over: England 163-6 (Root 30, Curran 1) Curran is on a King Pair, of course. He’s through that, defending Paterson into the legside. I know he’s already 30, but there’s quite a lot to like about the new seamer, isn’t there? Very accurate, nice natural shape and has a quick enough bumper to keep things interesting. As for Slammin’ Sam, he’s off the mark and off his pair with one to backward point. Root has one ball to get through and he’s pinged on the glove. Very good bowling.Before Jos fell, I was about to give you a Mac Millings offering. Let’s go with it anyway. “In the 7th over of this innings, a certain Tom Parker said he couldn’t rid himself of a ‘Ghostbusters’ earworm, featuring ‘Jos Buttler!’ and ‘I ain’t ‘fraid of Ben Foakes’. I am here to help.”Let it rip...If there’s Nass Hussain in your “Neigh!” Mark Wood,Younis Bonnor Hall?Jos Buttler!Griffith Lumb Singh BeardPandit don’t Cook WoodYounis Bonnor Hall?Jos Buttler!I ain’t ‘fraid of Ben FoakesI ain’t ‘fraid of Ben FoakesGifford, Lee \u0026amp SinghSunny Stew Cork Head(Bis)hoo Kanhai Hall?Jos Buttler!Khan Vish Habibul MannSleep Maninder Fred,Younis Bonnor Hall?Jos Buttler!Hands thrown, edge found. “The type of shot you can play at England,” says Athers, “but at the Wanderers the sort of shot that can get you in trouble.”48th over: England 160-6 (Root 28) And drinks are on the field.47th over: England 157-5 (Root 27, Buttler 6) Jos is back on strike and tries to once again time a ball on the up through over. The problem was, it landed only a couple of metres in front of the catcher now positioned for that very shot. This is such a tough spot for Buttler to be in. Does he just go for it? But at what cost if it doesn’t work out? Is he more effective in that mode anyway? Whatever it takes, I suppose. I reckon it’s fair to conclude that he’s just about batting for his Test career.“Michael Carberry’s being in that Ashes team (41st over) enabled Geoff Lemon, on OBO debut, to describe a drinks break with: ‘Carbo hydrates’,” says Smylers. “Maybe it was worth dropping him just to avoid any repeat offending?” The old OBO format! And what a great memory you have. 46th over: England 156-5 (Root 26, Buttler 6) “Game within a game here,” says Nasser as Buttler takes guard. Indeed it is. Just as it was with Denly before tea. A big shout first ball! Nortje likes it for leg before du Plessis fancies that he might have found an inside edge, taken by the captain on the deflection at second slip. The umpire keeps his finger down a sigh of relief for the England ‘keeper. The TV replay shows that it wasn’t out on either front, comfortably going over the top. Right, he’s off the mark with a couple to midwicket. One to come in the successful over and away it runs for four through cover! That’s Buttler at his best, timing the socks off a delivery just short of a length, bisecting two fielders. Glorious! Eventful!That was nearly how Pope got himself into bother a couple of overs ago and this time it has brought his demise, cutting too close to his body and instead edging straight into the gloves of de Kock. That’s his 200th dismissal in Test cricket. 45th over: England 146-4 (Root 26, Pope 7) Pretorius gives Root a couple to clip before landing the rest in a shoebox just on or outside the off-stump. But what du Plessis would give for Maharaj right now, I suspect.44th over: England 144-4 (Root 24, Pope 7) They are asking KP on the to comment on Pope and sure enough, the No6 plays a magnificent on-drive for four. “An exhibition of playing that shot,” he says. It’s off Nortje too, the quickest of the bowlers, which seems to have suited him through the series. It’s a long way away - and is far from the be all and end all - but it’s easy to understand why England fans see this kid play and immediately think about how he’s going to go in Australia two years from now. Now I’ve written that, there was nothing more certain than him playing a rash shot, edging a late cut just short of du Plessis at second slip. 43rd over: England 138-4 (Root 23, Pope 2) A far more more chilled out environment now that Stokes has been and gone. Pope clips a single. He’s clearly a smart young player so I don’t expect anything rash from him. A red inker, perhaps.“My kid Ellis was born in 2017 on my birthday, 2nd February, and will forever be stealing my thunder. Next weekend is our 44th birthday!” Nice one, Ben Roberts. If we’re ten days early (whatever that means) we’ll be joining you on that date. “Good luck with Feb 12,” adds Peter Salmon. “The birthday of my favourite ever cricketer, Gundappa Viswanath. Used to have great fun and boring parties interjecting with ‘Did you know I once shared a taxi with Gundappa Viswanath?’ It was a lie, but the party always went to a new and strange place, generally starting with the question ‘Who is Gundappa Viswanath?’ A tip for the listeners there.”I hadn’t thought of checking 122 (or 22) cricketers! I found a morbib 1221920 birthdate in my travels but I should, as people always say on twitter, stick to sport. 42nd over: England 137-4 (Root 23, Pope 1) The new man is happy enough in defence until the final delivery, pulling Hendricks out to backward square to get off the mark and keep the strike to end the successful over.“Sibley might be mightily miffed but he now has a Test batting average of40.22,” notes Romeo. “This is an England opener we’re talking about.” Indeed.Good from Hendricks to stick to his plan outside the off-stump at Stokes, rewarded when the all-rounder tried to bully him through extra cover. With the outside edge found, RvdD claims a straightforward catch at slip. Fun cameo.41st over: England 135-3 (Root 22, Stokes 28) Easy pickings for Root, given a full toss on his pads from Pretorius, putting it away without a bother. The all-rounder is back on the mark after that, finding the outside part of Root’s bat, played with soft hands for one. It gives Stokes a chance and his innovation gets him four! Not from the blade but byes after leaping across his stumps to paddle but missing the ball - with de Kock up to the stumps, he had almost no chance of stopping it. Four more to finish, Stokes this time carving out past backward point and beating the sweeper. Find a telly, the big redhead is on one. 13 from the over the lead is 352.“After yesterday’s ‘what might have been’ team talk, I was wondering if we could form a ‘dropped into impossible England situations and then getting dropped as a result’ team.” I like this, Adam Simpson. “Going back to the 80s, I’d pick Chris Cowdrey captaining an ostensibly new England ‘team’ against the Windies in 1988 after everyone had been dropped for being a bit crap. A latter days choice would be Michael Carberry for being just about the best player on that Ashes tour and being dumped as a result.”Yes, Carberry is my nomination there. I still can’t believe he was sacked. 40th over: England 122-3 (Root 17, Stokes 24) Is it too early for me to say... century in a session? Probably, but I’ll look clever later on if it plays out that way. Sure enough, Stokes is on the attack against Hendricks again, driving him down the ground with tremendous class, to the long-on rope this time. Beautiful batting. He tries to hook to finish and there’s a noise before the ball lands with de Kock but the umpire is unmoved. So is the technology when the TV take a second look at it.“Hello from Perth, Adam” Hello to you, Laurence Davison.” My wife’s due date and eventual delivery fell a few days either side of 121212. I love my son and everything but I still kind of think he should have made the effort to pop out a little earlier. Good luck!” Thanks! Yes, I’ve relayed this to the bump. Are they listening? And I wonder what they make of Mark Nicholas’ soothing voice?

Two of them were contractors who are in Guantánamo Bay this week to give evidence. The third has still not been identified 17 years after the torture was committed.In the courtroom of the military commission, the CIA officer was referred to only by three-digit code NZ7, or simply as “the Preacher” – a nickname he was given because of his peculiar way of terrorising detainees.According to James Mitchell, a psychologist on contract to the CIA who helped draft and apply their “enhanced interrogation techniques”, the Preacher “would at random times put one hand on the forehead of a detainee, raise the other high in the air, and in a deep Southern drawl say things like, ‘Can you feel it, son? Can you feel the spirit moving down my arm, into your body?’”Mitchell gave that chilling description in his memoir, Enhanced Interrogation, and on the witness stand on Thursday, he confirmed the Preacher’s role at the CIA black sites. He was giving evidence at a pre-trial hearing in the case against five defendants charged for the 911 al-Qaida attacks, including the self-styled mastermind, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.Mitchell, together with his friend and business partner, Bruce Jessen – who is due to testify next week – have been the public face of the US torture programme for five years, settling out of court in 2017 in a civil suit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of three prisoners.Almost everyone else involved in the extensive programme, involving a network of black sites around the world, has remained in the shadows. In terms of legality, it is still the dark side of the moon.Defence lawyers at the Guantánamo military commission hearings have asked to examine 52 witnesses. They have so far been permitted to question only two, Mitchell and Jessen.James Connell, representing defendant Ammar al-Baluchi, lost his patience on Thursday when prosecutors objected that he was asking Mitchell about events he had not directly witnessed.“He’s the only witness we’ve got. The government has blocked all the CIA witnesses,” Connell complained.Four days before the current pre-trial hearing, the 40th in eight years of legal skirmishes, the prosecution changed the classification rules, and amended them again on Monday on the evening before the first open session. As a result, some facts that were previously unclassified, in published books for example, were reclassified, sending defence attorneys scrambling to reframe their planned line of questioning.The longer the hearings have continued, the clearer it has become that the Mitchell and Jessen partnership was just a small part of the infrastructure of torture, with its own bureaucracy and personal rivalries. In his testimony, Mitchell railed repeatedly against the “middle management” who he believed was plotting against him.Mitchell became embroiled in a vicious turf war with a rival, the CIA chief of interrogations, for mastery of the “enhanced programme”. Each sought to use their links to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, to get the other removed from their post. In that struggle the detainees were used as bargaining counters. The two men had them tortured for training or demonstration purposes.In the courtroom this week, the interrogations chief has been referred to by the code NX2. Mitchell calls him the “new sheriff”, but it has been reported his real name was Charlie Wise, who had honed his craft carrying out interrogations for the Contra rebels in Nicaragua in the 1980s. He apparently died of a heart attack in 2003, just weeks after being dismissed.According to declassified cables and courtroom testimony, Wise set up his own training programme, and took his students to a black site in Afghanistan, codenamed Cobalt, to practise their techniques on Ammar al-Baluchi and other prisoners. During that training, Baluchi was repeatedly slammed against a wall, suffering brain trauma as a result.“Looks like they used your client as a training prop,” Mitchell told Connell. A newly declassified paragraph in a secret CIA inspector general report quotes one of the students as saying the site was used for “on-the-job training”. Trainees had to use each of their techniques on Baluchi and other inmates in order to earn certification.An unsanctioned, improvised waterboard was also set up at the Cobalt site, according to defence lawyers. It does not seem to have been part of the training, but it was used on at least one detainee.The CIA was forced to close down its first main interrogation centre in Thailand in late 2002 when its existence was discovered by the New York Times. The “high value detainees” were transferred by rendition flights to a new site in Poland, codenamed Blue, which was run by Wise.Mitchell visited Blue shortly before Christmas in 2002, and testified he witnessed at least two extreme techniques that had not been approved by the CIA or the justice department. In one, a piece of wooden dowel was put behind the knees of a detainee who was made to kneel and then had his back forced back “until his shoulder blades were touching the floor”.In another, the prisoner’s elbows were strapped together with a strap behind his back and his hands were raised above his head. Fearing the torture would cause permanent injury, Mitchell said he tried to stop it but was told “it was none of my fucking business”.When the contractor declared he wanted to return to the US, Wise told him he was not allowed to leave, Mitchell claimed. Nor could Mitchell contact the outside world as all communications equipment at the site were locked up. For a week he was a prisoner of his rival, he said.Mitchell said he was finally permitted to go home because the tension inside the site began damaging morale. On his return he said he complained to the CIA leadership but to no avail. Wise stayed in his job and Mitchell found he was giving courses at headquarters including the banned techniques more than four months later. The chief of interrogation was only fired that summer.Throughout his testimony this week, Mitchell has portrayed himself as a moderate who stuck to the rules and only used extreme measures when he felt he had no choice.He tried to halt waterboarding of the first major detainee, Abu Zubaydah, in August 2002, arguing that the prisoner was fully cooperating, but his superiors in Langley ordered told him and his team in the original black site in Thailand to “stay the course”.In an effort to win the argument, he said he persuaded the head CIA officer in the country to witness a waterboarding for himself.“I wanted the chief of station to experience what we were experiencing,” Mitchell said. “It didn’t smell pleasant. It smelled like sweat – kinda musky.”He also conceded he and Jessen were beginning to feel a bit exposed. They realised they were the only ones in the interrogation room not wearing a mask, and the torture was being videoed.The station chief turned up to watching Abu Zubaydah being waterboarded, but dressed as a guard, his face coveredWhen his superiors insisted he persevere in Thailand, he told them to send a delegation to witness the simulated drowning.“Buddy – you want it,” Mitchell told them. “Bring your rubber boots and come on down.”When the senior officials flew in, on 17 August, he waterboarded Abu Zubaydah even though he was quite sure the detainee had no actionable intelligence to surrender. It was done purely as a demonstration for the agency VIPs. And he applied the technique to the maximum extent allowed, pouring water on to a cloth on the prisoner’s face for 20 seconds and then a full 40 seconds. According to a CIA cable describing the event, Abu Zubaydah went into spasm.The visitors were stunned. “Some of the folks were tearful,” Mitchell said.“I was tearful, but I cry at dog food commercials,” Mitchell claimed. The psychologist’s eyes did indeed well up on a few occasions during his testimony this week, but the tears came when he was describing what he saw as his personal sacrifices. In contrast, he described waterboarding dispassionately, characterising it as “temporary discomfort”.“Does he care more about dog food commercials than he cares about human beings?” asked Terry Rockefeller, who was watching Mitchell’s testimony this week from the military commission’s public gallery on the other side of a reinforced glass partition.Her sister, Laura, was killed in the attacks on the World Trade Centre. She was an actress who just happened to be working in the twin towers in New York on September 11, 2001, on a day job hosting a business seminar on risk assessment.Terry is a member of a relatives’ group called September Eleventh Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, which is seeking justice for the attacks but opposes the use of the death penalty.“The fact that he can talk about something like waterboarding in such clinical terms ... That’s just crushing to me, because my country did it and because I feel a great loss,” Rockefeller said, pointing out that the use of torture against the defendants has vastly complicated the process of putting them on trial."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af045af4dea48470df76623caff7896e27a37e60/0_234_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9be0046a41f69a2e84f3dd59c08b9b62","title":"pete buttigieg iowa rallies is america ready for a gay president","story":"Jerry Pinneke is backing Pete Buttigieg for president despite himself. The retired engineer, who worked in the US, Brazil and the UK, likes the Indiana mayor’s youth, is impressed by his ability to speak eight languages, including Norwegian and Dari, and calls him a natural leader. But he has had to set one issue aside.“I’m a homophobe,” said Pinneke after attending a Buttigieg rally in Ankeny, Iowa, as campaigning in the first vote to select the Democratic presidential candidate heads into the final stretch before the state’s caucus on 3 February. “I get around gay people, that isn’t the world that I grew up in and it bothers me.”Pinneke, 71, said he will vote for the gay military veteran despite his own prejudice, although he flinches at the thought of a President Buttigieg with his husband, Chasten, as First Gentleman.“I grapple with that. But so what? Does it hurt anybody? I haven’t seen it. So why is that an issue for me? Is it because I’m an old son-of-a-gun and I didn’t grow up that way? That’s not a good reason not to vote for him,” he said.But Pinneke is not alone in wondering if others might fail to set their prejudices aside, and whether that makes Buttigieg, a 38-year-old Harvard graduate, Rhodes scholar and former US navy intelligence officer who served in Afghanistan, a risky bet as a presidential candidate.The South Bend mayor has blazed an impressive streak into the Democratic primaries as an unknown from a small midwestern city. When campaigning kicked off last year, the mantle of youthful upstart was held by the Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke, who arrived in Iowa bolstered by nearly snatching Ted Cruz’s seat in the US Senate. But O’Rourke quickly burned out, as voters were turned off by a lack of substance behind the show.In contrast, Buttigieg’s relentless campaigning won over voters, with his upbeat message, military background and, for some, his religious faith. He positioned himself as a more youthful Joe Biden in favour of incremental change in contrast to the more radical platforms of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. His star climbed and so did his poll numbers until, by November, Buttigieg was the frontrunner in Iowa. But since then, he has fallen back, as voters focus on the fraught question of who is the best candidate to beat Trump.A CNN poll last week showed all four of the leading Iowa candidates beating Trump in the general election, but Buttigieg was ahead by the slimmest margin. In Iowa, he remains very much in contention, within a percentage point of Sanders and Warren. But nationally he trails his main rivals badly.Debates about electability have flared up periodically in American history. The political establishment questioned if a Catholic could win the White House when John F Kennedy ran in 1960. Barack Obama’s campaign was accompanied by plenty of speculation as to whether the US was ready for its first black president, a question answered decisively by the voters.This month’s bitter confrontation in a televised debate over what Sanders said to Warren in private about the prospects for a woman to be elected president revived chatter over whether gender is an additional obstacle. Hillary Clinton’s defeat of Donald Trump by nearly 3 million in the popular vote, only to be robbed of the presidency by the vagaries of the electoral college, would say not.The issue hasn’t entirely been laid to rest. Warren has faced questions from women at her rallies about whether her gender will be a disadvantage, with Trump stalking the debate stage.Buttigieg’s sexuality is a more awkward question for some Democrats. They do not want to feed prejudice at a time when the US is more tolerant toward the LGBTQ community than ever. Support for same-sex marriage has flipped from two-to-one against 15 years ago to the reverse today. As attitudes have evolved, institutions have followed, from the scrapping of the prohibition on publicly identifying as LGBTQ in the military to the supreme court’s ruling in favour of marriage equality.But for those calculating who would be the best candidate to get the man they regard as the worst president of modern times out of the White House, there is a nagging fear that Buttigieg’s sexuality could cost him votes if he were the candidate, and let Trump back in.Only half of American voters said they were ready for a gay president, according to a poll for Politico in October. Just a quarter of voters thought their neighbours would support a LGBTQ president – a statistic that feeds into concerns among some Democratic primary voters that, while they personally have no problem with Buttigieg, others might. That in turn makes voters like Janet Jalbert nervous.“I think we would have more trouble right now accepting a gay man and having a First Gentleman in the White House than we would a woman president,” said Jalbert, a post office worker and undecided voter, at a Warren rally. “Between Warren and Buttigieg, I would go with Pete. However, I believe Elizabeth probably has a stronger chance just because of the way the world is right now. Old-school people. And that’s the only thing he has going against him. It’s not his sexuality. It’s people with closed minds.”Jalbert said the concern that Buttigieg’s sexuality might diminish the anti-Trump vote was enough for her to shy away from supporting him.“Now, if he were to become vice president, I think that would be a great way to get him in there. And then people could see what it was all about,” she said.At a Sanders rally the following day, Ashly Moore, an occupational therapist, expressed a similar sentiment. “I like Pete but I do have concerns that he could not be as electable because of who he loves,” she said.Last July, that concern was reinforced by the findings of a focus group of black Democratic primary voters in South Carolina, questioned for the Buttigieg campaign. He does poorly in the south in general but particularly among African Americans.“Being gay was a barrier for these voters, particularly for the men who seemed uncomfortable even discussing it,” said the report leaked to the State newspaper in Columbia, South Carolina.The report said that was not necessarily a red line to voting for him “but their preference is for his sexuality to not be front and center”.One man told the focus group: “I’ll go ahead and say it. I don’t like the fact that he threw out there that he lives with his husband.” A woman described Buttigieg speaking about Chasten as “too much information”.Johnnie Cordero, the chair of the black caucus for South Carolina Democrats, told the New York Times that he met Buttigieg to discuss the issue. “To be honest with you, it’s going to be a problem. I know he knows that because we’ve discussed it,” Cordero said. “My advice to him was, don’t flaunt it.”Still, some supporters of rival candidates do not think it is an issue. At the Warren rally, Dylan Baker said the question of sexuality and electability had come up in family discussions.“My dad’s a Democrat. He’s leaning to Biden but he also really likes Pete Buttigieg and we were talking about this question of electability and I was saying him being gay will not affect people’s voting. He said: ‘Oh, yeah, I forgot he was gay.’” Baker paused and then added: “But maybe that will affect things. We’re never past those sorts of things.”Buttigieg has sought to defuse the issue with some black voters who oppose same-sex marriage on religious grounds by drawing parallels between the struggle for gay rights and the challenges facing other minorities. He has also said that once people get to know him they will get over the fact that he is married to a man, an assertion borne out by the focus-group report, which noted that “after seeing the mayor speak, most voters … seemed to be able to get past his sexual orientation”.Bob Sohm, a Buttigieg supporter at a rally in Sioux City, Iowa, agreed with that. “People have their prejudices but it can be done. We’ve never elected a black president until now. It’s got to start somewhere.“I think it’s just people need to be more educated about him and know his policies, and maybe think ‘I can start to consider this guy because maybe he can win’.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d2c00a799679370cd3579ef9ed9a91d652e4195/26_38_3396_2038/master/3396.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a329304f3af7db06572b06c11e96dcb9","title":"matteo salvini vows evict government if far right wins italy regional polls","story":"League leader hopes to secure political comeback via votes in Emilia-Romagna and CalabriaThe far-right Italian politician Matteo Salvini has threatened to “evict” the national government if his coalition triumphs in two regional elections.The former deputy prime minister, whose party was ejected from government last summer after he failed to force snap elections, has flouted campaign silence rules with a flurry of tweets.Emilia-Romagna and Calabria are both led by the centre-left Democratic party (PD), which formed a precarious national alliance with the Five Star Movement (M5S) in September after Salvini’s unsuccessful gambit.Polls before the blackout period began gave Salvini’s group, which includes the smaller far-right Brothers of Italy and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia, a clear lead in Calabria.The race in Emilia-Romagna is much tighter, with the League’s candidate, Lucia Borgonzoni, neck and neck with the PD’s incumbent regional president, Stefano Bonaccini.However, a defeat for the PD there would be more crushing as the region has been a leftwing bastion since the end of the second world war.Triumphs for Salvini’s coalition would further destabilise the PD-M5S alliance and could lead to a government collapse, as it would probably increase tensions between the coalition partners, with more MPs from both defecting as their faith in the alliance dwindles.That could bring forward general elections that would favour the League, given its leading position in national polls.The resignation of Luigi Di Maio as M5S leader last week has added to the turmoil and Nicola Zingaretti, who leads the PD, may also come under pressure to quit if his party loses the regional votes.Salvini and Meloni have led energetic campaigns across both regions, with their pledges to defend Catholic values, repel unwanted immigration, increase security and cut taxes resonating widely.“If you give us a hand, on Monday we’ll go and ask for early elections to give this country a strong, coherent government,” Meloni said at a closing rally in Ravenna, Emilia-Romagna, on Friday.The League has already made serious inroads in the region as voters switched allegiances in recent years, managing to capture several small towns before winning its first major city, Ferrara, last June.The Salvini coalition also came first in Emilia-Romagna in national elections in 2018 and again in European parliamentary elections last May.The League’s latest campaign has featured familiar toxic traits, with Salvini sparking an outcry after marching up to a block of flats on the outskirts of Bologna last week and, encouraged by laughing supporters, ringing the bell of a Tunisian family’s home to ask over the intercom if they were drug dealers. At the same time, he has posed for selfies with African immigrants who he claimed were supporters.Many say the League’s true rival in Emilia-Romagna is the Sardines, a movement that emerged in Bologna in mid-November in reaction to Salvini’s threat to “liberate” the region from the left. The movement has managed to mobilise thousands to demonstrations across the country. “The real match is between the Sardines and Salvini,” Mattia Santori, one of the movement’s founders, said on Thursday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63ea6c886519ce7a139cde51d39fe7935b81655c/0_329_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dc15137730ee61c05489fba9f549ffb","title":"netflix tv drama ares netherlands student fraternities initiation rituals","story":"As the Netherlands-set Netflix series shows, initiation rituals lie at the heart of secret societies“Have you ever wondered how a country as small as the Netherlands became so rich and powerful?” The question is posed in the first episode of Ares, the first Dutch original series made for Netflix, released earlier this month.The show draws on the mysterious world of student fraternities, telling the story of undergraduates Rosa and Jacob as they are seduced into the secretive society Ares, a cruel and elitist world where evil deeds are rewarded with power. While the dramatic twists and turns might be confined to the screen, the secretive society setting is based on a very real phenomenon: powerful student fraternities that promise members a wealth of friends, parties and connections in exchange for their loyalty. The real-life Dutch societies have repeatedly been hit by scandals over cruel initiation ceremonies and bacchanals of drinking that have led to serious injuries and even death. The biggest societies – such as Veritas in Utrecht, Augustinus in Leiden, and Albertus Magnus of Groningen – are steeped in Latin terminology, symbols and ritual, and operate from gilded 19th-century mansions they have owned for generations.“The fraternities are breeding grounds for politicians, for banks – the people with power still mainly come from those places,” said Michael Leendertse, the head of development for Ares. He described a key genesis of the story emerging from a conversation with his partner. “My girlfriend is of mixed heritage, like our main character Rosa, and she also joined a fraternity.” Fraternity members are often wary of speaking to journalists after scandals in the Dutch press. In 2016 students in Amsterdam and Groningen were admitted to hospital after initiations that including jumping in canals, sleeping on rubbish and a fresher’s head being stood on by a senior fraternity member. Members of Groningen’s Vindicat – which once required initiates to sign a contract agreeing to pay €25,000 if they disclosed initiation activities – were found to have circulated a “bang list” of female freshers, complete with photos, phone numbers, addresses and ratings.A former Vindicat member who spoke to the Observer on condition of anonymity said the “hardcore” of the fraternities is an old Dutch elite with family links going back generations, surrounded by newcomers who aspire to be part of that world.“People were singled out for different gradations of humiliation,” he said of the initiation ceremonies. “I had to stand up during dinner and tell a funny story to the crowd. Older members were standing over me and telling me it was not funny. There are other things, like cleaning the street with toothbrushes. It’s quite tough not to feel humiliated and to keep seeing it as a game.” The University of Groningen refused accreditation and funding to Vindicat in 2018, but it insists it has now cleaned up its act.One senior current member of a fraternity, who as a member of its board wears a special tie and business dress daily, defended secret initiation practices as forming bonds that help with networking throughout life. “If you meet someone on the other side of the world from your fraternity, you have that bond with them, because you know you both went through the same thing,” the board member said. He added that, as a student not from an elite background, rising to the top of the fraternity had offered him opportunities otherwise closed to him. In his early 20s, he already has a steering hand in an organisation with a turnover of well over a million euros a year, made up of membership fees, university subsidies, ticket revenues and prodigious sales of beer.The drama in Ares revolves around the competition between students to land a prestigious internship with a prominent alumna. Fraternities come with real-life access too: amid shortages of student housing, many of the best rooms are in fraternity-only accommodation. “Once a house becomes a fraternity house, it stays a fraternity house,” said 18-year-old medical student Julian, who occupies a room in a sprawling fin de siècle mansion in Groningen that has been passed down to Albertus Magnus members since 1995.Ares takes this exclusivity to an extreme. One scene shows a dinner beneath Rembrandt’s The Night Watch in Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum, as Ares members point out their ancestors in the painting. Lingering shots of old trading ships, chains and the spoils of empire hint at a dark truth beneath the opulence which bursts to the surface in a bloody and enigmatic finale.“We took the idea of a fraternity and made it even bigger – a fictional society that goes back to a dark and bloody past,” Leendertse said. “There we found the key to the entire series.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4151930.1580052350!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"it s survival of the fittest dublin cycling campaign urges safety measures","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe  Dublin Cycling Campaign protesters pass by Capel Street along the Liffey quays on Sunday morning. Photograph: Alan Betson More than 250 cyclists took to the banks of the river Liffey on Sunday morning calling for the implementation of the proposed cycle plan along one of the busiest stretches of road in Dublin’s city centre.Cyclists of all ages took part in the protest, organised by the Dublin Cycling Campaign, moving from Grand Canal Square down the Liffey quays as far as the Dublin City Council offices before turning back along the north side of the river.In April 2019 it was announced that a 5km cycle path from the Phoenix Park to the Tom Clarke Bridge had finally been selected by the National Transport Authority (NTA) after seven years of planning for the project. However, it emerged late last year that the estimated completion date was 2024.Dublin Cycling Campaign says Dublin City Council and the NTA must introduce temporary measures along the Liffey route in the interim to protect cyclists.Custom House bollards“We’ve seen the city council put in temporary measures in other places they have bollards in front of the Custom House already,” says Kieran Ryan from the cycling campaign. “That same approach of temporary measures will create some semblance of a safe cycle route until we get around to building the proper infrastructure.”At present, most of the Liffey quays area is dedicated to motorists, placing cyclists commuting along the river at real risk, said Mr Ryan. “For someone cycling, they’re sharing a lane with buses and taxis and then outside the bus lane you’re dealing with more traffic. It’s a lot of people constrained into a small space, all vying for a position, and when you’re on a bike you’re the most vulnerable.“I don’t want to scare people but it really is survival of the fittest when you’re cycling along the quays.”The new government must ensure 10 per cent of the transport budget is dedicated to cycling infrastructure, said Mr Ryan. “We don’t have to always talk about Denmark or the Netherlands, we can look at Manchester, London and Paris. These are examples of cities that have gone from where we are now to functioning cycle networks in the space of months. We’re talking about months as opposed to years and decades.”Reimagine the cityCampaign chairperson Kevin Baker believes the entire cycle route can be implemented within two years and that, in the meantime, trial sections should be introduced. “The Liffey route will be great for cycling, but there will also be huge bus improvements and improvements for people walking. It will reimagine the city and show a different way for pushing forward towards a more liveable city for the future.”Vice-chairperson of the campaign, Louise Williams, says infrastructure is not only necessary for cyclists already on the roads, but also for the countless people who want to cycle but fear doing so could put their lives at risk.“It’s such an obvious point – the more people who cycle, the better it is for everybody. There’s less congestion, less pollution, we can all get around more easily, we can predict our journeys much better, it’s better for our physical and our mental health... How good it is for our brain health, and our feeling of independence and autonomy, for kids to grow up cycling.”The recent decision by Dropbox to join Dublin Cycling Campaign as a corporate member indicates the growing support for a more cycling-friendly city, said Ms Williams. “Suddenly we’ve got a major player in the industry here in Dublin saying this is an important issue and we want it to be prioritised. We feel the Government may be more likely to listen now that we have Dropbox, and it’s quite likely other organisations will join now.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Cash-for-ash claim cited as evidence SF chief must listen to views of former IRA figuresInterim steps sought due to lengthy delay in building 5km cycle path on river Liffey quaysDespite trenchant criticism of Eoghan Murphy, the electorate likes having a minister in the constituencyStatus yellow warning comes into force at 6pm on Sunday until Monday morningVictim has been treated in hospital for non life-threatening injuriesBodies of Conor (9), Darragh (7) and Carla McGinley (3) found in a house in Newcastle\u0026lsquoBrexit is really only at half-time, we have a huge amount of work still to do\u0026rsquoNobel Peace Prize winner Betty Williams pays tribute in Belfast, with second book to open in DerryFirefighters rescued two adults and a child after alarm was raised on Saturday eveningWoman in her 30s arrested following incident at house in Gorey in early hoursPrimate of All Ireland Eamon Martin to celebrate service at church in MullaghbrackDefence Forces chief relates how Edward Bransfield press-ganged into navy in 1803Lord Mayor says to those involved in drugs: \u0026lsquoThere is no place for you to live among us\u0026rsquoPublic policy, gender roles in work and care and sharing of responsibilities to be debatedMurder inquiry expected after bodies of Conor, Darragh, Carla McGinley found in NewcastleMan arrested as youth taken to Drogheda hospital where condition described as \u0026lsquostable\u0026rsquoHundreds of schools set to close on February 4th as TUI members set to strike on issueParty plans to double bank levy and seeks to reduce unemployment to 4 per cent or lessDeaths in Newcastle: \u0026lsquoThey were just normal kids . . . out there playing and they were happy\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4151854.1580036952!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"seamus mallon tributes sharon stone among those to sign book of condolence","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAmerican actress Sharon Stone (centre) with Nobel Peace Prize winner Betty Williams and the lord mayor of Belfast Daniel Baker signing a book of condolence in Belfast. Photograph: PresseyePA WireA book of condolence has opened in Belfast after the death of former deputy first minister of Northern Ireland Seamus Mallon. Mr Mallon’s death at the age of 83 on Friday has led to an outpouring of gratitude as thousands of people paid tribute to the former SDLP deputy leader.A book of condolence opened in Belfast City Hall on Saturday, and another is due to open at the Guildhall in Derry later on Sunday morning.American actor Sharon Stone was among those to sign the book in Belfast, alongside her friend, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Betty Williams. Ms Stone called Mr Mallon “a legend, a real warrior of peace” as she signed the book along with hundreds of others, including his party colleagues in the SDLP.The actor’s message in the book reads: “With respect and admiration.”The ex-deputy leader of the nationalist SDLP was an architect of the Northern Ireland peace process and a key figure in negotiating the 1998 Belfast Agreement, which largely halted violence.Former US senator George Mitchell, who was heavily involved in creating the Belfast Agreement, also paid tribute to Mr Mallon, who was deputy to Lord Trimble at Stormont from 1998 to 2001.“It’s a great loss for me personally as it is for the people of Northern Ireland,” Mr Mitchell told Q Radio.“Seamus Mallon was a strong and effective political leader for many decades including the period during which the negotiations were held among all of the parties in Northern Ireland that led to the agreement that brought an end to the violence of the Troubles.”Former US president Bill Clinton, who was in office at the time of the Belfast Agreement and championed peace talks in the 1990s, also paid a touching tribute to former Newry and Armagh MP Mr Mallon.He said: “From his earliest entry into politics, Seamus never wavered from his vision for a shared future where neighbours of all faiths could live in dignity, or from the belief he shared with John Hume and the entire SDLP that non-violence was the only way to reach that goal.“As his party’s chief negotiator in the talks leading to the Good Friday Agreement, he was respected by all parties for his intelligence and integrity, his candour and convictions.”Mr Mallon was a former teacher who lived in Markethill, Co Armagh, a largely Protestant town. He is survived by his daughter, Orla.–PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4144248.1579352441!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 dublin bay south constituency profile","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDespite ferocious criticism, to consider the Minster for Housing Eoghan Murphy to be in trouble is to misunderstand what a Fine Gael heartland Dublin Bay South is, according to expert observers. Photograph: Damien Eagers Dublin Bay South is true blue territory and a real Fine Gael heartland, home constituency of embattled Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy and straight-talking TD Kate O’Connell.But the surge to the Greens makes party leader Eamon Ryan likely to top the poll and he will retain his seat.The party’s stunning local elections success has analysts predicting two seats if there are two candidates.The party leader ruled it out as “too presumptuous” and expressed a perennial TD fear that he was “not as safe as houses”.The overall story is five candidates for four seats – the four outgoing TDs and popular Labour Senator Kevin Humphreys, who lost his Dáil seat in 2016.Sighs of relief were heard across the constituency when Independent Senator Michael McDowell ended rife speculation and decided not to run.The former tánaiste would have disrupted both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil but the seat of well-regarded Fianna Fáil TD Jim O’Callaghan should be secure.The Green surge has swallowed much of the left-wing vote as well as some “soft” Fine Gael support.State pension age increaseHealth and housing feature on the campaign trail here but voters are also irritated by the State pension age increase to 67.Labour’s chances depend on the level of swing away from Fine Gael and on how big the Green first-count vote is.If Ryan gets a full quota and is elected on the first count, there is little in the way of transfers for Humphreys, but a two-thirds quota for the Greens and one-third for Labour significantly boosts Labour’s prospects.Despite ferocious criticism, to consider the Minster for Housing to be in trouble is to misunderstand what a Fine Gael heartland this is, according to expert observers. Others insist, however, that “he is in trouble”.Murphy is seen, despite the trenchant criticism, as implementing party housing policy and the electorate likes having a minister in the constituency.There is more concern for outspoken O’Connell, a leading light in the abortion referendum campaign. Effective vote management secured her seat in a head-to-head battle with Lucinda Creighton in 2016.There is no love lost between Murphy and O’Connell but some insist that for Fine Gael to be in government they have to hold the two seats and vote management may come into play again.This is not a Sinn Féin constituency despite a solid performance last time around from Chris Andrews.

Photograph: Dale de la ReyAFPGetty ImagesThe ability of the new coronavirus to spread is strengthening and infections could continue to rise, China’s National Health Commission said on Sunday, with nearly 2,000 people in China infected and 56 killed by the disease.Health authorities around the world are racing to prevent a pandemic after a handful of cases of infection were reported outside China, including in Thailand, Australia, the United States and France.The newly-identified coronavirus has created alarm because much about it is still unknown, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.China’s National Health Commission minister Ma Xiaowei said the incubation period for the virus can range from one to 14 days, during which infection can occur, which was not the case with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars).Sars was a coronavirus that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003.“According to recent clinical information, the virus’ ability to spread seems to be getting somewhat stronger,” Mr Ma told reporters.The Lunar New Year holiday, traditionally celebrated by hundreds of millions of Chinese travelling around the country and abroad to see family, began on Friday but has been severely disrupted by the outbreak.Mr Ma said China would intensify its containment efforts, which have so far included transportation and travel curbs and the cancellation of big events.The country may extend the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, state broadcaster CCTV reported, citing a meeting hosted by Chinese premier Li Keqiang.The virus, believed to have originated late last year in a seafood market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife, has spread to cities including Beijing and Shanghai. Hong Kong has six confirmed cases.The World Health Organisation (WHO) this week stopped short of calling the outbreak a global health emergency, but some health experts question whether China can contain the epidemic.Chinese president Xi Jinping described the situation as “grave” on Saturday.On Sunday, China confirmed 1,975 cases of patients infected as of midnight (4pm Irish time) on January 25th, while the death toll from the virus has risen to 56, CCTV reported.Health officials in Orange County, California, reported that a third case of the virus had been registered in the United States in a traveller from Wuhan, who was in isolation and in good condition.On Saturday, Canada declared a first “presumptive” confirmed case in a resident who had returned from Wuhan. Australia confirmed its first four cases.No fatalities have been reported outside China.On Sunday, China temporarily banned nationwide the sale of wildlife in markets, restaurants, and e-commerce platforms. Wild and often poached animals packed together in Chinese markets are blamed as incubators for viruses to evolve and jump the species barrier to humans.BanSnakes, peacocks, crocodiles and other species can also be found for sale via Taobao, an e-commerce website run by Alibaba.The New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society called on China to make the ban permanent.The US state department said it will relocate personnel at its Wuhan consulate to the United States, while Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe said the government was working with China to arrange a charter flight for Japanese nationals to return from Wuhan.The outbreak has prompted widening curbs on movements within China, with Wuhan, a city of 11 million, on virtual lockdown and transport links all-but severed except for emergency vehicles.Health authorities in Beijing urged people not to shake hands but instead salute using a traditional cupped-hand gesture. The advice was sent in a text message that went out to mobile phone users in the city on Sunday morning.Beijing also postponed the reopening of the city’s schools and universities after the Lunar New Year holiday, state radio reported. Hong Kong had already delayed the reopening of schools to February 17th.China has called for transparency in managing the crisis, after a cover-up of the spread of the Sars virus eroded public trust, but officials in Wuhan have been criticised for their handling of the current outbreak.“People in my hometown all suspect the real infected patients number given by authorities,” said Violet Li, who lives in the Wuhan district where the seafood market is located.“I go out with a mask twice a day to walk the dog - that’s the only outdoor activity,” she told Reuters by text message.Illustrating the extend of disruption to life in China, overall passenger travel declined by nearly 29 per cent on Saturday, the first day of the Lunar New Year, from a year earlier, with air passengers down nearly 42 per cent, a transportation ministry official said.Many cinemas across China were closed with major film premieres postponed.Cruise operators including Royal Caribbean Cruises, and Costa Cruises said they had cancelled a combined 12 cruises that had been scheduled to embark from Chinese ports before February 2nd.Hong Kong Disneyland and the city’s Ocean Park were closed on Sunday. Shanghai Disneyland, which expected 100,000 visitors daily through the holiday period, has already closed.Airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, although some health officials and experts have questioned the effectiveness of these efforts.–Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Europe \u0026#39has a duty\u0026#39 to stand up to Russia over re-writing of holocaust historyTurkey\u0026#39s Recep Tayyip Erdogan hits back at criticism of earthquake readiness as death toll reaches 35Carey Mulligan wants overhaul of Oscars voting system Len McCluskey says \u0026#39good riddance\u0026#39 to MPs threatening to quit if Rebecca Long-Bailey is elected Labour leaderCoronavirus outbreak: British citizens advised to leave Hubei Province Coronavirus is becoming more contagious and can infect during incubation, Chinese authorities warnMonty Python frontman Terry Jones donated his brain to dementia research Coronavirus infection: everything you need to know about the outbreak from China Dramatic bodycam video shows police shootout in Seattle Comment: We voted for a tax-cutting Tory party, not for raising the burden by stealthFrance is losing the battle to save the baguette, warns leading bread historian Comment: Pessimistic Remainers never stood a chance against the inherent optimism of BrexitBoeing 777X, the world’s largest twin-engine jet, completes first flightComment: Dread threats from the EU will not stop us from returning power to the British peopleAfrica threatened with severe food crisis as locust \u0026#39mega-swarms\u0026#39 devour crops Time for church to own up to past and present racism, say clergyComment: Why exactly should we cheer Sinn Fein’s return to office in Northern Ireland?Gardens will look completely different in 20 years time as pests are out of control, Gardeners\u0026#39 World presenter warns Coronavirus: Baby born to \u0026#39infected\u0026#39 mother as backlash grows against local Wuhan officialsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/20/TELEMMGLPICT000015129079_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"bbc panicking publics rejection arrogant left liberal worldview","story":"The crisis of confidence at the BBC is probably the most visible sign of the shift in public opinionThis is nearly over – this weird disconnect between what most of us understand as reality and the world as seen through the eyes of an all pervasive Authority that was apparently appointed (although we never knew by whom) to establish the limits of public discourse. The crisis of confidence at the BBC – and make no mistake, it is a full blown, all alarm bells ringing, catastrophic crisis – is probably the most visible sign of the shift but it is much bigger than this.So bear with me: I promise that the whole column is not going to be about the BBC, even though it is easily the most infuriating and useful exemplar of the problem.But no, what could be about to implode is not just the sublime, unlimited self-regard of the broadcasters. It is nothing less than the whole interlocking set of preconceptions that are so embedded in the consciousness of those who decide what it is acceptable to think that they must ignore or traduce anything that contradicts them.Of course, self-doubt should have begun with the Brexit referendum result but that scarcely slowed them down: if a majority of the country were benighted bigots then it was up to the enlightened ones to lead them out of the darkness. Or to bully them out of it. And believe it or not, a good many of the Enlightened actually believed they had succeeded in this – hence the demand for a second referendum which would allow the masses to repent of their ignorance.Future of the BBC | The best comment and analysisThen came the general election which was, in effect, a second referendum. And that was the end. You could hear the sound of an edifice falling to the ground and smashing into pieces as you watched the television coverage of this cataclysm. It was such a resounding and utterly unexpected repudiation not just of the mindset of the BBC but of virtually all of the broadcast media – and the cultural circles in which their denizens travel – that it will probably be a generation before they recover. If they ever recover.Indeed, we must hope that the vainglorious arrogance never does return. What we want is not another set of sacred tenets which can be enforced with monolithic certainty, but humility: a genuinely liberal regard for differing opinions. But you know all this. Everybody knows it – except apparently the broadcast executives who are now running around in crazy circles like ants whose nest has been demolished.Presumably this sense of mission to enforce a moral doctrine and prescribe its rules to a grateful nation emerged from the post-war period when rationing and rebuilding dominated the country’s priorities. The most charitable interpretation of this phenomenon is that it began as a belief that it was the duty owed by the educated classes to British working people who had endured terrible deprivations and danger.If you listen to the patronising tone of the many public information pronouncements of the time, this is what you hear: we are going to create a new future with better housing, a fairer distribution of resources, state-run services and comprehensive health and welfare provision. You must trust our judgment in all things: we know better than you what is needed. Which is pretty much exactly the tone that the political descendants of those public policy managers adopt today, only now they are talking about climate change, multiculturalism, economic globalisation and gender identity.Arguably, a good many of the solutions that the Enlightened Benefactors imposed on society even in that earlier incarnation were wrong-headed or dangerously skewed by the political fashions of the time. Were vast council estates really a social improvement on the old Victorian terraces which might have been renovated rather than demolished? Were rationing and the nationalising of public services actually ways of ensuring fairness, or just a handicap to economic recovery?Lord Hall\u0026#039s message to all BBC staffBut at least back then it was plausible to claim that most people in the country bought into those beliefs. The trauma of the war had created a genuine sense of national unanimity. There had probably never been such widespread agreement on priorities and so much willingness to make sacrifices for the general good. If the specific programmes were questionable, they would be challenged only by a small and rather unpopular minority of sceptics.Needless to say, that is not the case with the doctrines being enforced by the great unidentifiable Authority now. Even if you accept that climate change is a fact, you might want to see less shrill alarmism and more attention paid to possible solutions that do not involve pauperising the developing world. (The BBC recently put Sir David Attenborough’s announcement of imminent climate crisis at the top of its main news bulletins. With great respect to the saintly Sir David, something that he says is not the most important news story of any day.)You may welcome migrants of all colours and backgrounds, and have limitless compassion for the disabled, without wishing to see classic literary texts re-written and programme presentation rotas designed to ensure their visibility. You may sympathise with the problems of sexual minorities but be disturbed by the proportion of attention that is devoted to their demands. In other words, you may be angry and frustrated by the implicit assumption that you and your reservations are beyond the pale.I am sure it is not an accident that adversaries of the official enlightened wisdom are only invited to participate in broadcast debate under the most loaded and disadvantaged circumstances, to be set against a solid phalanx of the upholders of Virtue – which is why so many of us have given up trying. It is really rather difficult to argue with people who think you don’t have a right to exist (quite literally, in the case of Israel).But the truth has finally hit.

If you are in this area and able to leave, you should do so. This is due to the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak.Previous advice by the FCO said that all but essential travel to Wuhan should be avoided, followed by a warning hours later to avoid all travel to Wuhan City.Any attempts to evacuate British citizens are likely to be hampered by the Chinese authorities\u0027 restrictions on movements in and out of Wuhan. There are no plans for the UK to pull its diplomats out of the region, despite the growing death toll and a decision by the US to fly home consular staff and their families.Deadly coronavirus reaches Europe: in picturesAs many as 500 French citizens in the city, meanwhile, will be offered a coach service by the consulate general of France in Wuhan to take them to safety.The Foreign Office and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is now facing a growing backlash over its response to the crisis, with several British professionals based in Wuhan claiming they had been offered no help.Simon Gibbons, a 36-year-old from London who works in the automotive industry in Wuhan, told the : “We haven’t had any official notice from the British government - the French and American Embassies seem to be doing everything they can in light of the situation to provide their citizens with every opportunity to leave the city.“Yet again we see that the approach favoured by the FCO is sitting back and watching the situation develop before they put any plans in place - when 300 brits in Wuhan are scared to leave the house.”Joe Armitt, a 30-year-old English teacher originally from Northampton, added: “It seems like the French and the American embassies are going to great lengths to ensure their citizens have a safe repatriation plan.“For the Brits, we’ve seen no real attempt form the British Embassy or Foreign Office to reach out and offer us support.”Thirty-one people have been tested for the virus in the UK, including 17 in the space of 24 hours, but no cases have yet been identified. On Saturday night the death toll in China was reported to be 56, with 13 new fatalities and hundreds of new confirmed cases.This puts the nationwide total of confirmed infections at 1,975. Canada confirmed its first case on Saturday.Passengers arrive at Heathrow Airport from Gengzhou, ChinaFears are mounting that coronavirus could spread before symptoms begin to show in patients, as British researchers said a vaccine breakthrough could be just weeks away. Travellers who have returned to the UK from Wuhan, China, have been advised to remain inside if they feel unwell after Xi Jinping, the Chinese President, warned the spread of the deadly illness was “accelerating”. There have yet to be any confirmed cases in the UK, which is one of the first countries to have a specific test for the disease outside China, but its arrival is feared to be inevitable. British authorities hope to head off a potential public health crisis by asking those who are concerned they may be infected to book a phone consultation with their GP, rather than visit the surgery.However, research has now suggested the infection can be passed between people without them realising, after genetic analysis was conducted on the newly discovered illness.Scientists concluded it “appears possible” the virus can be spread before the carrier notices any symptoms, meaning an outbreak in the UK may prove challenging to contain. It came after six family members who arrived at a hospital in Hong Kong with unexplained pneumonia - which coronavirus can bring about - had their medical tests analysed in research published by The Lancet. A separate study found that sustained human-to-human spread was the only plausible explanation for the scale of the outbreak. Previously, Chinese authorities and the World Health Organization insisted that the majority of cases had jumped into humans from animals. But the first modelling study to examine disease transmission found that each infected person passed it on to an average of 2.6 others. This raises the possibility that an outbreak will only be controlled if onward transmission is blocked in well over 60 per cent of cases.We need to plan for the possibility containment of this epidemic isn’t possible, said Neil Ferguson, a disease outbreak scientist at Imperial College London who led the research.Professor Robin Shattock, from Imperial College London, said his team had “two vaccine candidates” developed from the genetic sequence of coronavirus provided by Chinese scientists. He told Radio 4’s Today programme the vaccines would be ready for use in “animal models” by the middle of next month and they were ready to “rapidly move those into human studies” if required. Meanwhile, efforts are continuing to track down around 2,000 people who have flown back to the UK from Wuhan - with airlines and the Border Force now helping the Government to contact passengers. It is unclear how many have been located since returning from the region in the past two weeks.An update from the Government, published on Saturday, warned coronavirus is believed to be particularly dangerous for older people or those with weakened immune systems or long-term illnesses.It added: “If you have visited Wuhan and develop a fever, difficulty breathing or a cough within 14 days, you should seek medical attention either in China or on your return to the UK. “In the UK, please stay indoors and avoid contact with others where possible, call your GP or ring 111 informing them of your symptoms and your recent travel to the city.”Pandemics and epidemicsEurope \u0026#39has a duty\u0026#39 to stand up to Russia over re-writing of holocaust historyTurkey\u0026#39s Recep Tayyip Erdogan hits back at criticism of earthquake readiness as death toll reaches 35Carey Mulligan wants overhaul of Oscars voting system Len McCluskey says \u0026#39good riddance\u0026#39 to MPs threatening to quit if Rebecca Long-Bailey is elected Labour leaderCoronavirus is becoming more contagious and can infect during incubation, Chinese authorities warnMonty Python frontman Terry Jones donated his brain to dementia research Coronavirus infection: everything you need to know about the outbreak from China Dramatic bodycam video shows police shootout in Seattle Comment: We voted for a tax-cutting Tory party, not for raising the burden by stealthFrance is losing the battle to save the baguette, warns leading bread historian Comment: Pessimistic Remainers never stood a chance against the inherent optimism of BrexitBoeing 777X, the world’s largest twin-engine jet, completes first flightComment: Dread threats from the EU will not stop us from returning power to the British peopleAfrica threatened with severe food crisis as locust \u0026#39mega-swarms\u0026#39 devour crops Time for church to own up to past and present racism, say clergyGardens will look completely different in 20 years time as pests are out of control, Gardeners\u0026#39 World presenter warns Comment: Why exactly should we cheer Sinn Fein’s return to office in Northern Ireland?Coronavirus: Baby born to \u0026#39infected\u0026#39 mother as backlash grows against local Wuhan officialsUS evacuates consular staff from Wuhan as coronavirus outbreak \u0026#39accelerates\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/17/16/radiator.jpg","title":"home sustainable green smart thermostat heat price energy","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.So begins my year of living greenly. My mission to make our house more sustainable starts with thinking about making it warmer this week, I’ve been mostly thinking about thermostats.Given my day job is technology editor here at The Independent, it’s the technological solutions that seem most immediate. And starting with the thermostat seems an obvious one, given how much money and emissions are wasted on central heating.We recently got a smart thermostat, after struggling with a decidedly un-smart timer on our boiler. There was of course nothing green about that, given that it spent much of the time coming on when we weren’t even in. And there was plenty that wasn’t comfortable about it, either, since it would often be on when the house was too hot, or not in as we shivered in the cold. (In the end we gave up and mostly turned it off and on manually.)Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe have the Nest Thermostat E. (Nest, which is now owned by Google, are probably the most famous of the smart home companies, and the thermostat is probably their most famous product the E supposedly stands for a variety of things including “easy” and “energy-saving”, but basically means that it’s the cheaper version.) It works by getting your location and learning how you tend to like your heating, setting up a smart schedule and turning the heating off when you’re not there.So since the beginning of the year I’ve been thinking about how best we can optimise the amount of energy that thermostat uses. Though it is smart, it still works on what you tell it as such, you can change what sort of temperature you want it to be.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

So the main thing I’ve done is turn the heating down before we get into bed, ensuring that we aren’t wasting heat that will only be around once we’ve gone to bed. (Another of my personal pledges for 2020 is to ensure that I pay full attention to my sleep, after reading Matthew Walker’s luminous book on the subject, and this helps with that too.)Why I\u0027m making my home more eco-friendlyThe Nest gives you a leaf when you’re being energy-\u0026nbspand eco-conscious by having the temperature lower than it might expect. And I feel generally rewarded, too: while there’s no real way to know the impact this is having on our own gas usage, it feels like we almost certainly are saving energy.Smart thermostats – or, if you are like me and didn’t have a non-smart one before, any kind of thermostat – feel like a wonderful symbol of how easy it can be to be more efficient. As it turns out, we aren’t much colder our house is still heated when we need it. It’s just that it won’t be heated when we’re not there, or when we’re already warm enough. Saving money and emissions on heating has actually made life easier.Getting one is expensive, of course: the Nest Thermostat E is £199, and you’ll have to pay for installation if you live in a confusing, complicated house like ours. But most people probably won’t need to, and there are plenty of deals and discount schemes from energy companies that should make it a little more easy to swallow.I suspect, as we head through the year of making our house more sustainable, that not all the changes we make will be quite so seamless, comfortable or sacrifice free. But I certainly hope so, because this feels like the kind of change that is incredibly nice to make, not only helping save the world in the tiniest way, but also saving money, and saving us from being cold.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That means no popping into M\u0026ampS for pants. No rummaging through Primark for\u0026nbspsocks. And certainly no scrambling through Topshop for a last-minute party dress​, writes Olivia PetterI despair when I watch Love Island. It’s not just because the contestants look the same each year, or because their conversations are dull as dishwater. It’s about what they wear.\u0026nbspEvery year, the same cohort of aspiring Instagram influencers bounds into that sun-soaked villa claiming to be “looking for love” when in fact, the only thing they’re looking for is a contract with Boohoo. Or Missguided. Or Nasty Gal. Or any other fast fashion brand that will pay them oodles of money to wear their clothes and sit in on a design meeting or two.\u0026nbspSince the ITV2 programme started in its current iteration, its contestants have gone on to land six-figure deals with fast fashion labels. Last season alone, female stars including Molly-Mae Hague, Maura Higgins and Amber Gill all landed up lucrative partnerships with Pretty Little Thing, Boohoo and MissPap, respectively – Gill’s is rumoured to be worth £1m. The men fared well\u0026nbsptoo\u0026nbsp– Ovie Soko got a deal with ASOS while Tommy Fury was snapped up by Boohoo Man. They follow in the footsteps of former contestants like Kem Cetinay, Amber Davies and Olivia Buckland, who have also gone on to partner with fast fashion brands since leaving the show.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesCreated with Sketch.Winter Love Island 2020: Meet the 12 contestants Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Shaugna is a democratic services officer from London.

His celebrity crush is Lily James.Meanwhile, the show has been sponsored by fast fashion brands (Missguided and then I Saw it First) for the last three years, giving viewers the opportunity to shop the female Islanders’ looks directly. Personally, I’ve always thought that Love Island contestants dress terribly: it’s Benidorm beaches meets Kardashian kitsch. But with prices starting at £5, the clothes are devastatingly cheap. Far cheaper than the designer garb we see on most TV stars. So I can understand the appeal. But I also know that every time someone buys one of those bikinis, or sparkly bodycon dresses, they’re adding fuel to fast fashion’s ever-blazing fire.But perhaps the onus is not on the consumer, or even the Love Island star. Lauren Bravo, author of How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, explains that the brands are the ones who should really be shouldering responsibility here. “These days we’re so used to instant gratification, and the idea that anyone can aspire to celebrity, that it seems reasonable for TV stars to sell us clothes and vice versa,” she tells me. “And it’s really hard, because I know what it’s like to love fashion and crave the clothes you’re seeing on people you admire, not to mention the huge social pressures on young people to keep that endless parade of new looks rolling over on their Instagram grid, so telling people who can’t necessarily afford to spend any more that their shopping habits are destroying the planet can feel snobbish and unfair.”Why I\u0027m giving up fast fashion #20PledgesBut, Bravo adds, the fact remains that those clothes simply cannot be made as cheaply as they’re sold. Somewhere down the line, someone is paying the price, whether it’s a garment worker barely surviving on poverty wages or a community grappling with industrial pollution.That’s not to say you can’t “get the Islander look” in a sustainable and eco-friendly way. Bravo suggests heading to secondhand shopping apps, like Depop, where you’ll find plenty of pre-loved items not dissimilar from the ones you see on the show. Some of them will be from fast fashion brands, but if you’re buying it there, you’re keeping that item in circulation as opposed to letting it wind up in landfill.\u0026nbspOr, you could take a closer look at some of the trends championed by Love Islanders, both past and present, and see that many (cycling shorts, mesh, high-waisted jeans and leopard print) hark back to another era, like, say, the 1990s. And what better way to shop Nineties fashion than by heading to your local Beyond Retro or Rokit, which will be jam-packed with original clothing from the decade that is not only more sustainable, but a hell of a lot cooler, too.How to Break Up with Fast Fashion by Lauren Bravo (£12.99, Headline Home) is out nowOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Savers in countries such as Germany have grown angry at near-zero savings rates.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe said that for the first 10 years of the ECB’s life its goal was to fight high levels of inflation. “The financial crisis was the pivotal point at which eventually inflation was too low, so it’s been a reversal of the situation. It requires that we look at the strategy very carefully and how effective we can be.”The process is expected to conclude by the end of 2020 and Lagarde declined to say if any decisions had been taken. “I would not include, exclude or anticipate how we are going to deliver it,” she said.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

But she added the bank would always be governed by its mandate to achieve price stability.The idea that the ECB will adjust its policy to help fight climate change has been at the top of the agenda since Lagarde was appointed president late last year.\u0026nbspShe acknowledged that the debate over the ECB’s role would be controversial and spark criticism. “Is there going to be mandate creep? Isn’t that going to be a distraction? Why should it be the role of central banks?” she gave as examples.She insisted the greater danger was to do nothing. “Failing to try is already failing,” she said, adding that the ECB should consider every area where it could participate in an agenda shared by the European Commission and many eurozone leaders.She insisted that the review would be open to alternative views from within the ECB’s governing council. “I’m not a despotic president of the governing council — all views are welcome,” she said.Earlier the bank said that decided to keep its interest rates on hold, as had been expected. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00 per cent, 0.25 per cent and -0.50 per cent respectively.Lagarde said that rates would stay at their historic inflation level until the bank saw inflation get a level “sufficiently” close to its 2 per cent target.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is patently absurd to compare Takeaway with Amazon when evaluating the outlook for future competition.”The decision to open up a probe came after the CMA said it had “reconsidered its position” more than six months after Takeaway first bid for Just Eat.The competition watchdog said: “Information we now have available to us suggests that Takeaway could have been well-placed to enter the UK market, if the merger hadn’t happened, and compete with Just Eat – so it’s important we open a formal investigation to find out more about this.“Ultimately, our job is to protect UK consumers. Merging businesses can always choose to formally notify a merger to the CMA if they want to avoid the risk that the deal could be called in for investigation at a later stage – and Takeaway chose not to do this.”The CMA said that it could not be specific about the new information it had received. Cat Rock urged the regulator to complete its work quickly so that the deal could be completed.Earlier this month Just Eat shareholders agreed to a £5.9bn all-share offer from Takeaway after a drawn-out battle with rival bidder Prosus.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Its reading of 52.9, up from 50.0 in December, was also at a 16-month high, while the rebound in manufacturing to an eight-month high of 49.5 was not enough to tip over the line into expansion.Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg\u0026nbspBank, said that the jump in the PMI for January provides yet more evidence that UK economic activity has started to turn up sharply since the election.“Brexit progress, the promise of a big fiscal stimulus in spring, and the end of the risk that far-left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn could one day become prime minister have lifted confidence and lowered uncertainty,” he said.Market traders pared back their prediction of the likelihood of a rate cut from 70 per cent on Friday to less than 50 per cent after the release of the\u0026nbspPMI data.Simon Wells, chief European economist\u0026nbspat HSBC, said that, on balance, he believed the PMI survey would keep the Bank of England on hold at the last meeting of its monetary policy committee to be chaired by outgoing governor Mark Carney.However, he added: “Before the market races to price out any chance of rate cuts this year, it is worth keeping in mind that GDP and retail sales data were very weak, and inflation has been soft.“The PMI is still consistent with a 0.2 per cent quarterly GDP growth rate, in line with the BoE\u0027s November forecast, and still fairly sluggish. We therefore still think a rate cut could happen in May, although January now looks less likely.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This was the lowest since the aftermath of the global financial crisis in the final quarter of 2009 when it hit 9.5 per cent.The fall was driven by a sharp fall in profits in the North Sea oil and gas, that slimmed to 1.3 per cent from 2.3 per cent as the prices of both fuels fell in the third quarter.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, the drop in profits was witnessed across business with services firms suffering a 0.4 points fall to 15.2 per cent and manufacturers down by a steeper 0.9 points to 11.1 per cent.Earlier this week figures showed the number of firms issuing profits warnings hit a four-year high in the final quarter of last year, according to business advisers EY.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gabriella Zaghari-Ratcliffe stands next to her father Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and his mother Barbara, as they address the media in Downing Street following a meeting with Prime Minister Boris JohnsonRosa Connolly takes a close look during a preview of the Tyrannosaurs exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland, EdinburghThe sun sets behind tower cranes and the London skyline in the city financial districtPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, speaks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson as they attend the UK-Africa Investment Summit at the Intercontinental Hotel in London.

The share of companies warning in 2019 hit 17.8 per cent, just surpassing 2008’s figure at the peak of the financial crisis. A third of FTSE-listed retailers issued warnings in 2019.The figures came as the retail industry said shops shed 57,000 jobs in 2019 as employment in the once-vibrant high street and shopping centre contracted for the fourth successive year.The British Retail Consortium said the total number of retail employees fell by 1.8 per cent in the final three months of 2019 compared with a year earlier. Full time employment fell by 3.0 per cent and part-time by 1.2 per cent.This was the 16th consecutive quarterly fall, which the BRC said was “proof” that the transformation of the retail industry was ongoing.Helen Dickinson, the BRC’s chief executive said it was essential the government used its review of the business rates system for a reform of a tax that fall disproportionately heavily on retailers.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But eagle-eyed royal fans spotted a mistake in the trailer for the third season. When Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth II is shown celebrating her 1977 Silver Jubilee, the voiceover gets the date of the Queen’s coronation wrong by a year, saying the Silver jubilee was 25 years after the Coronation. It was actually 24 years, as her coronation took place on June 2, 1953.  The ITV fish-out-of-water detective drama stars Rob Lowe as a US police chief who moves to the UK to take up the role of Chief Constable with East Lincolnshire police. He wears four medal ribbons – Diamond Jubilee Medal, Golden Jubilee Medal, Queen\u0027s Police Medal and Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. The trouble is not only are they in the wrong order, but he shouldn’t be wearing any of them. He’s an American who hasn’t previously served in the British police.Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) states that his sister Samantha was abducted by aliens but his recollections of it are contradictory. During hypnotherapy regression therapy, he says he was unable to move at the time, but during flashbacks, he is perfectly able to do so. Mulder is also seen wearing a wedding ring in the season five episode “Travellers. Why had he never mentioned being married? In reality, Duchovny had recently got married. But it added a big change to Mulder’s past.How old is the Doctor? In the classic-era he states he’s anywhere between 500 to several thousand years old. But in the revived series, David Tennant’s Doctor claims he is 904 years old. Unless he’s lying, somewhere along the line, the continuity has slipped up.During Ralphie’s death scene in his kitchen, Tony Soprano is almost blinded by a can of spray, but knocks Ralphie to the floor and kills him. The scene was meant to end with Tony putting his hands on the counter and gasping for air but James Gandolfini, who brilliantly plays Tony, accidentally put his hand down on the oven’s lit burners. The cry of pain was real – but this mistake worked perfectly for the scene.622 Game of Thrones The greatest oops moment in GoT’s was in the final season when a stray Starbucks cup is sitting on a wooden table next to Emilia Clarke’s character Daenerys Targaryen. Did nobody spot it? There were also plastic water bottles near Samwell Tarly’s and Ser Davos’s feet in the final episode.When Marge tells Homer she is pregnant with Maggie in the episode “And Maggie Makes Three”, which first aired in 1995, a picture of Maggie can be seen hanging on the wall of the living room – a right clanger – considering this is before she is even born.The second season of the TV drama is set in October 1984 – a year after the first season. Considering the show trades in nostalgia, you would have thought they\u0027d get the soundtrack right – but they didn’t. Mistakes include The Smith\u0027s song There is a Light That Never Goes Out playing in the background during a flashback between Will and Jonathan. Trouble is, this particular Smiths song wasn\u0027t released until 1986. There was also a motoring error: Barb\u0027s Volkswagon Cabrio was actually made in 1988. In the first season’s episode Provenance, it seems that the actors got a bit lazy, referring to characters by their real names, not their character’s name. Dean appears to call his brother “Jared”, when the character’s name is Sam Winchester and an extra calls the character Dean Winchester “Jensen”, which is again the name of the actor who plays him. It’s one of those shows in which fans searched for hidden clues and meanings. But they picked up on more than intended. In the plane crash scene in the first episode, right before the turbine explodes, a mysterious dark object sweeps upwards only visible to fans sifting through the scene frame by frame. Was it an early manifestation of the smoke monster? No, according to producers, it was just a CGI error.More name mix-ups occur early on in the long-running US sitcom. The aspiring actress Penny, played by Kaley Cuoco, refers to her dad as “Bob”, but once he’s introduced on the show, he is called “Wyatt”. Also there is a plot mistake regarding the broken elevator in the apartment building. When they lug the time machine up the stairs in season one, Leonard explains to Howard that the elevator has been broken for two years. But Howard should know this considering he was there when Leonard blew it up. This is revealed during a flash back in a later episode, where it also states that the event took place five years ago, not two.The BBC hit drama had a continuity error when its star Suranne Jones is seen drinking a glass of wine in her kitchen. As she gulps the wine and texts from her phone, the fridge door in the background is open, then closed, then open – all by itself.1322 Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season one establishes that vampires have no breath – it\u0027s confirmed when Angel is unable to perform CPR. But the vampires talk, pant and even smoke – all which require breathing – while Spike is even tortured by drowning.During a scene in season nine, episode 15 (“The One with the Mugging”), Jennifer Aniston was replaced with a stand-in while her character Rachel was still in shot. She sits at the table at the edge of the frame and is even wearing a different top. In another scene, Phoebe, is chatting to her friend  Monica, but it’s not Monica. It’s Courteney Cox’s body double who has been left carelessly in the shot.Fans laughed out loud when Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) finds Seb Franklin (Harry Visinoni) injured on the pavement and picks up her mobile to call emergency services. She managed to do it without touching the screen, unlocking her phone or dialling any numbers.1622 Malcolm in the MiddleIn the US sitcom about a dysfunctional family, when Lois walks out holding her ruined dress that is soaking wet to confront her kids, there is a crew member crouching in the hallway holding a bucket.The heartthrob paediatrician Doug Ross, played by George Clooney, had a son prior to his romance with Carol – or did he? Although he mentions the son a few times in season one, he claims later in the series not to have any children.In the first episode of this sci-fi series, the steering wheel has disappeared from the set of the spaceship. Serenity’s pilot Wash, played by Alan Tudyk, can be seen improvising with his hands around an imaginary wheel. It’s hard to believe this mistake wasn’t caught.The mistake actually ended up changing the plot of the series. Supposedly, David Lynch accidentally caught the crew member Frank Silva on camera when his reflection appeared in a mirror in a scene when Laura Palmer was shown screaming. Lynch liked it so much that he decided to keep it in and cast Silva as the character Killer Bob, a dark spirit who haunts Laura.2022 Two and a Half Men Charlie Sheen is seen talking on an upside down iPhone while sitting in a flash red car with a sexily clad woman next to him.The whopper of a mistake did not happen on screen, but in a promotional shot posted online. It was a surprise to see a plastic water bottle perched on the mantle piece behind the Earl of Grantham and Lady Edith considering the series is set in the 1920s. Other mistakes onscreen include a TV aerial on top of a house and double yellow lines on the road.More name mix-ups occur early on in the long-running US sitcom.

Savers in countries such as Germany have grown angry at near-zero savings rates.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe said that for the first 10 years of the ECB’s life its goal was to fight high levels of inflation. “The financial crisis was the pivotal point at which eventually inflation was too low, so it’s been a reversal of the situation. It requires that we look at the strategy very carefully and how effective we can be.”The process is expected to conclude by the end of 2020 and Lagarde declined to say if any decisions had been taken. “I would not include, exclude or anticipate how we are going to deliver it,” she said.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

But she added the bank would always be governed by its mandate to achieve price stability.The idea that the ECB will adjust its policy to help fight climate change has been at the top of the agenda since Lagarde was appointed president late last year.\u0026nbspShe acknowledged that the debate over the ECB’s role would be controversial and spark criticism. “Is there going to be mandate creep? Isn’t that going to be a distraction? Why should it be the role of central banks?” she gave as examples.She insisted the greater danger was to do nothing. “Failing to try is already failing,” she said, adding that the ECB should consider every area where it could participate in an agenda shared by the European Commission and many eurozone leaders.She insisted that the review would be open to alternative views from within the ECB’s governing council. “I’m not a despotic president of the governing council — all views are welcome,” she said.Earlier the bank said that decided to keep its interest rates on hold, as had been expected. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00 per cent, 0.25 per cent and -0.50 per cent respectively.Lagarde said that rates would stay at their historic inflation level until the bank saw inflation get a level “sufficiently” close to its 2 per cent target.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is patently absurd to compare Takeaway with Amazon when evaluating the outlook for future competition.”The decision to open up a probe came after the CMA said it had “reconsidered its position” more than six months after Takeaway first bid for Just Eat.The competition watchdog said: “Information we now have available to us suggests that Takeaway could have been well-placed to enter the UK market, if the merger hadn’t happened, and compete with Just Eat – so it’s important we open a formal investigation to find out more about this.“Ultimately, our job is to protect UK consumers. Merging businesses can always choose to formally notify a merger to the CMA if they want to avoid the risk that the deal could be called in for investigation at a later stage – and Takeaway chose not to do this.”The CMA said that it could not be specific about the new information it had received. Cat Rock urged the regulator to complete its work quickly so that the deal could be completed.Earlier this month Just Eat shareholders agreed to a £5.9bn all-share offer from Takeaway after a drawn-out battle with rival bidder Prosus.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Searchers may be considered John Ford\u0027s greatest film, but it was not treated as such back in the 1950s. In fact, the western starring John Wayne failed to earn a single nomination. Around the World in 80 Days turned out to be more the Academy\u0027s cup of tea.Not only did Alfred Hitchcock never win an Oscar (save for his memorial award in 1968), but neither did any of his films – one of which is Vertigo, a classic that won Sight \u0026amp Sound\u0027s once-a-decade greatest films of all time poll in 2012. If it had been nominated, it would have faced stiff competition in the form of eventual winner All About Eve.One of the films that kickstarted the New Hollywood Cinema era, The Graduate may have won director Mike Nichols an Oscar, but it ultimately lost out to Norman Jewison\u0027s In the Heat of the Night.  Stanley Kubrick\u0027s sci-fi classic remains one of the most influential pieces of cinema there is. The Academy didn\u0027t agree. The Academy nominated Kubrick for Best Director and awarded the visual effects in favour of considering 2001 for Best Picture (it didn\u0027t even get nominated). That year\u0027s winner was Oliver!, the musical by Carol Reed.Despite Taxi Driver\u0027s failure to win the main award, its nomination in four categories showed the Academy had good intentions. That All the President\u0027s Men and Network also lost out to eventual winner Rocky shows that, ultimately, it never really stood a chance.Francis Ford Coppola\u0027s ambitious Vietnam War epic Apocalypse Now received a grand total of eight nominations, but only went home with two prizes (for cinematography and sound) losing out to drama Kramer vs. Kramer.Of all the Oscar blows dealt to Martin Scorsese over the decades, none landed harder than Raging Bull losing out to Robert Redford\u0027s weepie Ordinary People, an oversight many consider one of the Academy\u0027s most egregious.  Another sci-fi classic overlooked by the Oscars was Blade Runner, which didn\u0027t even get nominated in the Best Picture category (Gandhi ended up winning).

In the ensuing years, the film has been hailed as one of the greatest of the 2010s, meaning that its no-show at the Oscars will go down as one of the Academy\u0027s biggest omissions.

The scientists hope to have a pilot factory producing the batteries within five years at the Berkeley site.The ultimate aim is to have a factory based at one of the former power stations in the South West that takes Carbon-14 isotopes directly from the graphite blocks for use in diamond batteries. This would significantly reduce the radioactivity of the remaining material, making it easier and safer to manage,” said Professor Tom Scott, director of the South West Nuclear Hub.With the majority of the UK’s nuclear power plants set to go offline in the next 10-15 years this presents a huge opportunity to recycle a large amount of material to generate power for so many great uses.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And they hope that it could shed light on where other such superluminous supernovae get their intensity from.The new breakthrough came when researchers discovered that the star gained its intense brightness when a normal supernova crashed into a shell of material that surrounded it.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

They suggested that vast amounts of iron could account for that particular line, as researchers call it – and when they tested that scenario, it worked.Scientists detect ‘unknown’ burst of gravitational waves in spaceIt became even more exciting when it quickly turned out that very large amounts of iron was needed to make the lines - at least a third of the Sun\u0027s mass - which directly ruled out some old scenarios and instead revealed a new one,\u0026nbspsaid Anders Jerkstrand from the Department of Astronomy at Stockholm University.The researchers suggest that before SN 2006gy\u0026nbspbecame what it is today, there was a double star made up of a white dwarf as big as Earth, and a huge hydrogen-rich massive star the size of our solar system. As the bigger star became even bigger, the smaller one was caught up in it and fell in towards the centre.When it got there, the white dwarf exploded into a Type Ia supernova – a normal supernova. That then collided with the envelope surrounding it, creating the giant collision that sent the light streaming across the universe.That a Type Ia supernova appears to be behind SN\u0026nbsp2006gy\u0026nbspturns upside down what most researchers have believed, says Anders\u0026nbspJerkstrand.That a white dwarf can be in close orbit with a massive hydrogen-rich star, and quickly explode upon falling to the centre, gives important new information for the theory of double star evolution and the conditions necessary for a white dwarf to explode.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

HS2 plays an important part in that”.A spokesperson for HS2 Ltd told The Observer: “Phase one of HS2 is the only shovel-ready major transport project in the UK. It has taken 10 years of expert design and development, parliamentary scrutiny and public consultation to get to this point. No other major projects are within at least five years of being where HS2 is today, and upgrades to the existing network cannot deliver the same benefits.“The UK construction sector, the companies working on the project, and those relocating to cities along the route, and the civic leaders in the Midlands and north eager to benefit from the investment\u0026nbspHS2 will bring to their regions are all united in support for HS2 being built as soon as possible.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Its reading of 52.9, up from 50.0 in December, was also at a 16-month high, while the rebound in manufacturing to an eight-month high of 49.5 was not enough to tip over the line into expansion.Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg\u0026nbspBank, said that the jump in the PMI for January provides yet more evidence that UK economic activity has started to turn up sharply since the election.“Brexit progress, the promise of a big fiscal stimulus in spring, and the end of the risk that far-left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn could one day become prime minister have lifted confidence and lowered uncertainty,” he said.Market traders pared back their prediction of the likelihood of a rate cut from 70 per cent on Friday to less than 50 per cent after the release of the\u0026nbspPMI data.Simon Wells, chief European economist\u0026nbspat HSBC, said that, on balance, he believed the PMI survey would keep the Bank of England on hold at the last meeting of its monetary policy committee to be chaired by outgoing governor Mark Carney.However, he added: “Before the market races to price out any chance of rate cuts this year, it is worth keeping in mind that GDP and retail sales data were very weak, and inflation has been soft.“The PMI is still consistent with a 0.2 per cent quarterly GDP growth rate, in line with the BoE\u0027s November forecast, and still fairly sluggish. We therefore still think a rate cut could happen in May, although January now looks less likely.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This was the lowest since the aftermath of the global financial crisis in the final quarter of 2009 when it hit 9.5 per cent.The fall was driven by a sharp fall in profits in the North Sea oil and gas, that slimmed to 1.3 per cent from 2.3 per cent as the prices of both fuels fell in the third quarter.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, the drop in profits was witnessed across business with services firms suffering a 0.4 points fall to 15.2 per cent and manufacturers down by a steeper 0.9 points to 11.1 per cent.Earlier this week figures showed the number of firms issuing profits warnings hit a four-year high in the final quarter of last year, according to business advisers EY.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gabriella Zaghari-Ratcliffe stands next to her father Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and his mother Barbara, as they address the media in Downing Street following a meeting with Prime Minister Boris JohnsonRosa Connolly takes a close look during a preview of the Tyrannosaurs exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland, EdinburghThe sun sets behind tower cranes and the London skyline in the city financial districtPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, speaks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson as they attend the UK-Africa Investment Summit at the Intercontinental Hotel in London.

The share of companies warning in 2019 hit 17.8 per cent, just surpassing 2008’s figure at the peak of the financial crisis. A third of FTSE-listed retailers issued warnings in 2019.The figures came as the retail industry said shops shed 57,000 jobs in 2019 as employment in the once-vibrant high street and shopping centre contracted for the fourth successive year.The British Retail Consortium said the total number of retail employees fell by 1.8 per cent in the final three months of 2019 compared with a year earlier.

Her husband grows rice during the rainy season and the rest of the time performs duties as a marabou (fortune teller). Djifanghor, 27, is a single mother who lives alone in the village of Niaguis with her mother. After her father died in 2008 her eldest brother was forced to work away to protect the family income. Belange, 23, lives in the village of Soutoure, near Kolda. Her parents have always traditionally farmed rice \u0026amp peanut crops but have noticed the rainy season is unstable – sometimes there is more rain and sometimes there is not enough. Elie, 27, along with her family fled Oussouye in the Ziguinchor Region of Senegal in 1998 at the height of the conflict. She recalls stories of how the rebel groups lit fuel around shelters and make-shift homes and those residents who tried to escape were shot. “I still hear the crying and screams of those who perished … that is still what I have in my mind”. Dry inlet at Mandina village near Sedhiou. In recent years water reserves where Cattle used to graze the lush grass at the bank has dropped significantly. All that remains are the discarded nets from a once active fishing area for locals, now a vast area of cracked mud and salt crystals.Khady, 32, lives 4km from Ziguinchor. She participated in both the Agricultural Training camp in December 2018 and spent 3 months at the Incubation camp where she learnt how to transform her crops.A dry inlet bed at Mandina near Sedhiou, where cattle once grazed the lush vegetation on the banks – now all that remains are their footprints and hoof marksAlima, 31, says her ancestors have always been farmers: “My mother, my grandmother and my great grandmother all were, but they farmed very differently. They would grow rice, maize and millet only, whereas we are choosing what is easier for us to grow. We can now make more profit than in the past.” Cezi, 29, lives in Carounate, near Ziguinchor. Her father was killed in 1995 during the conflict when she was just 4 years old. “A lot of people were killed on the same day in my area, houses were destroyed and several families were forced to move away. “My schooling was affected – I felt ashamed when the others talked about their fathers and I didn’t have one. It all affected my studies.” She explains how hard the period was for her family, in particular her mother. “She used to drink alcohol as she said it was the only way to forget the ‘bad souvenirs’ (memories) from that day.” Cezi is one of 11 family members at home.The Ampa Awagna project since its introduction in 2017 has trained 354 students in agricultural techniques and empowered 90 participants with the knowledge and skill to start their own companies. Projects like these are monumental in a region where 72 per cent of young people live on less than £1.50 per day. Famatou, 32, lives in the village of Saleykegna. She has struggled in the past to provide enough food for her family to eat. She explained how she had heard the Ampa Awagna project was providing small scale farmers with improved techniques growing crops to increase yields. Since her training, her onions have doubled in size and she has the ability to earn well and provide for her five children. “I get one production and I can earn 35,000 CFA (£54). I’m very happy now that my vegetable garden is doing better. I hope it will continue to be successful, otherwise, this will affect my family, I just love to see my garden grow.”Aida, 36, lives in Takou village, near Sedhiou. She has five children and is 8 months pregnant but still works tirelessly on her small holding and with her chickens. The family only eat twice a day but Aida has a business plan to grow her poultry farm. “My mother used to grow rice and peanuts just for food. People still do grow these here but only in the rainy season, which is very short. Lydie, 25, lives in Boukitingho near Ziguinchor. She attended the Ampa Awagna Y CareYMCA course and learned how to upscale the vegetables she grows by turning produce from the market into syrup, juice and marmalade. This enables her to earn a more consistent income the whole year-round. She is already teaching other women in the village the new skills she learned at the course. “We have a joint piece of land in the village where we can grow our crops, and there we grow carrots, salad, onions and maize.Y Care International, the YMCA’s aid and development charity, is empowering young women across the world and is supporting a programme in Senegal to address youth unemployment and help the next generation of farmers adapt to climate change. Beneficiaries like Fatou are able to create sustainable lives for themselves and their families.Bouya, 23, lives in a village on the outskirts of Kolda. An orphan, she lost both her parents to illness. Until now Bouya has been totally dependent on her uncle for support. “I’ve just completed the agricultural training camp at Ampa Awagna and I am now planning to develop my own smallholding. The plot of land belonged to my father.  My idea is to start growing okra, lettuce, tomato and cucumber – okra is a great crop because it is resistant to the heat.Laurentine, 26, runs a smallholding of pigs near Kolda. She is using the new farming methods she learnt on the Ampa Awangna camp and is extremely positive about the future. “Before the training, we used traditional methods. The programme taught me the modern way is to keep them in the shelter as when they wander around they can bring back diseases”. She now has 40 pigs and hopes in the next 10 years to move to a much larger holding where she wants 200-300 pigs.Belange, 23, lives in the village of Soutoure, near Kolda. Having excelled at the initial 2-week agricultural training camp at Ampa Awagna, Belange was asked to complete the 50-day intensive agricultural camp. She explained: “When I returned, I started growing in my vegetable garden, rearing pigs and poultry. I am earning much more than I did before the training. I’m growing tomatoes, peppers and chillis and I have much more output. Our life is better now – we don’t need to get help from others or have to ask people for money.”Khady, 32, watering her crops of Aubergine and Ochre near Ziguinchor. Watering the crops to ensure they produce the best yields takes several hours a day.A beneficiary of the Y CareYMCA Ampa Awagna, Belange, 23 stands marking the spot, where the rice harvest should have reached. The deficit in rice crop yields (the staple diet) reported by several farmers or total crop-losses due to inconsistent rainfall have pushed vulnerable households with depleted food stocks to begin using negative coping strategies such as decreasing the number of meals per day for the family. Alphonse George Manga, regional executive secretary for YMCA Senegal, explained: “We are in a changing world, we can’t stay in the past. For this century things are changing for the better for women. I think in the future there will be a role reversal. Where previously, women were required to stay at home, they are now far more skilled and empowered. They can do and be whatever they want if they are just given a chance and a little bit of help.”Fatou, 30, comes from a family of farmers approximately 20km away from the village of Bousra where she now lives with her son Ibu.

The Movement of Democratic Forces in Casamance (MFDC) emerged in 1982 as an armed separatist group advocating for independence, creating a guerilla force who began attacks on the Senegalese army in 1990.In lower Casamance, 78 villages were completely destroyed, creating\u0026nbspover 60,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) and subjected them to a life of fewer opportunities. Tens of thousands also crossed borders seeking refuge in Guinea-Bissau and the Gambia.Although an eventual ceasefire was implemented in 2014, today few MFDC combatants remain and violent incidents are in decline. The fear of sporadic attacks has now been replaced by far greater fears of youth unemployment and food insecurities driven by the changing climate.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHigh levels of poverty and hunger persist in Senegal despite solid economic growth in recent years. Chronic malnutrition affects\u0026nbspapproximately 17 per cent of children younger than 5 years of age, according to the UN World Food Program.Countries in the Sahel who rely on agriculture as primary sources of food and income are most at risk of crises and disasters.

You erased a continent.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnd in a video statement, the 23-year-old added that, for the first time in her life, she now “understood the definition of the word racism”.The cropped image was made available to news outlets across the world after being taken by the Associated Press news agency following a press call in the Swiss town.It said it had removed Ms Nakate only to improve the picture’s composition and it had not acted with “ill intent”.David Ake, director of photography, said: “The photographer was trying to get a picture out fast under a tight deadline and cropped it purely on composition grounds because he thought the building in the background was distracting.“When we went back to add more pictures to the report, which we almost always do when we are working under very tight deadlines, we added additional pictures with different crops.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester holds a sign reading On the move mocking the LREM party\u0027s slogan during a demonstration in Paris, as part as a nationwide multi-sector strike against the French government\u0027s pensions overhaulA Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

The video has since gone viral and the oil worker shared an update on the kittens’ health.Writing on Facebook, Mr Diwisch said: “So today I found these three fellows on one of the back roads near one of my wells. Most likely dropped off. Poor things were frozen into the ice so they had to have been there all night.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlines“All three little rascals went to their new home today where they get to be together instead of separating them. All three are eating and drinking and very energetic. Thanks for everyone’s consideration and offering to take them very appreciated.”The video, captured last Wednesday, shows Mr Diwisch approaching the poor kittens in the snow. He can be heard talking on camera, saying: “Look at these little guys. It’s alright, it’s ok. You’re frozen to the ice. Have you been here all night?”One of the cats is free but his friends have their tails frozen to the ground. Once Mr Diwisch sees this he goes to his truck, brings back warm coffee, pours it on the felines and is able to get them free.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester holds a sign reading On the move mocking the LREM party\u0027s slogan during a demonstration in Paris, as part as a nationwide multi-sector strike against the French government\u0027s pensions overhaulA Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

They advocate vastly increasing on-site inspections and government oversight of all wildlife markets.The New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society, meanwhile, appealed for an end to wildlife markets everywhere, not just in China.Zoonotic diseases, or those contracted by humans that originated in other species, account for a large share of human infectious illnesses. Not all of them come from the wildlife trade: rabies is endemic across many species and one of the biggest causes of death in the developing world. But mixing species of wild animals increases the risk of diseases mutating and growing more virulent as they spread in unregulated markets, experts say.Canada confirms first case of coronavirus, as death toll rises to 54The emergence of such diseases is a “numbers game,” said Christian Walzer, executive director of the Wildlife Conservation Society\u0027s health program.“If these markets persist, and human consumption of illegal and unregulated wildlife persists, then the public will continue to face heightened risks from emerging new viruses, potentially more lethal and the source of future pandemic spread,” Mr Walzer said. “These are perfect laboratories for creating opportunities for these viruses to emerge.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It also called for stepped up inspections and for raising public awareness about the risks of eating them.Researchers have not yet announced a definitive source for this latest outbreak, which like many other viruses can infect multiple species.One of the first measures taken by Wuhan authorities was to close down the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where 41 of the first cases originated.“That\u0027s the big black box right now,” said Jon Epstein, an epidemiologist with the Ecohealth Alliance.He was in China following the SARS outbreak and helped the ongoing global effort over nearly two decades to find the wild source of that virus, which sickened more than 8,000 and killed less than 800. SARS has been linked to various animals, including bats and the cat-like masked palm civet.Bats are known to harbour coronaviruses, but scientists have yet to fully understand the new virus and how it leapt from animals to people.Dr Epstein said researchers suspect but haven\u0027t proven that the Wuhan virus came from bats. Before it infected humans, it likely first jumped to an as yet unidentified mammal.To stop the coronavirus, the world must resist complacency and panicSpread of coronavirus ‘accelerating’, warns China presidentCoronavirus: How is the deadly virus different to SARS and Ebola?“There\u0027s no plausible evidence to support snakes being involved with this virus,” Dr Epstein said, referring to recent media speculation criticised by a recent article in Nature. Researchers don\u0027t know which species exactly were sold in the Wuhan market, but Dr Epstein said mammals commonly found in such markets—such as ferret badgers, racoon dogs or civets—might be involved in the transmission of the new virus to people.The crackdown on wildlife trafficking and sales persisted only about six months after the SARS outbreak faded in mid-2003, Mr Walzer said.“The solution is simple,” he said. “In the sense that we know where the problem is.”In cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, there\u0027s little sign of markets catering to gourmands seeking “ye wei,” or “wild flavours.”But in provincial cities and in some parts of Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia and other Southeast Asian countries, those determined to eat such exotic dishes can find all sorts of creatures for sale: pangolins, badgers, salamanders, scorpions, hedgehogs and even wolf puppies.A photo of a menu list from a vendor in the Wuhan market called “Wild Game Livestock for the Masses,” circulated online, showed more than 110 species for sale.Court records show that authorities in Hubei, the province where Wuhan is located, investigated 250 cases related to wildlife trafficking and poaching in 2019 alone. According to local media reports, since 2018 an estimated 16,000 wild animals were hunted in the province of more than 60 million people.Coronavirus: How is the deadly virus different to SARS and Ebola?Australia confirms first cases of deadly coronavirusBritons urged to leave Wuhan but ministers won\u0027t commit to airliftsHubei is home to Shennongjia, a UNESCO World Heritage nature reserve that is a habitat of great bioersity with many rare species including the clouded leopard, golden snub-nosed monkey and the Chinese giant salamander.Video footage filmed by a conservation activist in eastern China\u0027s Zhejiang and Anhui provinces, which also have a long tradition of consuming wild species, showed many wild species laid out for inspection in a market.In most cases, vendors are registered to sell some unprotected species, usually a limited amount of just a few, such as hares, wild boar and muntjac, a kind of tiny deer.But enforcement is “not that strict,” said Tian Jiang Ming of the Anti-Poaching Squad, a group of volunteers who visit markets are report on illegal wildlife sales. The illegal offerings tend to be kept hidden away in back freezers, he said.“The vendors are selling illegally poached animals with these licenses in hand,” he told The Associated Press.Only in 2014 did China criminalise consumption of protected species with a law specifying a maximum three-year jail term. But it also has allowed commercial farming of certain species, including tigers — a practice that conservation advocates say encourages illicit trafficking in protected species.It\u0027s difficult to secure prosecution since it\u0027s hard to prove animals have been poached, Tian Jiang Ming said.“The forestry department needs to prove illegal poaching by the sellers but they don\u0027t have the investigative resources to find them,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Two of the three people who have been diagnosed with the virus in France arrived in the country without showing symptoms, doctors at a Paris hospital told reporters.However, French officials have said they feel that the threat of a full-blown outbreak remains low in Europe.Leading physician Dr Yazdan Yazdanpanah said cases imported from China were “not a surprise” and that France had prepared, including by developing a test that provides rapid results for suspected cases.On the other hand, he said, the chance of “an epidemic in France or in Europe is weak, extremely weak”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We have found out which stalls on the seafood market in Wuhan had the virus. It is an important discovery, and we will investigate which animal was the source.\u0026nbspOf the 585 samples collected by scientists, 33 tested positive for the virus. They came from 22 stalls and a waste vehicle, most of which were in the area of the market where animals were often traded.Mr Tan cited research suggesting the coronavirus\u0026nbspis 90 per cent similar to a virus found on the body of a bat species in Zhejiang. Other studies have identified snakes and badgers as possible sources.Another 1,000 virus cases expected, says Wuhan mayor\u0026nbspThe mayor of the city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak has said he expects another 1,000 new patients.\u0026nbspZhou Xianwang said Wuhan\u0027s government will step up construction of specialised hospitals to deal with the infected.\u0026nbspImages of hospital corridors packed with people seeking treatment have circulated widely on Chinese social media, and residents have complained of soaring prices on essentials such as vegetables.\u0026nbspHowever Mr Zhou insisted that the city\u0027s food prices are stable and there are ample supplies.\u0026nbspHe claimed that the pressure on supplies of medical goods such as protective suits, masks and glasses had largely eased due to increased numbers of donations.Taiwan tightens restrictions on Chinese visitors\u0026nbspThe country has suspended\u0026nbspentry for many apart from some business travellers and a few other exceptions like people married to Taiwanese citizens.Taiwan has close economic and cultural links with China and has so far reported four cases of the new coronavirus. Taiwan has already stopped Chinese tour groups from visiting, and has now banned all people from Hubei from coming to the island.\u0026nbspChinese officials yesterday announced they would be halting all international group tours as of Monday.Meanwhile, Japan is preparing to repatriate its citizens in Wuhan as soon as possible.\u0026nbspSome 430 Japanese nationals have been confirmed to be living or staying in Hubei province, with almost all of them in Wuhan, the epicentre of China\u0027s coronavirus outbreak, the country\u0027s foreign minister Toshimitsu Motegi revealed.Briefing reporters after he spoke on the telephone with his Chinese counterpart, Mr Motegi said China\u0027s foreign minister, Wang Yi, told him that he understood Japan\u0027s concern and desire to repatriate its nationals as soon as possible.I told Mr Wang that if there is anything Japan could do to help prevent the spread of the disease, we are ready to offer our full support, he told reporters.Hong Kong confirms three more cases as pressure mounts to tighten border with mainland China\u0026nbspEight people have now been diagnosed with the coronavirus in the city, including one man who had been allowed to leave a public hospital where he was receiving treatment for dog bites, which staff were aware he had received in Wuhan.\u0026nbsp107 people have reportedly been put in quarantine in hospitals in the city, but there is increasing pressure for Carrie Lam to restrict the border with China.\u0026nbspWhile one medical union threatened doctors would strike if the government refused to close the border, the Hospital Authority\u0027s director of quality and safety, Dr Chung Kin-lai, urged caution.“I don’t want to see that happening as I know the impact could be enormous,” the South China Morning Post reported Dr Chung as saying. “I hope they can give it thorough thought, and we will be open-minded in communicating with colleagues.”Third case confirmed in US\u0026nbspA new case of the virus has been confirmed in southern California. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention notified local health officials in Orange County that a Wuhan local had tested positive for the virus.\u0026nbspIn the US, two other cases have been confirmed, in Illinois and Washington, while on Sunday the virus was discovered to have reached Canada.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailAnd even if they were illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, or third- or fourth-generation migrants, neither the municipal authorities nor the local police has the jurisdiction to act in the way it did – that would be a matter for the federal authorities.Adavi said the incident was particularly concerning because it came just days after the local BJP legislative assembly member (MLA) for the area, Aravind Limbavali, tweeted a video of the settlement, saying it was “without cleanliness ... a site of illegal activity” and housing people who “are suspect to be illegal immigrants of Bangladesh”.Adavi said there was clearly a link between the evictions in Bengaluru and a broader anti-immigrant “sense across India right now”, with the government recently passing a citizenship law for refugees that excludes Muslims, and the exercise of creating a register of legal citizens (NRC) in Assam state.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester holds a sign reading On the move mocking the LREM party\u0027s slogan during a demonstration in Paris, as part as a nationwide multi-sector strike against the French government\u0027s pensions overhaulA Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

Local media reported that several people are feared trapped as the rescue operation continuesMohammed Riyadh Ul Islam, 24, told NDTV he had been forced to stay this week in a hut that already housed two others before the demolitions, saying his home was destroyed on Sunday.He agreed that “if there are Bangladeshis here, it is the job of police to do an inquiry and remove them”.Siddaramaiah, the former chief minister of Karnataka, called the evictions and demolition “an inhumane act by the BJP government”.And VS Ugrappa, a spokesperson for the opposition Congress party, said: “God only knows what happens to the people who are there. It is nothing but a jungle raj and ultimately the government has to be held responsible.”When approached by the Deccan Herald newspaper, a senior police officer at the station local to Kariyammana Agrahara suggested it was up to the slum residents to provide verification for their own ID documents, adding:\u0026nbsp “What is the guarantee that these documents are genuine?”He said previous attempts by officers to travel to West Bengal and verify migrant workers’ documents had been met with non-compliance by the state authorities there.D Randeep, head of the local branch of the municipal authority, said in a statement that “no senior officials were informed beforehand” about the evictions. He said the engineer whose letter to police sparked the action would face unspecified “action” and that a detailed report would be produced on Sunday’s events.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Prince Charles will see to that.Harry will continue to receive £million from his father, but although Charles has amassed a personal fortune of over £million, the money might not be coming from that closely guarded pot.The prince could instead be paying him through a outdated racket called the Duchy of Cornwall.Charles could claim this as a business expense which means he can reduce the amount of tax he pays. The public would be paying for Harry by the back door.Harry of course has no connection with this sprawling property company called the Duchy, but that has never stopped Charles benefiting from its special tax status.The status of the Duchy has been contested for decades and while Charles insists it is private, thats strongly disputed by others.Charles has also claimed as business expenses the cost of  personal staff to pamper him – butlers, valets, gardeners.He had the cheek to argue that Camilla’s personal costs even before they married were a Duchy expense so claimed for her staff, her travel, her jewellery, and the stabling of her horses.And he got away with it. The line was only drawn when he tried to claim his polo ponies as business expenses.In my time in Parliament I saw plenty of MPs claiming for duck houses, moat cleaning and the like. Is this dferent So what is this Duchy  Well it’s not just in Cornwall where it has land. Its tentacles stretch far and wide. It even owns the Oval cricket ground. Extra cover for the Prince as he hits the taxpayer for six.The Duchy turns in a profit of over £million a year. That is money that many argue should go straight to the Treasury. Instead it becomes pocket money for the Prince.He has reluctantly agreed he should pay tax on this money but the vast array of creative expenses he conjures up means in a recent year when the Duchy made £.million, only £.million was paid in tax at  per cent.That can only be explainedhe dreamed up more than £million in expenses.Charles says the Duchy is a “private estate” — which it is legally, but it acts like a public body that reverts to the Crown when theres no Duke of Cornwall.It has had notices served on it by the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency and they can only be served on a public body.It is the harbour authority for the Isles of Scilly. The Information Commissioner has ruled it is public.But by insisting it is private means the Duchy’s accounting practices can be hidden away. No right of access for the National Audit Office. No freedom of information.If you go cap in hand and bow and scrape, they might let you see some old Duchy paperwork. On the other hand, they might not.In this medieval throwback, Charles scoops up the property of anybody who dies without leaving a will. The general right for a King or Queen to do this was abolished in . But not in the Duchy.Yet this so-called private estate suddenly becomes public when it suits Charles. Unlike any other private estate in Britain, it doesn’t pay any corporation tax or capital gains tax.No wonder Charles is worth over £million.Suddenly the private Prince becomes a public figure, demanding – and getting – the right to change government legislation that affects the Duchy in a way he doesn’t like.To be fair, he does pay the market rent for the vast property he occupies at Highgrove. He pays it to the Duchy which then s the money to him, tax-free, as the Duke of Cornwall in a sort of merry money-go-round.He got Duchy employees to grow trees on Duchy land and then sold the timber to... The Duchy. Charles pocketed £.million tax free for this racket.The Duchy of Cornwall is not some hobby growing a bit of organic lettuce here and there. Nor is it a small collection of twee cottages as you might infer from the pictures the Duchy uses in its publications.No, it is a hard-headed ruthless property company with advantages in tax and law that no other company has.It is a massive money-making machine for Prince Charles, money that rightly belongs to us all but that he erts to himself.It’s time for this medieval monstrosity to be sorted out.

Which they are on ­commercial rivals like Nick Ferrari on LBC or Julia Hartley-Brewer on TalkRADIO.At least those stations don’t start from a position of: “Brexit is evil and a majority Tory government isn’t much ­better.”No one is proposing for a single second the BBC be axed. But the poll tax that funds it should be.Its websites that write clickbait about TV shows like Love Island — well ­covered by other online outlets — should be stopped too. Not to mention its recent push into the already saturated podcast market.The BBC’s job is not to be a monolith, shutting out commercial organisations and dominating the entertainment and news industries.That’s what makes yesterday’s decision to axe Victoria Derbyshire’s BBC programme ridiculous.Her award-winning morning show is one of the only news programmes on the ­corporation to properly cover the working class.It is unbiased, feisty, fair and will cover entertainment stories or whatever happens to be the splash of The Sun that day, without the snobbery of the rest of BBC News.That sort of non-commercial show is just the type the Beeb should be making. But — of course — under its latest cuts, it is the first to go.The next Director-General must be an outsider who understands the madness of the BBC’s current priorities and is ­prepared to enact real change.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And climate change, whether the prince wants to acknowledge it or not, is an innately political issue.Two of the world’s biggest players – the US and China – are nowhere close to where we are on the so-called crisis.It’s up to Boris Johnson to criticise them and for Charles to calm them down with ceremonial State visits.Sure, Charles should be offering his support and sympathy to the people of Australia impacted by bushfires, for example.Perhaps he could even visit the area and talk about the damage.But offering a ten-point solution politicians should enact is insane – especially given he flew to Davos on a £, private jet trip that emitted six tonnes of carbon.If the hypocritical prince is so impetuous that he can’t see the time has come for his role to change, I genuinely fear for the Royal Family.The last thing the country needs is another two-bit political wannabe trying to gain popularity on the back of Greta.What we desperately need is a future king who can bring us together beyond politics and beyond the embarrassing PR mess engulfing his family.CHRIS MARTIN swore at fans this week who were trying to get his autograph following a Coldplay gig in LA.Shocking, isn’t it  Who asks for an autograph these days How vintage. ORLANDO BLOOM will voice Prince Harry in a comedy cartoon called The Prince for US broadcaster HBO, which is set to poke fun at our calamitous royals.I hope the actor has put in the hours perfecting how to whinge relentlessly. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The project is already massively over budget, it may well break the £billion mark soon, and running a decade late.A row about what to do about it is brewing in the Tory party.“HS is building up to be quite a serious disagreement within the party,” says one leading backbencher.Birmingham Tories are keen to save the scheme, believing it to be key to the re-election prospects of their West Midlands Mayor Andy Street.One argument they are deploying is that going ahead with HS would make it easier for the Government to scrap the third runway at Heathrow.They point out that when David Cameron backed the scheme while the Tories were in opposition, it was, in part, as an alternative to Heathrow expansion.Given that Boris Johnson has said he would lie down in front of the bulldozers before he allowed a third runway to be built, it would be extremely embarrassing for himthe project proceeded.But for a Prime Minister, who boasts of his commitment to infrastructure, to scrap two of the biggest transport projects in the country would be politically dficult. This might well be what saves HS, in some form.This Government knows what it wants to do.But the real challenge is actually delivering on this agenda, of ensuring that, when Boris Johnson pulls the levers, something happens.I UNDERSTAND that Boris Johnson is keen to amalgamate the Department for International Development and the Foreign Office this year.His experience as Foreign Secretary has left him convinced that you need to align the two departments.The UK will, though, remain committed to spending . per cent of national income on foreign aid.In preparation for this beefed-up role for the Foreign Office, I’m told Rob Oxley – the Prime Minister’s Press Secretary – is heading there to work for Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary.Oxley was with Boris and Dominic Cummings on the Vote Leave campaign before working with them in Downing Street.He is a trusted member of their team and his presence in the Foreign Office will ensure smooth relations between Downing Street and the FCO.He is also across the international issues, having previously been a special adviser at both the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development.KEIR STARMER is out in front in the Labour leadership race.He has four times as many nominations from constituency Labour parties as any other candidate. Right now, this race is his to lose.If Starmer does win, it will consolidate a change in British politics. He will find it easier to squeeze Liberal Democrat voters in the south than to win back those Leave voters Labour have lost in the Midlands and the North in recent years. Labour’s sht to being a party of urban graduates will continue under him.The problem for Labour is that this approach simply will not win them enough seats to govern.In a generation’s time, it may well work. But not now. Starmer’s supporters argue that he comes without Jeremy Corbyn’s baggage and that many of the voters Labour lost at the last election will come back to the party as soon as they are offered a credible leader. This, though, seems an optimistic reading of events.One supporter of another candidate claims that the sense Starmer “looks the part” and “you can imagine him as PM” is just because he is a man. “Never underestimate the sexism of the Labour party,” she complains.NIGEL FARAGE will vote for the withdrawal agreement when it comes before the European Parliament next week. Farage had previously been a trenchant critic of the deal.He has described it as “awful”, “ per cent the same as Mrs May’s deal” and “a Remainer’s Brexit”. But he’s been convinced by the Government’s statements about how it doesn’t intend to be a rule-taker after Brexit.For this reason – and because it would look absurd for him to vote against Brexit – he will now back the deal. Farage plans to leave UK politics on January . But he intends to keep a watching brief, saying he is prepared toto the frayBoris Johnson’s government pulls back from its current position.Farage’s experience with the Brexit Party, which went from launch to topping the poll in the European elections in a matter of weeks, has persuaded him that new political parties can have an instant impact when required.THE row over a potential peerage for John Bercow is not going to go away. He is claiming he is entitled to one.But the Government is keen to stop the former Speaker getting one given how he twisted parliamentary procedure to aid those MPs who were trying to block Boris Johnson on Brexit.Meanwhile, the former chief clerk of the House of Commons, Lord Lisvane, has made a formal complaint alleging that Bercow bullied staff.One MP who Bercow appointed to the  of chairs tells me the most likely outcome to the row is that the House of Lords Appointments Commission does not accept Jeremy Corbyn’s nomination of Bercow.But rather than rejecting it outright, it will say “not now” and insist that all proceedings relating to Bercow’s alleged bullying are dealt with before a decision is made on whether he can go to the Lords or not.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Network Rail wants to move a mile-long stretch of track that runs beside a beach in Devon, saying it’s vulnerable to falling rocks AND pounding waves.Protesters say this is nonsense, and they’re right. Simple as.Yes, the track is vulnerable. In  it was destroyed by a storm and, while it was being repaired, Cornwall was effectively cut off from the rest of the country.But this bit of track, designed and built by Brunel, is extremely pretty and charming and that, in the coming years, is going to matter more than a few Corns being cut off for a week or two.As we leave Europe, we have in our minds that we will be a modern, dynamic nation with magnetic levitation transportation systems linking all the towns and villages. We see glass towers piercing the clouds in Rochdale and space ports in Basingstoke.Ain’t going to happen.If we decide that everything old-fashioned and historical must go to make le more modern, then we can wave goodbye to the Tower of London, because that piece of real estate should obviously be sold to commercial developers.They say the submersibles these people use are causing “untold damage” to the ship.Hmm. Not half as much damage as the iceberg did, I’ll wager.The Roman walls in York  Stupid. Replace them with nuclear free peace cafes. Stonehenge  Smash it up and build polytunnels.And while we are at it, we can turn Portmeirion into a wind farm, capitalise on the crescent in Bath with advertising hoardings and replace all the dry stone walls in the Yorkshire Dales with plastic fencing.Oh, and then there’s the Royal Family.It’s obviously idiotic to have a system of government where you can become head of state just because you’re the first-born child of a German woman and a Greek man. So let’s get rid of that and have a president instead. That way, we could have someone we know in Buckingham Palace. Piers Morgan perhaps. Or Phillip Schofield.The fact is that Britain is a boutique.Millions of foreign visitors come every year to marvel at our pomp and tradition. They love our changing of the guard, and our castles and our awkward Elizabethan houses. They laugh at us when we try to be modern but lap up our Rolls-Royces and our Bentleys which are made, by Germans, to feel as old-fashioned as the Queen’s underwear drawer.We send a young, fresh band to the Eurovision Song Contest and it comes last. Then the judges go home to listen to The Beatles and The Who.We need to capitalise on that. We need the red telephone boxes back. We need warty peasants on every street corner and lots of men tipping their bowler hats when they see a lady.Because then, tourists will be queuing round the block to give us their dollars and their dongs.And we can start by leaving that pretty bit of railway line in Devon alone.Yes, it’ll mean that from time to time Cornwall will be cut off. But I’m willing to bet a lot of Corns won’t mind that. Because being isolated and stuck and hungry is part of what we are as well.This week she stood still and insisted Prince Charles crossed the room to greet her. And after they had shaken hands and exchanged pleasantries, she turned to the photographers and called a halt to proceedings.I’m not sure she had a clue who Charlie Boy was. But then she doesn’t have much of a clue about anything.A FEW weeks ago, many people were upset when I suggested that God had set fire to Australia.I realise now that this was a stupid thing to say. Of course God did not set fire to it. The Green movement did.Yes, climate change causes longer, hotter spells that increase the likelihood of a fire starting. But what made it became so huge was ill-informed eco thinking.In recent years, Australians have faced huge finesthey cut down a tree or even collect fallen branches.This means that when a fire starts, it has a ton of dry wood to get its teeth into. The Aboriginals understood this. The early white settlers did too. That’s why they had controlled fires to manage the land properly.Sadly, though, ecomentals don’t understand this.So, by trying to save the country’s wildle, they’ve ended up incinerating it.However, it turns out that Land Rover was able to work out that, on the night in question, the car had been at the scene.Obviously, it’s great that technology can be used in this way. But I have a Range Rover and I’m not sure I like thinking that some herbert in Solihull knows where I am  hours a day. CHANNEL  News achieved new heights of unbalanced reporting this week while covering a pro-gun march in America.Instead of asking protesters why they wanted a machine gun, and then allowing the viewer to make up their mind, the reporter pounced on a family and asked the children why they were there.Needless to say, the kids had no clue and turned in baffled silence to their parents.I’m willing to bet, however, thatyou asked kids on an eco march why they were there, you’d get exactly the same response.But would Channel  News do that  Don’t hold your breath.I told the woman my name was Jeremy Clarkson. I told her the name on my credit card was Jeremy Clarkson. And that my account was in the name of Jeremy Clarkson.And when I’d finished, she said, with some excitement: “Hey!!

The pressure on wages, the NHS, housing and so on is unsustainable.But it is already sharply down on . And even the prospect of ending free movement has dramatically relegated immigration in the list of the nation’s priorities.We MUST, though, be far tougher on illegals who reach our shores, and vastly increase the tiny percentage we deport.That will end the deadly trafficking racket. And none are genuine refugees — or they would stay put in the EU which, as tearful Europhiles will tell you, is a welcoming, safe, liberal paradise.Britain must continue to rescue real refugees from warzone camps.Economic migrants from the EU, like everywhere , can come in on merit.THE Government is right to condemn America over Harry Dunn.It is taking our special relationship for granted.It tries to bully us over taxes on its tech giants, issues threats over Huawei and outrageously hides a death crash driver. Britain is right to push back.The US insists Anne Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity. But it could rescind that. It simply refuses.President Trump presumably thinks he must side with US citizens come what may. But most of them also believe Mrs Sacoolas should face justice.She won’tvoluntarily. She doesn’t want to — and says a potential jail term wouldn’t be “proportional”.That is for a judge to decide. Mrs Sacoolas’s apparent negligence killed a young man. Even accidents have consequences.If she or Trump have any sense of right and wrong, she will be flown back.THE historic Brexit Bill is signed off.

She gives her take on how an inability to retain independence left Meghan feeling vulnerable.Jo also reveals how free-spirited Meghan was not always able to make the compromises necessary to accept the constraints of royal le and analyses the “boyfriend shirt” she wore when first dating Harry . . . plus the Hamsa ring she put on to ward off evil.I ALWAYS feel deeply unsettled when my own feelings of love, goodwill and optimism are turned on a sixpence in exchange for scepticism, cynicism and disappointment.It indicates very strongly that I feel cheated and, perhaps worst of all, fooled.It is no exaggeration to say that this has been the personal rollercoaster of emotions I have been on with Meghan and Harry.I vividly remember standing in my garden that sweltering day during May , looking through the living-room window to watch their royal weddingand welling up with the emotion and promise of it all.Strangely, I don’t recall experiencing the same when William and Kate married seven years earlier, but there was something truly signicant about Meghan joining The Firm.She signied new, fresh, modern, showbizzy blood — and abundant, gracious, progressive attitudes.Above all , the love they had for each other was palpable.Perhaps I should already have been exercising some caution with my enthusiasm when Harry fired warning shots across the media about the treatment of his girlfriend and the supposed racist undertones.But I, for one, felt utterly encouraged and buoyant about this woman’s humility, dignity, compassion and empathy.What could possibly go wrong Now,  months down the line, I cannot deny I feel hoodwinked — and can well imagine that is how much of the population feels.As a nation of welcoming Brits , it is like we invited Meghan into our adorable, unpretentious and homely BB. She stayed for dinner, took the complimentary soaps and shampoos then walked out in search of the nearest hotel.Regardless of how they want to dress it up, the two of them have turned their backs on the UK and it feels like a kick in the teeth.What really stings is that it does not feel like it was a long-term plan, but it simply came about when Meghan re-read the membership rules, months after signing on the dotted line, and decided it cramped her style. I’m pretty certain all the statutes will have been made clear to her from the start, many times over. Everything will have been scrutinised and pored over in minute detail. The Royal Family is a watertight institution, after all.But propelled by her personal ambition, and presumably a wilfulness to reform the family, becoming a royal would not only give her a  for her humanitarian work but also fame on a level she would have been unlikely to have otherwise ever achieved.What she could not cope with was her loss of control and the fact that being part of a team inevitably means diminished autonomy.But some of her story has echoes of when Sarah Ferguson joined the family back in the Eighties.Fergie was a jolly, fun, self-deprecating young woman who thought she would have the ride of a letime. But she found herself profoundly restricted by her mother-in-law’s budget and her husband’s dullness. Instead of making a dignied exit, she had her toes sucked by another man because le was not as much fun as it had promised to be. It was ugly.The prospect of joining the Royal Family would fill me with horror — and it did so even way back in , when I was pictured alongside HRH Prince Edward at the theatre.I had become good friends with his best friend, James Baker.One night I joined James, Edward and another of his friends to go to the theatre.By sheer coincidence I was “papped” next to the prince.Excited and furious speculation ensued the following day about the mystery Swedish blonde — I was  and not yet on the ladder of fame — and I was quickly dubbed his latest flame. One newspaper even ran the headline “The Prince And The Showgirl” with old photos of me in school drama productions.It was my first experience of such widespread exposure and it came as an absolute shock.HRH was kind enough to phone me to offer his support and urge me to “say nothing”, which I duly did.After some months, the two of us did have a few dates, and while I, a most common commoner, would never have been considered “royal material”, le in The Firm crossed my mind on a few occasions.And it did not especially fill me with joy.I got the strong impression Prince Edward himself would have given anything to get in a car and drive away from it all, which was hardly the greatest endorsement. But despite getting a lot of flak over preceding years for dropping out of the Marines and then pursuing a career in the arts, the prospect of him walking away would never have been one he would have seriously entertained.His sense of duty, loyalty and obligation was too great.I really got a good insight into the restrictive le he led, along with his lack of access to any kind of normality.All the while he was surrounded by rules and traditions, and then there are the courtiers and staff, there to stle and control your many moves, constantly keeping your behaviour in check.I would go to dinner and bring my own bottle of white wine because budget and taste would have dictated a ghastly bottle of Liebfraumilch or some other type of sweet white wine, and thus a less fun evening.Because despite the Royal Family being an international brand, it seemed at the time, at least, that “taste” as such had somehow eluded Prince Edward.He was stuck with whatever the butler would bring and I am guessing money spent on wine was not considered money well spent.The foodwas decidedly plain and a tad dull.Everything in his apartment was so staid and old-fashioned.Nothing had been redecorated for decades and the bathroom had a very quaint old toilet.In my naivety, I had foolishly thought the royals would have the absolute latest in fashion and interiors, but it was like stepping back in time.Perhaps this was how Meghan experienced things, too, but with thoughts and attitudes. I would swear and push the boundaries because I felt it might amuse and maybe inspire more than a touch of reality and authenticity.But the thought of a loon like me being shackled to his le was enough to make me want to run for the hills — regardless of the universal fame that might have been waiting.The idea of a woman as fiercely independent as Meghan being defined and tethered by such an exclusive, traditional club seems, with hindsight, utterly impossible.Her initial sense of goodwill and charitable ambition appears to have been overtaken by her refusal to accept any opinion or critique.I am afraid I know to great personal cost that the limelight can be blinding.But it is a deal you make with yourself and, in her case, it was a deal she made with the British public — to serve.It is not asshe has given it her best shot for seven years and can no longer hack it.This self-defeating move away reeks of impatience, petulance and bitterness.Put simply, her new le became burdensome and an inconvenience when she discovered she could not run her own show.Her father, like mine — who opened his doors to the media when I was photographed next to Prince Edward — became a thorn in her side and she had no tools with which to deal with him.He became an embarrassment a mistake and a mess she could easily have dealt with but felt it more important to proceed with her new le and leave him behind. And then there is Harry: A man smitten and obsessed, a man who has been waiting for a Meghan all his le, someone to nurture him.He has sacriced everything for his we, willingly.He has given up all that he has ever known and everyone he holds dear to chance it all thousands of miles away, isolating himself in pursuit of a le that is not only unclear but precarious.There is no doubt that the Royal Family needs reduction and considerable reform to reflect modern times.But the thought that a newcomer might consider herself best positioned to be that subversive influence would be laughableit was not so hurtful and insulting to much of this country that has been so supportive of this historical institution. The noises from Team Sussex have been distracting, persistent and problematic because the le of a royal is, I am afraid, to toe the line.There is no halfway house, no part-time royalty — the job is not part of the gig economy.By trying to carve out a more contented, niche le for themselves, the Sussexes have made survival considerably more complicated with absolute exposure guaranteed and a letime’s guarantee of judgment and critique.I cannot be the only one who feels painfully disappointed and cheated, beguiled by Hollywood stardust and  promises.And now we are left wondering what the whole shebang was all about, becauseHarry and Meghan thought exiting was challenging, when this all ends in tears — as I fear it will — coming back to the fold will be utterly inconceivable.I DO believe that Meghan married Harry with good intentions and had every belief she could make a positive contribution to the Royal Family.I can also see how Harry, a vulnerable young man who lost his beloved mother at such an early age, could fall in love with a strong, independent woman who could provide some direction.What I do not think Meghan was prepared for was the pressure of doing everything by the book and having to follow so many rules once she had entered into the so-called Firm.The former actress was the first senior royal to have come from a background where she had already established her own successful career.She is an ambitious and determined woman who is not afraid to speak her mind and wants to do things her own way.Meghan is certainly assertive. She is determined in the face of adversity but is also vulnerable and perhaps not as tough as she likes to make out.It is also clear that she became deeply unhappy with royal le and her inability to retain her independence.During all that turmoil, Meghan was not able to publicly speak out about her feelings, so would send subtle messages.She would express how she felt through her jewellery, such as the butterfly earrings she wore shortly after her pregnancy was announced, which symbolised lightness against tension and the sense of hope and endurance.She was also seen wearing a Hamsa ring, used to ward off evil, while in the Canadian embassy. It was the day before the bombshell announcement that they were moving abroad.She often handled her pregnancy bump, wanting consciously or otherwise to draw attention to her developing baby and what it represented moving forward — her new future and family.There is no doubt in my mind that as much as Meghan adores Harry, she had a clear focus in mind from the moment they began to have feelings for each other. There were no coy hints or suggestions from her, as there were with Kate.Nor was she prepared to play the waiting game, hanging on in there until Harry was ready to propose.From the white “boyfriend shirt” she wore right at the beginning of their relationship to the way she looked at Harry and touched him, even in public, Meghan did not shy away from being loud and proud about where she wanted things to head.I think this behaviour stems from a stubborn insecurity that will not go away, and Meghan is not good with situations that are out of her control.Perhaps her coping mechanisms are not as strong as she thought. Maybe she is so determined her family will not suffer like she has in the past that she has become super-protective and frustrated at times.Meghan has had to battle a fair amount of adversity in her le, even before she met Harry.This includes a dficult, and now estranged, relationship with her father and half-sibling, with whom she no longer speaks.I do wonder why she seems to be cut off from her close childhood friends. And why do some of Harry’s oldest pals feel they have been discarded as a result of his relationship with Meghan She is a strong influence on Harry, undoubtedly.Meghan would probably admit that she is strong-willed, not always able to make the sacrices or compromises which are necessary to accept criticism or interference from the Royal Family.Perhaps there is a touch of the narcissist about her, putting her own feelings ahead of the dutul le she signed up to.For example, she seems to find it dficult to understand what her father has been going through or see his perspective.Also, when she told the ITV documentary crew, “It’s not enough to just survive something”, before adding, “You have to thrive”, that shows how important her own happiness and wellbeing is to her.But many strong and influential people have that narcissistic streak. They find it hard to tolerate a situation that makes them feel distressed or to manage a situation over which they have little control.What is interesting is that, following the move to North America, Meghan and Harry have effectively swapped roles.Instead of Meghan being the royal princess at Harry’s side, he will now be more at her behest, having to adapt to a totally dferent sort of le, and one that he could never have imagined.He might feel some resentment in due course, or he may adapt like a duck to water.Will their marriage last They have a tough journey ahead, but I hope so and I wish them well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thirty per cent of university vice-chancellors are women. In , it was just  per cent.But the pace of change is dismally slow.In some areas we have even gone backwards —  per cent of public bodies are chaired by women but in  that figure was  per cent.There are more female MPs than ever but they make up just  per cent of the total number. Just  per cent of peers in the House of Lords are Ladies.Then there are the supposedly family-friendly careers such as education — but just  per cent of secondary school head teachers are female.Perhaps it is less surprising that just over one in  chief executives of FTSE  companies are women, two in six national newspaper editors and one in five bosses of national sport governing bodies.You get the idea.Women make up nearly half the UK workforce but there are nowhere near enough of us in top jobs.Change is not happening nearly swtly enough.Clearly, the best candidates shouldget these jobs but, too often, women are being overlooked by male selection . They are still seen as a burden by some employers.And why  Motherhood.We are still being made redundant or sacked after having babies. Eleven per cent of new mums suffer this fate, according to the Equality and Human Rights Commission.Or  these women are treated so poorly that they feel they have to leave their jobs.This contributes to , women each year losing their employment.In the meantime, almost half of employers think it is quite reasonable, during the recruitment process, to ask female candidates whether or not they have children.Forty-one per cent of employers believe pregnancy in the workplace puts “an unnecessary cost burden” on firms, and that working mums are a burden to their teams.This is a problem.It’s a fact of le that women give birth. So must we simply accept that, until babies can be grown outside the womb, women will be discriminated against at work No.The working mums I employ are among my hardest-working and most productive employees.But STILL we miss out on the top jobs, despite efforts to close the gender gap in industry — and all the positive campaigning.I could not agree more with Sam Smethers, the Fawcett Society’s chief executive, who says: “Despite much lip service being paid to the importance of having women in top jobs, today’s data shows we are still generations away from achieving anything close to equality. We are wasting women’s talent and skills.”In other words, too many big companies are all talk and no action.Smethers thinks we need quotas, targets and policy interventions to remove barriers and promote change.I agree with her.But we also need more research so we can really understand the problem.We need to trust workers when it comes to flexible working and job-sharing.We need to see more men taking parental leave.But perhaps most of all, we need high-quality, affordable childcare so women and men can all go to work knowing that their children are being well looked after.Then we might see some real change.And I struggle to understand what a G-string can shape.What I want from shapewear is maximum coverage, ideally starting under my chin and finishing at my ankles.Let’s face it, that is the only sure way to hold anything in.In Open: Why Asking For Help Can Save Your Le, Frankie tells the story of going straight from shooting the video for The Saturdays’ single My HeartTakes Over in Iceland to being driven to London’s private Nightingale Hospital by her now-husband Wayne, the former England footballer.I really feel for Frankie and it’s awful she had such a hard time.

No one cuts contact with their family lightly.And the fact Thomas has continued to do interviews, despite his daughter’s repeated heartfelt pleas, is a good indication of why she feels she can’t trust him.Mr Markle, it is time to let go. Meghan has.THE story of the retired welder who lamented the fact his phone had not rung for months did not quite make sense to me.Taysider Alan Hattel, , realised his friends had discovered his gravestone had been commissioned by his ex-we – and believed him to be already dead.He said: “My phone has not rung for three or four months.

I was dying in the street.”Lynsey and Scott were waiting for a cab outside her cousin’s home in Greenock when they were suddenly encircled by a gang of thugs.They hurled wine bottles at the innocent couple before Warnock, who was also armed with a kne, launched the shocking attack.She said: “I heard a car door slam and when I looked around, we were surrounded.“They started throwing bottles at me. I went over to ask why they were doing that and somebody shouted, ‘Do the b***h in’.“Warnock tried to chop my head off and he would have managedit hadn’t been for my boyfriend.”The severity of the attack sent Lynsey crashing to the ground as Scott grabbed at the monster’s legs in a brave bid to fend him off.Scott said: “Warnock was standing on a wall with a meat cleaver in his right hand and a kitchen kne in his left.“He started shouting at us. I tried to throw Lynsey out the way, I told her to run.“I used to study taekwondo so I tried to grab a hold of him and sweep his legs.“But I’ve got arthritis in both hands and they weren’t strong enough. That’s when he went for me as well.”Despite blood pouring from a wound above his eye, Scott pulled off his T-shirt in a desperate bid to stem the flow gushing from Lynsey’s neck.He went on: “Every time I got close to her the blood was dripping off me and landing on her.“The gang only ran off when I shouted, ‘You’re going to kill her’.”Panic-stricken Scott then tried to flag down passing cars to help — eventually stopping a taxi driver who called for cops and an ambulance, which arrived within minutes.He added: “If it wasn’t for that ambulance being so close, she wouldn’t have made it.”The dad then had to wait in the street for more medics to arrive as the first crew sped off with Lynsey.He suffered a fractured skull and a five-inch blade wound above his right eye which needed  stitches.Doctors warned he would have lost his sight had the cleaver connected any lower.He also suffered cuts to his stomach and back in the frenzied attack and spent three days in hospital.Lynsey lost two pints of blood and was unconscious when she reached Glasgow’s Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. She spent days in a coma fighting for le.Scott, who lives with Lynsey in Greenock, was separated from her during her battle for le and was only allowed to see her the next day.She had emergency surgery and needed  staples to close her gaping throat.She has been left permanently disfigured with an eight-inch scar that runs under her chin to her right ear.Surgeons told her the blade just missed vital arteries which,severed, could have killed her in seconds.She said: “I don’t remember much between collapsing and waking up in intensive care.“My mum was allowed in to kiss me goodbye. She didn’t think I was going to make it.”Traumatised Lynsey now struggles to speak due to her injuries and wants to start a new le with Scott away from the town.She said: “I get stared at in the street. We don’t go out, I can’t leave the house after dark. Every time I see a young guy, I wonderhe was there.“If I hear a noise coming from outside, I’m terried. I’m always looking over my shoulder.“I get nightmares — I keep thinking they’re going to come through the window.”Warnock, also of Greenock, was arrested after the midnight attack on June .He was convicted of assaulting Scott and trying to murder Lynsey after a trial last month.He will be sentenced at the High Court in Edinburgh on February . Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Iaposve fought against anti-Semitism - and I mean physically on the streets when I was younger - all my le. He added: We never handled the anti-Semitism issue correctly. We should have done things quicker, and you pay the consequences. But he also said some opponents of Jeremy Corbyn used it to undermine him as leader.  He told the BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show: Iaposm absolutely convinced that there were those iniduals who opposed Jeremy Corbynaposs election right from the beginning, used the anti-Semitism issue - which I think is quite despicable that they did this on such an important subject - to undermine Corbyn, thereaposs no doubt about that. He said it was not about minimising the scale of the problem - but that the Jewish Labour Movement had said the majority of its members would not want Mr Corbyn as leader. He added: The issue was not well handled. It provided ammunition for Corbynaposs enemies, who used it. Lots of people were genuinely concerned, I have no problem with that. But there were others who were disingenuous. All four Labour leadership candidates have backed a list of  demands from the Board of Deputies of British Jews. They include making an independent provider responsible for complaints, engaging more with main representative groups and not fringe bodies, and banning those expelled over anti-Semitism for le. But deputy leadership candidates Richard Burgon and Dawn Butler have refused to back the pledges, saying they could marginalise some Jewish groups and change should not be rushed. Mr McCluskey said it was utter nonsense to call for them to be kicked out of the race. He told Sky News: Both Dawn and Richard have made it clear that they believe thereaposs a need for more debate and discussion about a couple of the points that are in the Board of Deputies pledges. Most of them are fine but a couple of them need further consideration. Meanwhile Mr McCluskey claimed Labouraposs election defeat last month was virtually, solely down to Brexit and defended the partyaposs policies on other matters. He told Sky Newsaposs Sophy Ridge On Sunday: Two years ago Jeremy Corbyn was loved. What happened in the last two years  Brexit, and Labouraposs inability to effectively stay with their  manesto position of respecting the  referendum and arguing to take Labour and the country out of Europe on a deal that protects jobs and investment.  That got lost in the two years and that affected how people perceived Jeremy as a leader and we paid the consequences for that. He added: I’d have preferred the election back in the summer for sure because Labour was slipping more and more into being perceived as a Remain party and I knew that was dangerous in our heartlands.” And he said it was unfair to refer to Rebecca Long-Bailey as continuity Corbyn.

It will become the second of the national networks  rail passenger franchises to be nationalised under the Government-owned “operator of last resort” which is owned outright by the taxpayer. South Western Railway, which is owned by First Group and Hong Kong firm MTR, has also been described by Mr Shapps as “unsustainable” after making a loss of £ million last year, and is also on the verge of renationalisation. It now faces going bust without Government intervention. Northern Rail - which runs from Newcastle to Leeds, Liverpool, Hull, Manchester and Stoke - barely manages to run half its trains on time. The line is run by Arriva and owned by German state-owned DeutchesBahn and has been involved in a long-running dispute over the role of guards. Its long-term future, and that of the UK network is currently under Government review.

I’d finished university, and was working  to  for next to nothing, so I’d taken a bar job in Brighton at the weekends for extra money. It was about midday on a Saturday when I opened the door to the back room of the bar and got the shock of my le. There was a guy in there, completely starkers. What the hell ! ‘Oh, that’s Henry,’ said my boss, when I collared him to ask why on earth there was a strange naked bloke hiding out the back. ‘He’s doing our new le drawing classes for hen parties. He just takes off his clothes and the girls draw him.’ I thought for a minute. ‘How much is he getting paid ’ My boss shrugged. ‘A hundred quid, cash in hand.’ Woah! I could really do with money like that.  Before I knew it, the words were out of my mouth: ‘Well, I’d do it for £.’ If I knew one thing about my boss, it was that he loved a bargain. ‘Deal,’ he said. And that was that. No training, no nothing, just pencils and paper thrust in my hand, and the words: ‘Just command the room, right ’ Er, OK… Dutch courage My first job was utterly terrying. Whatit was a total disaster  Whatthe girls just laughed  Oh God... ‘There’s no way I can do this sober,’ I thought, knocking back a few drinks first to try to calm my nerves. I was still incredibly embarrassed when it was time to undo my pinny and stand there stark naked in front of  girls. ‘It’s my first job, go easy on me,’ I said, desperately hoping that might lower everyone’s expectations.  I poured the girls extra-strong shots, handed out pencils and paper and got into what I hoped was a flattering position. ‘Right, girls, let’s draw!’ And they did. It sounds strange, but within five minutes I didn’t feel like I was naked, I was just having a chat. Ninety minutes later I was £ richer and hugely relieved. The girls seemed to have had a fun time, and now it was all over I decided I’d rather enjoyed it too. The more jobs I did, the easier it became, although there was always that slight fear of the unknown. A couple of ex girlfriends were getting married at the time and I couldn’t stop thinking, ‘Whatit’s their hen party ’ Luckily that didn’t happen, but my worst-ever job was walking out to see someone I knew from university. I could have died as she sat there staring at my naked body, clearly wondering what I was doing with my degree. Most hen parties were pretty classy. Very occasionally I’d get a room of drunken women who’d just draw a stick man with a penis, but most really got into the class. A light bulb moment The bookings grew and grew until I was doing up to four jobs a day at weekends. It struck me there could be a whole business in this – like Butlers In The Buff, but for le drawing. The name came to me first: Nude Le. I bought the website domain for £, then started looking for le models. The first one I signed up was actually Henry from the pub! That was , and now we have over  guys on our books, as well as a few girls.  We do everything from corporate events to team building and birthdays, but hen parties are still our bread and butter. It’s a simple format. The hens choose three poses and the last one involves the bride too. That final pose can get a bit cheekythe hens suggest doing a sex position, and we’ve even had a couple of brides strip off too! But it’s always just fun, never seedy. The number one question I’m asked by male models is: what happensI get an erection  It does happen occasionally!

Thousands of troops are on standby to prop up essential services and emergency medical carethe killer coronavirus reaches the UK. On Saturday the death toll hit  in China and several more countries confirmed cases of the disease. These include three in France, which means the virus has travelled nearly , miles from the city of Wuhan, to just across the Channel. So far tests on  Brits sus-pected of having snake flu – which has an incubation period of up to  days – have come back negative. But experts fear its arrival here is inevitable. Health chiefs, airlines and border force agents are desperately trying to trace , people who recently travelled between Wuhan and Britain. And GPs have been told anyone they even suspect of having the virus must immediately be placed in isolation. A senior defence source said: “At the moment we are playing a waiting game. “The medical advice is the virus will arrive in the UK soon. But its impact is the big unknown. “We have to plan for the worst case scenario – that is the virus spreads across the UK and infects a large proportion of the population. “If that happens troops will be deployed to carry out vital roles, like the transportation of food and fuel. They may also operate fire engines and drive ambulances. “These are all things troops have done in the past. They could also be used to deal with any civil unrest.”  Under MoD plans, the decision to deploy the Army will be taken at the “highest level”. They also require medical personnel specialising in environmental health and infectious diseases to be put on high alert. In China more than , cases of snake flu have been confirmed, but that number is expected to skyrocket. President Xi Jinping yesterday confirmed the spread of the disease is speeding up. He said: “Faced with the grave situation of an accelerating spread of the new coronavirus...it is necessary to strengthen the centralised and unied leadership.”  As he spoke, builders were rushing to complete a ,-patient hospital, dedicated to treating the coronavirus. It is due to open in Wuhan – home to million – in just five days. Tragically the disease has also claimed the le of at least one doctor. Liang Wudong, , died of exhaustion on Friday. A second medic, Jiang Jijun, has also reportedly died from a heart attack, also caused by exhaustion. Videos filmed in Chinese hospitals show other medics collaps-ing and patients lying on the floor in overcrowded corridors. Outside the hospitals, streets are deserted as million citizens have been warned to stay at home. The lockdown comes just as millions of families gather to celebrate the Chinese New Year. Snake flu, also known as the Wuhan virus, or more officially as -nCoV, can cause severe pneumonia.

We went on a sunset cruise, which was unreal, he enjoyed it so much. We were so much in love but we always knew our time was limited together and this is why we knew we had to pack a lot in,Michelle said. Michelle, , from Gateshead met Adam, , in  when she worked in Dorothy Perkins and he worked in the Burtons shop below. The pair initially took things slow because of Michelleaposs three-year-old daughter Ruby but she eventually realised he was the one and they moved in together in . She said: “I can’t tell you how besotted I am with him, I’m obsessed with him and so was Ruby, she absolutely adored him. He was my soulmate and I have to spend the next  years without him.

He received radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment. But by December  Adam had another seizure and the tumour continued to grow. The following year he had brain surgery and was put on a dferent type of chemo. The couple did not let the news top them from achieving their goals and in  they bought a house together. Michelle and Adam got married in June last year knowing that there time was limited. “Adam took everything in his stride, he was the most laid back bloke, he always said ‘it is what it is’,” added Michelle. But whilst they were on their honeymoon Adam started to get focal seizures and on hismedics increased his medication. His health deteriorated and on his th birthday he was admitted to Marie Curie Hospice in Newcastle where he stayed until he died. The family decided to celebrate Christmas early on December  knowing Adam did not have much time left. Michelle said: “Ruby loved the day.

Ruby opened some presents in front of Adam and we put a little Christmas tree up in his room. Adam died peacefully on December . He just fell asleep and went quietly, added Michelle. They took his medication lines off and I thought ‘thank God he is at peace’. You could see it in his face that he was at peace now. He had fought for almost four years and his fight was finally over.

The -year-old wants everyone to see this heartrending picture of herself in a -day coma with multiple fractures to her face, arms, ribs and spine – as she today calls on the Government to ban drivers from drinking at all. Fraya’s world was torn apart by serial drink-drive offender Adam White last January. He was twice the legal limit when his van ploughed head-on into her mum Kate’s car at mph as he overtook a truck on a single carriageway. Kate’s Peugeot was catapulted into the air and landed upside down, killing her and leaving passengers Fraya and her little brother Zackeri, then eight, in intensive care. And even as the two heartbroken children battled back from their le-changing injuries while coping with grief over the loss of their mum, White, , was again stopped for drink-driving. It was only following his conviction for that incident – five months after the fatal crash – that police charged him over -year-old Kate’s death. Now he is serving just nine years in jail – and could be out in half that time while the Cunningham family face a le sentence of grief.Fraya says: “I want the world to know what a drink-driver has done to me, what kind of damage drink-drivers cause. No one should drink and drive.” Her dad Kris, , adds: “If pictures of Fraya’s injuries save just two people then that’s a positive.I was told she had a  per cent chance of survival. To see your daughter lying there with more parts of her body broken than fixed is something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. “Her stomach was left open for eight days, her arteries had ripped.” He says his family will never get over Kate’s loss. “White has destroyed everybody who knew Kate. She was the most loving person, and the best mother. She deserved more than that.  “The laws must change to no alcohol for drivers. Alcohol affects everybody dferently.” The . per cent maximum blood alcohol content allowed in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is one of the most lax limits in the world and the highest in Europe. Russia, Romania and Pakistan all ban motorists consuming any alcohol. In  – the latest figures available – deaths due to drink-driving here hit an eight-year high, reaching up to  – the highest since . It was a miracle both Fraya and Zackeri survived the crash near Crowland, Lincs, in January last year. Kris, of Peterborough, was toldthe car had rolled just a little further Zackeri’s neck would have been snapped and Fraya would have been crushed to death.  Zackeri was left with a fractured neck and Fraya was put in an induced coma because of internal bleeding and a suspected brain bleed. Kris was told she suffered heart failure and had ‘died’ several times in the ambulance before reaching intensive care. “The first thought in my mind was how am I going to tell my little boy that not only his mother’s dead, but his sister’s dead,” he says. He took photos of his little girl to prepare visiting relatives for the shock of seeing her injuries. “We were taking it hour by hour, as we thought we would lose her,” he says. “You can’t describe what it feels like to look at your daughter there, with plasters on her eyes to stop them drying up. “There was nothing there. They had to drill into her head to release pressure on her brain.” When Zackeri came out of intensive care, he wanted to see his sister. He was shocked. “Until Fraya started showing signs of coming out of her coma, Zackeri hardly said a word at all,” Kris says.  “He’s suffered a lot with guilt, seeing his sister with all these broken bones and plaster casts.” She was in Peterborough City Hospital hospital for eight weeks and needed a wheelchair for many months after her discharge. She will be scarred for le. Zackeri was in a brace for six weeks and can’t play any sport. Meanwhile dad-of-six White of Spalding, Lincs, had been taken to hospital with leg injuries after the crash. At first he told police he had no memory of the accident but that he was doing Dry January so he couldn’t have been drunk. Then he later said he’d drunk a pint of cider before the crash. White had already forced a car to veer off the road before he hit Kate’s car, causing injuries to the driver. In June he was stopped by police for drink-driving and convicted of the offence in November. It wasn’t until December that he was charged in connection with Kate’s death. “Ultimately this delay could have cost another le,” says a furious Kris.  “I think everybody is very, very lucky that it didn’t.” Last week White admitted to causing death by dangerous driving and three counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving at Peterborough Crown Court. His string of previous convictions between  and  included four drink-driving charges and three of driving while disqualied and uninsured. The serial offender had also previously admitted failing to stop at an accident, failing to provide a specimen and aggravated vehicle taking. Judge Matthew Lowe told the court he would have sentenced White to  years had he denied the charges, but his guilty plea meant it had to be knocked down to nine years. The maximum jail term for causing death by dangerous driving is  years. White was also given a -year driving ban to begin after his release and he will have to take a driving test before being allowed back on the road.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailAn aposeccentricapos man used his love for ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome as inspiration as he transformed his dingy flat into an extraordinary - yet his family had absolutely no idea about his incredible art project. When Ron Gittins passed away in September , it was the first time his elder sister, Pat Williams, had stepped inside the rented ground floor property in years.From the outside, Ronaposs home looks much the same as any of the other double-fronted Victorian terraces in Oxton Village, reports the Liverpool Echo.Apart from the pile of rubbish in the front yard and the dirty white blinds covering the windows, you wouldnapost even look twice as you passed by. But push open the front door, and inside was something no-one, particularly not Pat, could have ever imagined. The majority of the propertyaposs walls and ceilings are decorated with vivid murals, Egyptian hieroglyphics, underwater scenes and portraits of historic leaders. Andthis werenapost unusual enough, in one front room a m-tall fireplace in the shape of a lionaposs head seems to roar as you enter. And across the hall, a fierce bull-shaped fireplace scowls at the stack of rubbish piled high in the bay window. Pat, who is a former Wirral Mayor and was a Liberal Democrat councillor until she retired from politics at the age of , said: When we first went inside after he died I had the shock of my le because it was absolutely full of all sorts of stuff. How he coped in there I just donapost know. I donapost appreciate all his art but what heaposs done is incredible. The fireplaces are extraordinary. A boy soprano who later became a brilliant Buddy Holly impersonator, Ron showed promise as an artist from an early age and studied at the Laird School of Art in Birkenhead. He was a powerful orator and could quote scenes from Shakespeare in a manner that would, Pat says, give Richard Burton or Laurence Olivier a run for their money. And although he was involved in ious local acting groups, she says he didnapost like to take direction. Pat, , says: As a child he was hyperactive and very creative. When he was a boy he used to make little soldiers out of plasticine that were from all types of regiments and countries. The details in the unorms were incredible. He used to get into trouble in school for attention seeking and being what was thought to be mischevious and a little bit naughty but I think he was just bored a lot of the time. Today he would be diagnosed on the autism spectrum, Iaposm sure of it, and be treated with much more acceptance. Pat says Ron, who died a month shy of his th birthday, always displayed unusual behaviour but became more eccentric in his later years, turning up to Pataposs th birthday in a thick coat, wellies, a wig and a hat in case his head got cold.  A familiar sight in his local village, Ron would often be seen walking the streets dressed in a series of homemade military costumes and pushing an old-fashioned pram which he would fill with bags of cement used to build his gigantic fireplaces. From time to time, he was even known to take his le-sized papier mache model of Egyptian queen Cleopatra out for a stroll. After his death, a local family who were fond of her brother told Pat they used to shout Ron alertthey spotted him through the window before rushing to see what costume he was wearing. Instead of flowers on his coffin, his sister placed two of his hats and a wig in a gesture she thought he would have enjoyed. Pat and Ron stayed in touch until his death, though their relationship was sometimes strained, partially due to his own unfulfilled political ambition.  She says: He resented the fact that I was the eldest and a woman. He had this view that men are really the ones that should be in charge. But he was a very big supporter of Margaret Thatcher. However, the last time they met, Ron visited Pat at home with a big bunch of flowers for her birthday - a few months late - and they had a good chat. Pat says: I was sad that he died on his own but he didnapost want everybody to know he wasnapost well and he didnapost want to go to hospital. He lived le on his own terms. His flat is certainly proof of that - and it is now being saved by his niece Jan Williams, Pataposs daughter, who is herself an artist.  At the end of his le, he cooked on a camping stove and is thought to have slept in a sleeping bag in the hall. He had water and electricity but no gas - and consequently no central heating - because he wouldnapost allow his landlord inside to make repairs in case he ended up having to leave his home. Ron rarely invited visitors inside and Jan knows of only a few people who had been admitted in years before his death. She believes this is partly because he was house-proud and didnapost want friends or family to see how dilapidated his flat had become. But art consultant Angela Samata says Ronaposs work is a fascinating example of aposOutsider Artapos - a term used to describe work created outside the mainstream art world.  She says: Itaposs so important to keep this because itaposs not very often that we uncover these Outside Art environments that are created by an inidual like Ron for their own pleasure. Heaposs almost created this fantasy world. Itaposs wonderful to hear that so few people have stepped across the threshold. Through Ronaposs eyes, the piles of what most of us would consider to be fit only for a skip were a treasure trove of art materials. He kept things, not for the sake of it, but because he could find a use for them in his creations. Among the mountain of rubbish in the living room during our visit there are the skeleton of a pram, an Argos catalogue, the side of a ceramic bath, an empty two-litre pop bottle and a tiny pencil sketch of a mounted soldier. In the back room, beneath murals of Napoleon, Lord Nelson and Lady Hamilton, the array of objects includes a Singer sewing machine, a photo of the Queen on horseback, an Airfix model kit of the German battleship Bismarck and a bag of marbles.  In the bathroom cabinet - a packet of tooth powder and a box of lawn feed. In the other front room - a collection of homemade breast plates, a wardrobe full of military jackets and other costumes, and an almost pristine phone book from June . Jan and her partner, Chris Teasdale, are now picking through what remains in the flat to work out what is valuable. Their goal is to preserve Ronaposs flat and turn it into a cultural asset for the community to share. Among their most intriguing finds are loose pages of lined A paper containing Ronaposs observations during trips to London - evidence of his claim that he worked for the Secret Service. One page, entitled Trip to London  Nov reads: . Paving stones, uneven at Russell Sq, . Passed Home Office, [...] . Charing Cross toilet, no need to pay.  Pat says: Ron told everyone he was working for the Secret Service. Even the minister at his funeral knew all about it. Keen to preserve her uncleaposs home for artists and other people to enjoy in the future, Jan has managed to secure a lease with the buildingaposs owners, social landlord Salisbury Management Services. Through theirapos artist collaboration The Caravan Gallery, she and Chris have launched a crowdfunder - Saving Ronaposs Place - to protect his legacy as an extraordinary example of Outsider Art. They would also like to restore its former entrance, which Ron had flanked with Egyptian statues that he had eventually had to remove for safety reasons.

Furious native Americans say the £million mansion on Vancouver Island, where the couple are staying with son Archie, is on territory once robbed by the Brits. And they want it back. Chief of the local Tseycum tribe Tanya Jimmy urged the royal couple: “Don’t ignore us. The land the house is built on is stolen. She explained to the Sunday Mirror: “It was taken from us in treaties signed in the s. Our people back then didn’t realise what they were doing. “Land was taken for a few hundred dollars and our people would sign the treaty with an ‘X’ as they couldn’t read or write.” Britain colonised Vancouver Island after Captain Cook arrived there in . The first British settlement came in . Speaking about Harry and Meghan’s hideaway, Tanya said: “There will be ancestors buried there. We get no money from the land now, nothing “But for us it’s just not right houses like that are built there.” Harry flew out to be reunited with Meghan and Archie this week after the Queen refused to allow his proposals for the couple to become financially independent part-time royals.The prince made it clear he was not happy with the outcome and is believed to be planning the couple’s future at the property owned by a mystery pal. While their mansion has five bedrooms and eight bathrooms, living conditions among their Tseycum neighbours can be a lot more cramped. Tanya, , said: “I know one home where four generations live under one roof, several people in three bedrooms.”  She added: “Our bus service starts at am and ends at pm so people set their lives by that. It’s a world away from having drivers whenever you want.” Tanya said her community was hit hard by her country’s historical “residential school system”. She said: “It split families, took young people away from communities and destroyed them to make them ‘Western’.” As a result she said her people struggle with issues close to the royal couple’s hearts. She added: “Meghan would appreciate that women here are the ones holding our community together. We really are the glue.

According to a former confidante of the -year-old yoga teacher, Doria silently influenced the shocking choice by Meghan and Prince Harry. In a deal which will see them spend a majority of their time in Canada with son Archie, they will not use their HRH titles, will no longer formally represent the Queen and will not receive public funds for royal duties. In addition they will repay £.million used to do refurbish  Frogmore Cottage – the Windsor home they will continue to use when in the UK. The confidante told Mail Online that Doria had grown close to Harry who described her as amazing shortly after the couple got engaged. They said they believe she has most definitely been giving the couple advice during the current drama. They said: When Meghan and Harry announced they were walking away from their jobs as Royals to be financially independent, it immediately smacked of Doria. Being financially independent has always been important to her. Harry in particular turns to herfor advice. She is like the Queen – she never complains and never explains.  Doria has a great warmth. Sheaposs a brilliant cook and is very motherly, but she isnapost someone who seeks attention, and for Harry her discretion and silence mean the world. Meghan has always trusted her completely but she has become a rock to Harry who, of course, lost his own mother so young. Sheaposs laid-back, and people see her nose ring and dreadlocks which are cool – but make no mistake, she has a core of steel. Underestimate her at your peril. Doria, who lives in Los Angeles,  has kept a dignied silence about her daughter while Meghanaposs estranged dad Thomas Markle has openly spoken about his relationship with her.  In addition his daughter Samantha Markle has been highly critical of her half-sibling even before Meghan fell out with her dad. Doria has always been someone who values her privacy and no more so than now, the confidante said. But she has been back and forth for the last few weeks. And when sheaposs not with them, she is on the phone constantly. On Saturday Thomas said his final wish is to be reunited with Meghan – and he will never give up trying.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA British pensioner aged  is planning to wed her -year-old Egyptian toyboy – even though she’s  years older than his mummy. Iris Jones fell for Mohamed Ahmed Irbriham on Facebook and fell into his arms the first time they met. Within hours, four sexless decades were swept away on a tide of passion. After four days they tried to wed in Cairo but didn’t have the right paperwork. Now Iris is saving up to– despite opposition from her family. Feisty Iris insists Mohamed isn’t after her money nor is he seeking a passport to Britain. She says: “If he’s marrying me for my fortune he’ll be sadly disappointed because I live on a pension. “I don’t suffer fools gladly. I’m honest and I’m truthful and I told him straight away he couldn’t be a freeloader.“In Egypt we were quite frivolous, going out to the best restaurants all the time and we split everything  . “He’s even said he’ll sign a pre-nup because it’s me he wants – not my house. “I’ve spent years making other people happy, now I just want to marry the man I love before I die. I’ve always been a bit of a rebel and he’s just perfect for me.” Iris, of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, tells how Mohamed greeted her when they first met at Cairo airport last November. “I was shocked by how tall he is,” she says. “He’s ft in and I’m a foot smaller but he just gave me a huge hug.”  Hours later, they became intimate and Iris adds: “It was incredible. I felt like a virgin again. It wasn’t easy but it was very loving and romantic. My ex-husband said I was frigid when we orced  years ago but I now know I’m certainly not.” She admits their first encounter came in a sleazy run-down area of Cairo – because, Iris says, respectable hotels would have frowned on their age gap. Iris lives on £-a-week pension and disability benefit. A former cleaner, she has a £, bungalow. Mohamed, meanwhile, has little savings after quitting his job when his boss refused to give him time off for Iris’s visit. But the Romeo, from Giza, insists he is not interested in Iris for material gain.  He says: “This is not about money. Money is not everything. It cannot buy you happiness. Love has no age and knows no limits. Iris and I found we understood each other well and felt the tenderness. I do not care about anyone’s opinion – only what feels good to me. “Iris is wonderful, understanding and compassionate. We share the same views about lots of things. I’m not interested in Iris’s money. I work as a quality inspector in the field of welding materials and travelled to many countries. “It is not right people look at everything through materialism. If they do, they have no feelings.”  Iris defends Mohamed, saying: “We are absolutely equal in every way. He’s not using me. If anything I’m using him because my love for him is selfish – I’m not going to let him go.” The romance has caused upset with Iris’s sons. While newlywed Steve, , has reluctantly accepted the relationship, Darren, , hasn’t. Iris says: “Steve heard Mohamed and I on the phone. He could see how well we got on, how happy he makes me. He’s a bit wary but I’m sure, given time, he will accept Mohamed as a father. “But Darren is worried Mohamed is just after my money and we had a big row which resulted in me asking him to leave the house. We have made up since, but I’ve asked him not to talk about it – I don’t want to argue.  “Mohamed’s never asked for money. I don’t have any. I’ve done a lot for my boys over the years and I want them to understand that it’s time for me to be selfish now and look after myself.” The unlikely couple “met” last summer through a Facebook page exploring atheist views. They began messaging each other and, two weeks later, Mohamed proclaimed his love and jokingly referred to her as “we”. Iris says: “I asked him, ‘What do you want an old biddy like me for  You’ve not met me, you’ve never touched my skin or looked into my eyes’. “But he told me I was a wonderful charming lady who he loved to bits. Slowly, I started to feel the same and then he sent me a picture of himself and I thought, ‘Ooh, you’re gorgeous’. “We are both Virgos. I think that’s why we get on. We are soulmates. He’s a very intelligent man and was looking for an intelligent woman. I don’t look my age and I’m fit and healthy, but it’s definitely a case of brains over beauty.”  Their physical relationship hit problems in Cairo when she fell down some stairs and spent two nights in hospital – with, Iris says, “absolute gentleman” Mohamed by her side. They then spent five days in Cairo, visiting the pyramids and taking camel and boat rides. Iris met her prospective mother-in-law – aged  – and says: “She was marvellous and glad her son had found the woman he’d been looking for. She said age was just a number. We got on like a house on fire.” Iris and Mohamed went to the British Embassy to check whether they could marry in Cairo. But she didn’t have her orce papers and they also needed a certicate of no impediment to show there was no barrier to getting married. “When they said we couldn’t get married I howled,” Iris says. “We went to see a lawyer to find out what paperwork we need. The lt was broken but Mohamed is so wonderful he carried me up four flights of stairs.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rachael bletchley one 20 british","story":"NewsopinionI hope there is a special welcome in hell for evil Holocaust deniersAnti-semitism has become a global virus while Holocaust denial is spreading and poisoning minds, writes Rachael Bletchley, as she visits Nazi death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau on the th anniversary of its liberationShareCommentsByRachael Bletchly:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsopinionA doctor helps a group of survivors at the entrance to the newly-liberated Auschwitz concentration camp in January  \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

And I will be honoured to stand beside them as they make what could be their final pilgrimage. Because I’ve been privileged to meet and interview several Holocaust ­survivors over the years. And each of them has dedicated their lives to educating future generations about the horrors of Hitler’s “final solution”. Like Helga Weiss who, survived four death camps including Auschwitz. In , aged , she told me: “I am one of the lucky ones. Luck or fate, or a miracle meant I survived. “Now I get invited to visit schools to talk about myself. It’s not a pleasure.

One in three people know little or nothing about the mass ­extermination of more than six ­million Jews. Five per cent didn’t know what the term Holocaust referred to.  I recently met a woman of  whose Polish parents come from Krakow, just  miles from Auschwitz-Birkenau. She had never even heard of the place and just looked blank when I tried to explain gas chambers, furnaces and the systematic murder of . million ­innocent souls that happened there. But at least she hadn’t already learned it was “a hoax” from one of the liars, deniers or neo-Nazis infecting social media – now the greatest propaganda machine in history.Prince Charles, speaking in Israel this week, called the Holocaust’s lessons “searingly relevant to this day”. He added: “Hatred and ­intolerance still lurk in the human heart, still tell new lies, still adopt new disguises.” Like the far-right extremists who’ve begun visiting ­former concentration camps in order to disrupt guided tours, distort facts and film themselves causing trouble.

With January the peak time for ­orces, they are back on the market, dipping their toes, and swiping their thumbs, into the world of online dating. And whether we like it or not, ­traditional romance is dead. Back when online dating started, there was a stigma attached – you had to be pretty sad and lonely to not meet someone the “normal way”. But now it is the norm. One in five relationships starts online, and there are seven million Brits registered on dating sites. They’ve got their own language. Ghosting – when your beloved disappears and ignores your messages. And “benching”, when you are kept in someone’s circle of dates but won’t commit. And now there’s “negging”, the practice of making slightly insulting comments to someone you find attractive in order to make them take an interest in you. A friend of mine, who’s in her s, is suddenly having to ­navigate this scary new place. She split from her long-term partner over Christmas and was used to being wooed the old-fashioned, face-to-face way. Not seeing pictures of their privates before pecking them on the cheek. She admits she hasn’t got a clue about what to say, do or ask. She’s never had to swipe in any direction, stress over the perfect profile picture or try to boil her personality and le down to a sentence. She has chatted to some men, and met up with one, who sounded fantastic on their WhatsApp chats. But when she plucked up the courage to meet him for a drink , she discovered he was a bit dull. I told her it’s a numbers game and to get straight back into it. Next!

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA mum renovated a derelict Victorian villa completely hidden by overgrown trees into an amazing family home - and the transformation is unbelievable. Caroline Quinn, , and husband Mark, , decided to take on the challenge of completely renovating the neglected house and barn in a village near Carlisle, Cumbria, after buying it in September  it was on the market at £, due to its state of disrepair. After the family grew out of their old home in the same village when Caroline and Mark had their third child, the mum-of-three wanted to personalise a new home to her familyaposs needs with a large open plan kitchen and upstairs laundry room. But despite an estate agent being aposwaryapos to show her the dilapidated building after scrambling through overgrown plants just to get to the front door, Caroline has now revealed her homeaposs stunning makeover, which took one year to complete. The full-time property developer said: When we were shown around the property, the estate agent opened the door a bit wary, but as soon as I stepped in and saw the spacious hallway, I knew it was our next home. It was derelict and had none of the mod-cons but had lots of original features and an old barn which was once used to keep horses. When we bought the house, we couldnapost even see it from the roadside because all the trees around it were overgrown - we had to scramble to the front door just to get in. People suggested we build a new house instead, but we wanted to keep the Victorian character then add our own personal touches. The state of it didnapost put us off - it had no plumbing or central heating, so it was a blank canvas. Being a period property with all the original features left in a good condition it was so important for us to keep it that way, so we kept the front of the house more traditional. We also had a tick list of what we wanted to put in the house, which included an open plan kitchen, a study on the ground floor, and a big family bathroom - it was really important for the rooms to be practical.  With a huge passion for interior design, Caroline and Mark put their own colourful touch in many of the rooms, the standout features being a pink door in the hallway and their neon yellow laundry room. The five-bedroomed home boasts its traditional Victorian features at the front, with the original door and brickwork, but now has a contemporary twist with a modern extension at the back and quirky cinema room and gym converted from the old barn. The couple started to work on the house straight away and the first they did was clear the outside of the overgrown shrubbery and trees, which once hid the beautul home out of sight. They decided to build the modern extension at the back of the original home, then connected it to the characterful old barn, now a luxury family cinema room, with a glazed walkway.  Caroline took to Pinterest and Instagram for decorating inspiration, but more often followed her own taste and added several bright pops of coloured paint to dferent rooms and statement furniture. The savvy saver shopped around for designer furniture on eBay to bag the best deals - managing to pick up a brand new William Holland bathtub that retailed at £, for less than £,. She said: Usually when weaposre renovating houses, we have to do it quite neutral for customers, so in every room weaposve tried to put a bit of colour in. I decided to paint part of the laundry room bright yellow - Mark said aposwhat are you on aboutapos when I first suggested it but I think itaposs just a bit of fun. The vestibule door is painted pink and it is the original house door - I would have painted the front door pinkI could have!

Cat Hughes, , has told how the aposflirtyapos messages from principal Toby Belfield, , ruined her le and gave her nightmares. Her plight led to safeguarding investigations at Ruthin School, a £,-a-year boarding school in North Wales. Cat, from Ruthin, has spoken publicly to North Wales Live about how the married teacher struck up a conversation with her in . He then bombarded her with messages for nine months - even sending them in the early hours of the morning. He told her she was cute and that she looked good in her blazer and said that flirting is fine. Mr Belfield also talked about breasts, virginity and sexuality and said he liked women small and petite. And he commented on how in more than % of schools the Principal would be sacked for sending chat messages to a pupil. Cat said the tone of the messages became more flirtatious after she reached her th birthday, but admitted they became so frequent they had a serious impact on her mental health. After screenshots of the messages came to light, an investigation was launched involving North Wales Police and Denbighshire Council. A number of recommendations were made but no criminal investigation was instigated. Mr Belfield had previously been dubbed Britainaposs strictest headteacher after he hit the headlines for threatening them with expulsionthey formed romantic relationships while attending the school.  He later backtracked on the policy that saw him warning pupils he would give them a worse reference for universitythey got a boyfriend or girlfriend while attending Ruthin. Meanwhile, another ex-pupil also came forward this week to share messages in which Mr Belfield tells her she is special, naughty and looks stunning in a dress. Regulators from Estyn and the Care Inspectorate Wales carried out unannounced inspections in the wake of the scandal and a damning CIW report revealed major safeguarding concerns at the school. Cat moved to Ruthin School from another high school in Year  when she was awarded a bursary after doing a scholarship exam. She said she hated it at first but started spending more time in school due to family problems and it was when she was in Year  that the messages from Mr Belfield started.  Speaking from her home, she said: At first, I thought it was fine. I heard he messaged other girls and I thought, this is quite nice, he likes me, heaposs taking an interest. At the start it was mainly holidays and family and plans for the future. But when I was struggling with personal issues, he carried on messaging me throughout the summer term, which was really nice for me. I felt valued. It felt like a privilege because it meant he liked me and I felt important and like I did matter.  But as the messages went on, there were some topics where I thought maybe he shouldnapost be saying that, but at the same time, you just think thataposs what heaposs like and give him the benefit of the doubt. She felt like she had to reply because she was worried she would lose her place at the prestigious schoolshe didnapost. When she started struggling more with personal issues, she said she was elated when Mr Belfield offered her weekly boarding in November . But shortly afterwards, she was admitted to hospital. The messages continued but this time, they were more personal.  Cat said: One said it would break his heartanything happened to me, that he did care about me and that I was special. At the time I just thought maybe he is a bit more invested in me than other students, which was a bit weird but at the same time, I didnapost have that from any one . When I went home during the holidays, I was getting more messages at am, am and because I needed my place, I felt like I had to reply. He used to tell me how he also messaged other girls at the school and even sent me some pictures of himself with them. Cat added: I got a message at .am on New Yearaposs Day and I remember thinking, bloody hell, you thought of me straight away, even my friends and my family donapost message me that quickly.  This is weird, Iaposm . Cat said she noticed the messages seemed to slow down while Mr Belfield was travelling but would start up again once he was in his hotel room, telling her what the countries he was in were like and how he felt being away from home and his we. It was always Mr Belfield who instigated conversations, she said. But while he was away, Cat admitted she felt more relaxed around school and that she could be herself more. As her mental health deteriorated, she felt his attitude towards her changed and she deactivated her Instagram to escape the relentless messages.  She said: I couldnapost handle talking to him and I didnapost want to block him because heaposd take it personally and I couldnapost risk that because I still needed my place. If I deactivated it, I could play it off as needing to revise but he sent someone to tell me he needed to be able to contact me and asked for my number. I didnapost want him having it so I reactivated my account. She added: The messages kept coming. A lot of it was about me being pretty in my blazer. Two days after my th birthday, the messages started getting more flirty. He started conversations about relationships and boyfriends saying things like aposshould I be jealousapos and how I would aposmake a terrible girlfriendapos.  He started using more emojis and love hearts. There was only a few occasions when I thought, no, thataposs wrong - one was when he was talking about one of my friends getting a place at Ruthin School because she was pretty. I remember thinking, you shouldnapost be saying that. He also asked meI had an eating disorder because I was skinny and I looked good. I did show the messages to people in school but I felt like people were too scared to do anything about it. I read back on them a lot now and I think how could you not see  Talking about Rachel Rileyaposs disproportionate breasts and all the other stuff.  Yes, it made me feel uncomfortable but I didnapost think anything was wrong with it at the time. I just thought it must be okay. Cat said she ended up having a break down and thataposs when a multi-disciplinary meeting was held. Mr Belfield gave her his personal mobile number in a message but she left the school shortly afterwards completing her GCSEs from a mental health unit and gaining an A and three Cs. She said: The control he had over me was just wrong.

Sources close to the Royal Family say Prince Charles and Prince William have been reaching out to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to say they couldto the UK full-time,they wanted to, without having to resume their official royal duties. Courtiers fear the pressure on Vancouver Island, where the Sussexes are staying, will have a major impact on the couple, The Sunday Times reports. “The palace are very worried about the Sussexes, because they are vulnerable outside the embrace of the family,” a source said. “They are making contingency plans in case the Sussexes suddenly turn round and say: ‘Can we come back under your wing ’”The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have issued a warning over harassment by photographers, who, they say, are permanently camped outside their Vancouver Island home. They said there have been attempts to photograph the Sussexes inside their home using long range lenses. Meghan was photographed while out walking with the coupleaposs infant son, Archie, and her two dogs. Lawyers for the couple claim the photos were taken without her consent and that the photographer was hiding in the bushes and spying on her. This comes after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex decided to step back from their senior roles within the Royal Family. Under the terms of the deal agreed by Harry and Meghan, the Sussexes will keep Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor estate as their British home, but will repay the £.m used to renovate the property.  Royal officials believe that might be a place to protect the couple from media scrutiny. “You could bring them back to Frogmore to look after them. They wouldn’tto royal duties, but they could have a period of rehabilitation and recuperation,” a source said. Other locations where the couple could be brought are Sandringham and the Prince of Walesaposs house in Wales “This is a looking ahead thing. There’s no timeline here. But everybody agrees that this is a fragile couple. Nobody is going to say, no they can’t come back, the source added.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA rugby player student has told how he battered serial rapist Reynhard Sinaga and feared he had killed him. The drugged teen said he woke from a stupor to find the monster on top of him. The victim – just  at the time – had been plied with a date rape drug and was half naked. Instinct kicked in and the man, who we are calling Peter to protect his identity, laid into Sinaga – pummelling him “like a cage fighter”. Peter, a strapping ft, gave Sinaga such a beating that he feared he was dead.He said: “I thought I might have killed him, I didn’t really know what I was doing, I was using my instincts and adrenaline to survive.” The pair traded blows in two brutal exchanges before Peter escaped. Peter, supported by his mother, told the Sunday Mirror how:He was initially arrested on suspicion of GBH against Sinaga. Police did not treat him as a rape victim to begin with and didn’t carry out tests on him for  hours. He feels like an “accidental hero” after ending Sinaga’s reign of depravity. Sinaga’s crimes may not have been detected had he not accidentally left his mobile in Peter’s pocket.The rapist had spiked Peter’s drinks with GHB before abusing him in the Manchester flat where scores of other men had already fallen victim. Sinaga, , videoed the assault. Police found hundreds of similar clips on his phone and he was this month convicted of  rapes against  men aged  to .  Reliving his ordeal, Peter said: “I woke up disorientated, face down on a pillow, there was a quilt on the floor. “My pants and jeans were down to the top of my knees, he was on top of me with his pants down to his ankles. “As I turned my head he jumped up and ran out of the bedroom. I pulled my pants up, did my belt up, I was still confused. I had no clue where I was. “A couple of minutes afterwards, he came back in fully dressed. “I said, ‘Mate, what’s happened ’ He started shouting, ‘Intruder! Intruder!’ I said, ‘Mate, calm down’, then he headbutts me on my nose and starts biting me. “I was so confused. We were grappling. He pulled me over on to the bed and bit my shoulder.He was a scrawny little guy. I was defending myself. I was stronger, I hit him a few times and he dropped to the floor. “I had his white phone in my pocket. I’ve no idea how it got there. My phone, driving licence and wallet were in the bathroom. I picked them up, still disorientated. “I was feeling scared, I knew I was in Manchester but that was about it.”  Peter said that as he tried to leave Sinaga jumped on his back. He went on: “I managed to get him off me, I started hitting him. I was over him like you see in UFC. It was like a big blur.When I stopped there was a lot of blood on him and me. He was on the floor not moving. I’d had scuffles playing rugby, but nothing like that.” Once free, Peter called his mum to pick him up. Then a neighbour of Sinaga gave him shelter.Peter said: “I called  and said, ‘I think I’ve been raped’. Then I thought he could be dead because of the amount of force I used.” Police told Peter’s mum to take him to Longsight station. En route, Peter told her: “Mum, I think I’ve killed him.” By the time they reached the station police were at Sinaga’s flat. A second nightmare was about to unfold – as Peter was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm.  Peter, who had been out celebrating his A-level results that night, explained: “Over the radio I heard them say they’d found him, then they said, ‘He’s not looking good’. “I didn’t feel worried because I’d done nothing wrong. They took my clothes and bagged them. They took pictures of the bite marks on my belly and back and my nose and knuckles. “They took my fingerprints and DNA. They questioned me like an offender, not a victim. He was in hospital and they told me they would question him when he was released. “I repeatedly said, ‘I think he’s tried to rape me’ but they didn’t do any tests. That’s the one thing I thought wasn’t right at the time.  “They askedI was straight or gay, I said I was straight. They asked had I used Grindr  Was it a date  “Had something gone wrong  I felt like they didn’t act on my complaint straight away.” Peter was held until pm before being released on bail. He added: “I thought they should have checked both sides. It was more like they were prosecuting me.” ordeal Peter told police he feared he had been raped at .am on June , . Swabs were taken at am on June . Peter’s ordeal had begun after he became separated from friends on a trip to Factory nightclub, Manchester. Sinaga spotted him and saw his chance. Peter said: “He offered for me to come to his flat because it was cold. “I am happy to chat to anyone. I said yes and I remember walking to his apartment.There was a kitchen area, but he took me into the bedroom and said he’d get me a few drinks.There were five or six bottles of spirits on a table. He poured a clear drink, I thought it was vodka or sambuca. “I felt comfortable, I thought he was around my age. He never once said he was gay.”  Peter told how Sinaga gave him two drinks. He said: “After the second I was dizzy, all over the place. “Last thing I remember was feeling sick and him saying, ‘You’re not in a good state to go outside’.I felt like I was really, really drunk, paralytic. I was seeing four or five of everything. “I didn’t want to pass out in this guy’s house, I wanted to call my friends or my mum to pick me up. I asked him for my phone, but he was saying, ‘No, you need to sit down’.He was calm and caring, like someone looking after a drunk friend.I blamed myself for mixing beer, spirits and shots. After that I have no memory until am, around four hours.” That was when Peter woke – and all hell broke loose. Bloodied Sinaga was treated in hospital for a suspected brain bleed.Police later discovered the rape footage on his phone – and hundreds of other videos led to police tracing more victims. Sinaga kept victims’ phones, business cards and passports as souvenirs. Forty-eight men gave evidence in four trials at Manchester Crown Court and he was sentenced to  years."},{"url":null,"title":"tesco urgently recalls cow ","story":"NewsTesco urgently recalls Cow  Gate baby food that may have been tampered withParents are being urged not to feed their children the Cow  Gate g jars of baby food from Tesco and insteadthem to the retailer for a refundShareCommentsByAmber Hicks:,  JAN NewsThe recall only affects the products sold by Tesco\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

While experts are tracing the origin of the deadly virus, many have suggested that the pneumonia-like disease could be down to a trend of eating live animals. Yanzhong Huang, a public heath expert at the Council for Foreign Relations, told Time magazine: This is just part of Chinese culture. They love to eat anything alive. He added that eating exotic animals can boost aposmale potencyapos, according to advocates. However, wet markets, especially those selling live animals, could be another contributing factor to the outbreak. A mixture of urine, faeces and other bodily fluids from live, wild creatures ends up mixing with blood from butchered animals, providing ideal opportunities for viruses and bacteria to thrive, it is reported. In the gruesome clip taken in , a man is seen picking a live frog from a stall inside a wet market before he bites onto its head. He rips the frogaposs head off and tears off its skin, revealing the bloodied meat and organs. He then devours the frogaposs brain in front of the camera.  Itaposs understood that the man is a known influencer who eats exotic animals during his livestream videos. Web users who watched the clip again were disgusted by the manaposs behaviour.

Scientists had lowered the three dead reptiles at a depth of one and a half miles in the Gulf of Mexico to understand how carbon-hungry creatures of the deep would react. Despite one alligator and its harness having a combined weight of .kg , a mystery predator managed to pull it ft through the sand, drag marks suggested. The rope was bitten completely through, allowing the predator to carry away its meal. When the scientists ed to the drop zone eight days later, they found nothing but an alligator-shaped depression in the sea bed and the weight with rope still attached. Another alligator had its bones picked clean within a few weeks and a third one was devoured by deep-sea crustaceans. Dr Craig McClain of the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium, which organised the drop, said there was no way to be sure of what had snatched the missing alligator. We have no video evidence for what removed that alligator, he said. Through a process of reasoning and exploring dferent options, we think that one of two species of shark is the most likely candidate. However, this remains a hypothesis at this time.  It is believed the predator might be a Greenland shark or a sixgill shark, who would have eaten the gator whole. The team had hoped that the reptilesapos tough hides would impede creatures of the deep from getting to the soft tissue underneath. Less than  hours later, scientists found a group of giant isopods, a type of crustaceans, had already penetrated one gatoraposs hide. When they checked up on the other alligator a month-and-a-half later, they found only skeletal remains, with no soft tissue remaining.  The bones also revealed a type of zombie worm, or osedax, previously unknown to science. The worms colonise bones and consume the lipids within, and have never before been observed in the Gulf of Mexico. Our group seeks to understand how carbon is cycled through oceans as well as the connections between land and oceans in the carbon cycle, said Dr McClain.

Beijing International Airport was almost completely deserted yesterday evening, as shown by chilling photos taken by a passenger. Suzan Tokdemir, , took the pictures after travelling on an almost-empty flight into the Chinese capital city from Hong Kong. In one photo, which Suzan took on-board the Hong Kong Airlines flight, two members of the cabin crew can be seen wearing clinical masks over their mouths while they serve refreshments from the trolley. Another photo shows only three people outside the airport in a space that is usually very crowded. The airport in the Chinese capital city has ranked second-busiest airport in the world every year since  and usually sees between  and  million passengers pass through it a year. Suzan, who teaches English at an international middle school in Beijing, said: It was quite eerie. Itaposs not what youaposd expect at Beijing Airport. It took me  minutes from getting off the plane to standing outside the front of the airport - that included collecting my luggage, passport check, fingerprint scan, everything. On the flight, there were only about  passengers. I looked around as was getting off the plane, and I estimated there canapost have been much more than  people. It was one of the big planes, with eight seats across in a row, but they put us all at the back of the plane - the front half of the plane was completely empty.  All the flight attendants were masked, and most of the passengers were too. They took them off to eat the food and then put them straight back on. Before we got off, they came round and disinfected the plane, and there was an announcement telling people to declare any symptoms they might have, Suzan added. Suzan, who left Phuket, Thailand on Friday morning, and flew back to Beijing via Bangkok and Hong Kong, said it was spooky to see the numbers dwindle on each of her connecting flights. Even at Hong Kong airport, almost everyone was masked, she said. At Beijing International Airport, we had to keep taking our masks off, so that our faces could be identied - which sort of defeats the point.  She added that even the motorway in Beijing was empty, saying: Usually you can hardly move on the motorway. The coronavirus has emptied Beijing. I had hired a driver to take me home, and he got stopped by masked police on the way back and had his temperature checked. It was really spooky, it was like something out of a sci-fi movie, said Suzan.

Travel giant TUI are believed to be the only British major travel agent still offering “dolphin ­experience” holidays to Brits – although the company insists they endorse only venues that uphold global animal welfare standards. It is estimated , dolphins will be captured in Japan’s “Killing Cove” this season. Tim Burns, campaign manager of The Dolphin Project which filmed the latest gruesome ­round-up, said: “The mortality rate is extremely high and the start of  has been bloody. “Holidaymakers who go to ‘swim with’ programmes have an idea that the dolphin was gently picked up off the coast and is thankful and happy to be in ­captivity. But the process in which they snatched is merciless. “Tourists are largely unaware how many creatures have died so they can swim with that one ­dolphin they meet. “We believe that for every , sea mammals captured, around  end up in captivity. The rest are killed for meat.” In the last week alone  ­mammals were captured and  were slain for meat, according to the group, which used a drone and clftop cameras. Hunters drive them into the ­shallows by lowering steel poles into the water and ­hitting the poles with hammers. The highly sensitive dolphins swim towards shore to escape the noise, only to be trapped by nets.  Those not wanted for training are slaughtered on land with a metal spike pushed into their neck – ­hidden behind tarpaulin sheets. Tim said: “These highly intelligent animals understand not only pain but the idea of dying. And they mourn the death of others.”TUI plugs the Atlantis Sanya resort in China which admitted buying from Taiji hunters in . The resort invites customers to “meet and interact with the ­dolphins while professional ­photographers capture this ­unforgettable moment”.  TUI customers can book ­online for a £-a-night stay at the five-star hotel. Rivals STA Travel, AirBnB and Virgin Holidays ­said they would cut ties two years ago. The British-based campaign group Dolphin Freedom UK is ­calling for TUI to sever ­connections with the dolphin entertainment business. It has collected , ­signatures for a petition and has ­organised a series of protests outside branches. The charity says le ­expectancy for dolphins bred in captivity is around  years compared with ­between  and  in the wild.  Marine parks in China, Japan and the Middle East are the biggest customers for the creatures. The trade, which has been ­going on since , is legal in Japan under their fishing laws. TUI also ­promotes firms Dolphin Discovery – based in central America and US – and SeaWorld in the US, both of which deny buying dolphins from Taiji hunts.  A TUI spokesman said: “We are committed to working only with ­venues that agree to uphold the Global Welfare Guidance for Animals in Tourism as ­formulated by the Association of British Travel Agents. The venues we feature are ­subject to an ­extensive and ­independent animal welfare audit ­programme to ­ensure they are ­upholding global ­animal welfare ­standards. We are in discussions with the venues to ­further improve animal welfare and ­address the issues.” Kerzner International, which owns the Sanya hotel, admitted buying  dolphins from Japan in  but insisted they are in good health and it would not support future collections from the wild.

Meanwhile the UK Government, led by Boris Johnson, has busied itself trying to convince taxpayers to raise £, in order to make the currently out of commission Big Ben ring again on #Brexit Day#.But what about ordinary Dundonians on the street – have punters really been that worried about the upcoming split “I’ve done no preparation at all,” said Val King, an admin assistant from Forfar.“It has come round quite quickly. I think everyone will be much the same they’ve been busy with Christmas, and this has just been ongoing the whole time.“You’ve had this thing about Big Ben, which has been absolutely ridiculous. What a waste of money.“You only have to look around and see how many people there are on the streets to know the money could be better spent.”Alex Simpson, , an art student at DJCAD, said: “I wasn’t old enough to vote at the time of the vote so people my age didn’t get a chance to have a say.“It’ll just be a case of seeing what happens. I don’t think anyone can really believe it’s happening though.“I really don’t think it will make much dference to people’s day-to-day lives, they’ll still get up and go about their day the same.”Monica Anderson, a retired council worker from Dundee, admits she’s still uncertain as to whether Brexit will actually take place.But she is hopeful it does – even though she was a remain voter in .Monica said: “I’m still waiting on it actually happening. I’m still doubtful it will actually happen because it has dragged on so long – but I would like to see it happen.“I voted remain before, but I don’t want Scotland to become independent from the UK so I would like to see Brexit happen.“I don’t think we should held hostage by politicians in Brussels. If there was another vote I would vote leave again.“I would say people are fed up – by now it is either going to happen or it’s not.”Sandy Robertson, , a former jute factory worker from Forfar, was less optimistic – and thinks leaving the EU is a mistake.He said: “I still think we should remain. Things should just be left the way they are. I think the English voters made a mistake when they voted to leave and we’re just having to put up with it.“It wasn’t Scottish voters who voted to leave.“I think there were a lot of people in the farming and fishing industries who influenced people to vote leave as well.“It’s just been a big mess that we’ve been dragged into against our will.”Earlier this month city councillors approved the latest recommendations put forward by officers to prepare Dundee  for Brexit.In his report before the council’s policy and resources committee, chief executive David Martin warned that Brexit continued to hold “signicant financial and operational risks” for the council.He wrote: “Both the Cross Party European Group and the officers’ Brexit Advisory Team have continued to meet regularly to consider the risks facing the council and the city in order to make any preparations possible.“Staff in frontline services across the council, including libraries and community centres, as well across our community planning partners, have been briefed and given a handout to support and signpost citizens.“In addition, we have worked with Dundee and Angus Chamber of Commerce to promote the scheme to their members and ensured welfare rights advice services across the city are briefed.#He said that the chamber had also recruited additional staff resources to support export documentation and to assist in wider preparedness work.In addition to that, elected members had been given information in case constituents raised queries via their surgeries.Mr Martin said: “Dundee’s Central Library is a location for the Assisted Digital Scheme for those needing help to make online applications, and we are also publicising the assistance available locally from the Citizens Advice Bureau.“The Children and Families Service and the Health and Social Care Partnership have been made aware of responsibilities for applications on behalf of looked after children and vulnerable adults.”He said that the impact on servicesthe council#s workforce was reduced as EU nationals left the country was low.  but that the authority had sought to re-assure those affected that we want them and their families to stay, and to signpost them to information and support.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e2ab665786043.48396401.jpg ","title":"callachan aiming to end below par east end record with dark blues","story":"East End Park is a venue Ross Callachan is no stranger to.In his six years in the Raith Rovers first-team, he took part in the Fe derby four times, twice in Dunfermline.On neither occasion, however, was the -year-old able to end up on the winning side.But Callachan is hoping to change all that tonight when he heads there as a Dundee player after joining on loan until the end of the season from St Johnstone last week.The Pars are on a poor run of form themselves, losing their last five in the league.However, Callachan insists that counts for nothing and all the Dark Blues can focus on is doing what’s required to earn all three points after the disappointment of exiting the cup to Motherwell in his debut last weekend.“I’ve played them a few times home and away but it’s always tough going to East End,” he said.“They’ll be looking to win, losing their last five games, so I think it’s a must-win for both teams.“It was disappointing to be out of the cup but at least we can focus on the league now.“We have  games left until the end of the season so, hopefully, we can go and push for the play-offs.”Callachan is realistic, however, and knows the pitfalls of the Championship from his time at Raith.With just four points separating Dundee in fourth and the Fers in fth, he hopes to draw on all his experience to help the Dee in this one and every game after.“It’s very tough. I think in this league teams can be inconsistent and, probably, Dundee have been like that themselves throughout this season,” he added.“Hopefully, I can come and help that. I’ve been in the league before with Raith and in the play-offs, too. I’ve been there and done it all before.”Although keen to kick on and help the Dark Blues this term, Callachan is just happy to be playing again after enduring a long spell out of the team at Saints.He only made four appearances for the Perth men this season, the last coming in September, and is enjoying feeling wanted again.“I’m hungry to play, do well and help the team,” he said defiantly.“I want to get games under my belt because it was frustrating at St Johnstone.“You’re sitting in the stands and you feel you can help the team but the manager thought otherwise.“I’m just happy somebody wants me here and I feel like I’ve fitted in right away.“Hopefully, I can go and play and show what I can do.“The initial attraction was Dundee were interested in me. My head was turned right away.“Obviously, not playing at St Johnstone made me want to come here.“The plan is to help the club get to where it wants to be, back in the Premiership.“We’re in the play-off spots now so, hopefully, we push and climb up to second.“Dundee United are going to win the league so the main thing for us is getting to the play-offs and going up that way.“We want to finish as high as possible.”Playing alongside and learning from quality players like Graham Dorrans is another reason why Callachan was happy to make the switch up the A, across Tayside.And he was delighted to see his team-mate sign a new deal this week.“He’s, obviously, played at a right high level and you can tell he’s a good player who can help the team.“Him signing a new deal can only be good for us.“It’s good for everyone we have that competition.“It’s good for the club and for the boys, competition is always good.”"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive hibs kid fraser murray set for dundee loan","story":"Hibs youngster Fraser Murray is set to join Dundee on loan until the end of the season, Tele Sport can exclusively reveal.The -year-old midfielder is a product of the Hibees academy set-up and has made  appearances for their first team.The Easter Road club are keen for him to get more game-time under his belt and hope a switch to Dens Park will offer that.The Dark Blues hope to have the deal sewn up this week in time for Saturday’s trip to Morton.Meanwhile, club-mate Sean Mackie has ed to Hibs after picking up an injury in his temporary spell on Tayside."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/KCes_Craigie_High_School_Police_Incident_Dundee_200519-14.jpg ","title":"major shake up of education in dundee to be debated as plans to merge craigie high and braeview academy unveiled","story":"A massive shake-up of education provision in Dundee has been unveiled by council leader John Alexander .The far-reaching proposals brought forward by Mr Alexander and his administration would see:Subject to consultation, a new £ million superschool, merging pupils from Braeview and Craigie, could be built at the former St Saviour#s High with a projected opening of .Braeview was ravaged by fire in September .

We see this as the way and Dundee and Angus College would be involved in taking this forward, with enhanced provision.#Both these schools are grade C in terms of quality and both need upgrading but looking at the financial elements we cannot afford it.#The priority is in the east and we cannot have Braeview Academy people sitting in portable cabins.#Mr Alexander, a former pupil of St Saviour#s High School, outlined how #vocational partnerships# between Braeview and Michelin would be continued at the new campus at Drumgeith Road.He added that a joint project between Dundee City Council and Dundee and Angus College would be launched to accommodate people with additional support needs.Mr Alexander said: #I spoke with three executives from Michelin and we are really focused on making things work.#The consultation,approved by committee on Monday, would start on February  and run until the end of March. We have to be honest with the public and we want the feedback from parents.#This is the very start of the process.

It is something they are all working on.“We will be ready to take our chances when we play St Mirren.”Although St Mirren are struggling in the bottom half of the Premiership, Aberdeen suffered a shock - defeat to them in Paisley back in August.Campbell believes there were mitigating factors for that defeat as the Reds had lost - away to HNK Rijeka in Croatia just days previously in the Europa League third qualying round first leg.He said: “We are approaching St Mirren as a ‘must win’ game as we really need to bounce back from the result against Motherwell. We need to go on a run of wins.“All our focus is on getting the three points at St Mirren.“We will keep that defeat to St Mirren in mind, although that came off the back of a midweek game where there was maybe a bit of fatigue.“This time we know what we are up against and are going out to get the right result.”Campbell is hoping to establish himself in a midfield that has been bolstered by recent signing Dylan McGeouch.The Scotland international arrived earlier in the January transfer window on a two-and-a-half year deal from League One Sunderland.Campbell said: “I am relatively happy with the season so far as I have played a lot of minutes for an -year-old.“There are not a lot of -year-olds who have played as many minutes in Scotland in the top ision as I have.“I have been happy in some of the games I have played and there have been mistakes in others.“It is all about learning for me as well.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road .

Christmas time had been dficult because it was the first Christmas without her granny, who had died earlier in the year. But now she was back at school and into the routine with her friends.Her parents had hoped this would help, but her sense of loss was still overwhelming for her. Perhaps at her age she didnrsquot understand exactly what was going on inside, but all she knew was that her granny shersquod loved was gone and she missed her.Then one evening during a bedtime story, Jessica started to cry and told her dad that her granny was melting like a snowman. At first he wasnrsquot sure what she meant, but then he understood.Jessicarsquos memory of her granny was fading. This was a second loss for her. The first loss was of her grannyrsquos physical presence, her actual hugs, her voice and care and love, even the smell of her perfume. Now Jessica was losing her memory of all this and she knew it. So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum. It was a terrying thought and it made her not just sad but scared and insecure inside.Her dad tried to reassure her that he or her mum werenrsquot going to die, but despite being only six years old, Jessica now knew that such promises couldnrsquot be kept forever.ldquoNana didnrsquot want to die either, but she did. And now shersquos melting.The next day at school was another dficult one for Jessica, and home time often didnrsquot make it better because in the past it had usually been her granny whorsquod picked her up.Her dad was waiting for her.ldquoWe are not going straight home today, he told her.ldquoWhere are we going ldquoTo Nanarsquos seat.A cloud suddenly came over Jessica. She didnrsquot say anything and just looked at the ground. This was a seat that overlooked the sea, where her gran had often taken her. They would sit together and look out to the Firth, spotting boats and looking for whales, while eating sweeties.Her dad had realised that Jessica hadnrsquot been there since the death of her grandmother.ldquoOnlyyou want to, he said.Jessica was silent and looked at the ground. Inside, her emotions were spinning. Then she looked up.ldquoI donrsquot want to, it will just make me sad, she said to her dad. So they didnrsquot go.But later that day, Jessica began to talk about Nanarsquos seat. ldquoShe always gave me sweeties and wersquod look for whales and pirates. She told me a story about how a pirate once landed here at Prestonpans, but he didnrsquot leave treasure, he just built the town.ldquoGreat story, said her dad.The next day, Jessica agreed to go to her nanarsquos seat. When they arrived, she hesitated to sit and had a wave of emotion.ldquoI miss Nana, she saidldquoSo do I. Shall we sit on her seat and miss her together.ldquoBut we have to eat sweeties.ldquoJust so happens Irsquove got some in my pocket, said the dad with a smile. His daughter smiled back and sat on the seat. Her dad joined her.ldquoNo, dad, that was Nanarsquos place, you sit this side instead.And so they sat, missing Nana together, being sad together, but also remembering her together.ldquoCan you tell me the story about the pirate  asked the dad.ldquoDonrsquot want to.ldquoOK, maybe next time.The next day, they ed to Nanarsquos seat. This time, Jessica told a bit of the pirate story. The dad remembered it from his childhood and realised that his own grief in losing his mother had closed him down to talking about her. It had felt too painful.He began to sit on lsquoNanarsquos seatrsquo by himself when Jessica was at school, even though he had never done it with his mother when she was alive he had always been lsquotoo busy to watch the sea with her. But his daughterrsquos anecdotes and stories about the seat made it feel like a place of remembrance for him too.The power of stories, to rekindle memory and ease the sense of loss, became very real for both Jessica and her dad. At home, they made a special box with drawings and photos of memories, and things that reminded Jessica of her gran. Theyrsquod take them out and tell stories and share memories. Her dad even began to tell funny stories about his mum from when before Jessica was born, when he was a boy.lsquoNanarsquos boxrsquo was put in a safe place, but where Jessica could take itshe wanted to. As time passed, she opened it less, but it was always in her room. Sometimes she would put things in it, such as shells from the beach, because her granny had loved beautul shells.The loss of a loved one can never be completely moved on from, so there were always going to be times of sadness.

been calling for a station toto the village, on the East Coast Main Line, for more than  years.Currently, it is planned that the station will be open before , with campaigners calling for it to be in place as soon as possible.Now, a letter has been sent out to village residents highlighting upcoming work in the area.The letter reads: ldquoWe will shortly begin survey work and site investigation activity on railway land in your neighbourhood.ldquoThis work is required to help the design of a new station at East Linton.ldquoOur work will involve detailed survey activities, which may require us to cut back some vegetation.ldquoOur site investigation work also requires us to use drilling equipment to check ground conditions in proposed development sites.ldquoWhere possible, the work will be carried out during the day.ldquoHowever, some of our investigations need to be undertaken on the railway embankment or directly underneath the tracks.ldquoIn order to access these locations, we will need to carry out the work at night while trains are not operating.ldquoDuring this period of work, we will have a small compound located on site to provide facilities for our staff.ldquoThe compound will be set up from Saturday February  until our work is complete and will be located adjacent to the railway, with access taken through Orchardfield Estate, East Linton.The works come at the same

questions from Mr Gray, which he submitted in light of the decision to end the Abellio ScotRail contract three years early, indicated that Network Rail are progressing with the station designs with

developing plans for the December  East Coast Main Line timetable, including services for East Linton.Mr Gray was pleased progress was being made but vowed to keep the pressure on to ensure there were no delays.He said: ldquoFollowing the governmentrsquos decision to cut short Abelliorsquos ScotRail franchise, I asked parliamentary questions about progress on delivering East Lintonrsquos new rail

I use this phrase to describe the spectacle of street lights at night when viewed from a vantage point.One of the best places in East Lothian to view the lsquoupside down skyrsquo is from the road by Farsquoside Castle. This vantage point gives you views over Wallyford, Musselburgh, Portobello and Edinburgh beyond.These urban areas create a sea of lights which look like a sky full of bright stars, except, of course, itrsquos lsquoupside downrsquo and theyrsquore not really stars. But it looks spectacular in its own way. In fact, views with bright city lights are these days often considered tourist attractions.But Irsquove recently realised something: while the lsquostarsrsquo of the lsquoupside down skyrsquo are getting more numerous and extensive every year, the real stars in the actual sky are becoming more dficult to see at least where I live.Literally thousands upon thousands of houses are being built in the western part of our county. Much of the rural landscape in this part of East Lothian, which I knew when I was a child, is going fast.Most of me understands and accepts the needs for this, but a part feels sad at the loss of a recognisable landscape. And already I have noticed that a by-product of this has been increased light pollution in areas close to where I live. It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way. Itrsquos a form of meditation with something bigger than we can imagine, but also something incredibly beautul.And itrsquos fascinating, as you try to identy the dferent constellations, and perhaps realise how much you donrsquot know or have forgotten. Could you identy the northern star, and what constellations can you see  Sailors in days of old were experts at identying the stars to aid direction, but Irsquom sure they also marvelled at the unhindered beauty and mystery of them as well.There are still many places in our county where we can be wrapped in star-lit darkness. But as the lsquoupside down skyrsquo gets bigger and brighter, the real stars are fading in so many places.The real shame is, as the stars disappear from our sight, they may disappear from our consciousness as well.Letrsquos not let that happen. Let us gt our children, and ourselves, with the noticing and gazing at the real stars in our sky and somehow find the time, even briefly, to stargaze."},{"url":null,"title":"garry-oconnor-referees-haddington-amateur-teams-successful-charity-match","story":"Haddington Town FC took time out over the festive period for a special friendly in aid of Back Onside.Former Hibernian and Scotland striker Garry OrsquoConnor, who is an ambassador of the good cause, refereed the match, which saw members of the amateur teamrsquos squad come up against one another on January .Matt OrsquoConnell, chairman of the club, which was formed last year, said they were determined to help support the charity, which helps young people and adults who face mental health challenges.He said: ldquoWersquore a club that was founded on the idea of bringing local guys together into a positive social and active environment.ldquoItrsquos well documented that the highest proportion of suicide across Scotland is men aged - and thatrsquos something we hope to positively redress in our town by facilitating a great environment in which local guys can improve not only their physical but also their mental health.ldquoOur connection with the charity Back Onside was really born of their slogan, #SupportThroughSport, a powerful statement that really resonated with us.ldquoTheyrsquore a great charity who are doing a hell of a lot across the UK and so for us, a small amateur club barely nine months old, to play a small part in helping a charity who share our ethos was immensely rewarding.Haddington Town play on Sunday mornings in Division Two of the Lothian and Edinburgh Amateur Football Association , alongside fellow county side Meadowmill.The charity match, played at Knox Academy, finished - in favour of the lsquoawayrsquo Haddington Town team.Libby Emmerson, founder and CEO of Back Onside, said: ldquoWe are beyond grateful for the support received from Haddington Town Amateur Football Club and guest referee Garry OrsquoConnor.ldquoAs a small charity with a huge clientele, community events such as the Haddington Town AFC charity match are key to raising funds and awareness so that we can continue to support those facing mental health challenges.Mr OrsquoConnell thanked everyone for their support, with the match raising pound, ndash more than double the target.He said: ldquoHuge thanks to Libby Emmerson, FES FM and Garry OrsquoConnor.

If it gets voted through, city chiefs will draw up an action plan to achieve the one million tree target in urban Edinburgh.This will include tree planting opportunities on both public and private land, via new developments and by replacing trees lost to age, disease and damage.Meanwhile, a new forum made up of representatives from a wide range of organisations will seek to find ways of planting more trees, more quickly.Representation will be invited from groups such as the Edinburgh and Lothians Greenspace Trust, the Woodland Trust, the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, Trees of Edinburgh, the Scottish Wildle Trust, the Trust for Conservation Volunteers and the Edinburgh Living Landscape Initiative.Annual tree-planting targets will also be set, with the overall number of trees publicly reported on an on-going basis.

Outside, birds were singing.Shersquod been in the hospice for a couple of days. On the Thursday it had reached the point where I was no longer able to look after her properly at home.I had spent the Friday night trying to sleep in a chair beside her bed. Every so often Irsquod lean over and talk to her as she slept, letting her know I was there. Or so I hoped. The voice gets through, one of the hospice nurses had told me.Just after eight her breathing changed. It began to slow and slow as I held her hand and cried. And then it stopped.Such a strangely peaceful thing, I remember thinking in between the tears. Nothing traumatic. Just a sht into stillness.An ending, one that had been waiting for us since she was first diagnosed with breast cancer in .Shards of memory from that morning keep coming back to me. They still cut me open.

The final moments we spent with her, all the words we didnrsquot get to sayunspoken.I am writing this three-and-a-half months later. No time at all.

Somewhere in the couple of weeks before she died, I guess, before illness took language away from her. A last time that I didnrsquot realise would be the last.The thing I struggle to get my head around is the way she is somehow everywhere and nowhere now. Every road I drive down, every song I hear on the radio, she is in them. Everything is a trigger, everything points to once-insignicant memories now charged and potent, small moments from the past suddenly weighed down with an impossible weight of loss and longing.I have nothing original or unique to say about grief. Irsquom sorry. No eloquence, no insight. Mostly itrsquos a drudge illuminated by spikes of pain.The truth is, I suspect Irsquom still only in the foothills anyway. I cry most days.

Football on the radio, bad movies on the telly, books that seem a safe distance from her memory.But griefrsquos a sneaky f***er. Last week I was reading a passage in a book about starfish. My subconscious made the connection for me. From starfish I thought of the word seahorse and suddenly I remembered Jeaniersquos tattoo, little black ribbons and bars of ink in the shape of a cartoon-cute seahorse.And, in the same moment, I realised that I hadnrsquot thought about it since she died. How was that even possible  Was it on her left arm or her right arm  Suddenly I wasnrsquot sure. was the cruellest year. On the last day of  we were told we had run out of treatments. In May we were told Jeanie had, at best, a few months. Before we left, I remember, her oncologist gave her a hug.How did we get through the rest of that day  Itrsquos a blank to me now.Weeks passed. Irsquod repeat my mantra to her most days. ldquoYoursquore okay today, so things are okay. I was in a state of deep denial. Jeanie knew better.By July and August it was clear that her illness was beginning to have a real impact. She began to lose memory and speech. It seemed a final cruel punishment for someone so articulate, so engaged with the world. The last weeks were marked by her slow withdrawal from all of us, a withdrawal that became final on that October morning.Three-and-a-half months ago. No time at all. An eternity.ldquoNo tenses any more, the poet Denise Riley writes in Time Lived, Without its Flow, her essay about grief in the wake of the sudden death of her son. ldquoHis sudden death has dropped like a guillotine blade to slice through my old expectation that my days would stream onwards into my coming le. Instead, I continue to sense my daily le as paper-thin. As it is. But this cut through any usual feeling of chronology leaves a great blankness ahead.No tenses any more. In truth, we both had been living in a continuous present for years, ever since Jean was first diagnosed. The first mention of the word cancer cut away the notion of a future.She was diagnosed in the autumn. ldquoIrsquoll not see Christmas, she told me then. We saw another . But even so the future, or the idea of it at least, had been taken from us, even as we grew older and watched our kids grow up.Worse, the past had been taken from us as well. It was too painful for her to think about. Even everyday intimacies and nothing-special moments were out of bounds. We had the present and nothing . And now I donrsquot even have that. I am already living in that great blankness that Riley talks about.That said, maybe I have the past again. I can revisit it. And I do.Most days I find myself fantasising about going back in time, inserting myself into a moment we once shared. It doesnrsquot have to be anything special. Just as long as we are together, where I can hear her voice, where I can see her face, where I can touch her arm, her cheek, know that she is there with me. Given the choice right now, I would live forever in that moment. Reliving it again and again.In some ways I already am. Just before Christmas I had our wedding video transferred to DVD so I could watch it. I donrsquot think I had ever watched it before,Irsquom honest. Now I canrsquot stop.Itrsquos not really a wedding video, just some footage my friend Mark filmed that day back in . Watching it again took me back to our old flat in Bruce Street, Stirling. There are our two cats, my sister-in-law looking impossibly young, my dad, Jeaniersquos dad, now no longer with us. And here are friends who have drted out of our lives.But, really, when I watch it, Irsquom only watching Jeanie. She would have been  when it was filmed. God, she looks beautul. She had her make-up done professionally that morning and she hated it. And yet on video itrsquos clear how great it looks on her.She hated being filmed. It explains why she hardly says anything in the video. That was not like her at all. I wish she had said more on camera, just so I can hear her speak. But the fact that she is there is enough, occupying a space in this world, a grainy image of her physical presence that is now out of touch.Already there is a moment in the video I find myself waiting for every time I put it on. At one point she comes through the swing doors that separated our kitchenette from the living room and, as the camera adjusts to the March light streaming through the window, itrsquos clear she is smoking. Jeanie is smoking.I had almost forgotten. How could I have forgotten  It had been something she had done as long as Irsquod known her.She would give it up a year, maybe  months, later with the same steely self-will she later brought to learning to play guitar or speak Esperanto. A task to be achieved.But in the fuzzy, flickering yellow video light, the image rolling and glitchy with age, she can be seen drawing fumes into her lungs with such obvious pleasure that the sight of it felt like a depth charge in my head, a memory of who she once was, of the girl I first met in a student kitchen in Stirling University in September . We were both  then. She was barefooted and wearing a headscarf because her hairdresser had given her a buzzcut, much to her disgust.She sat there smoking and swearing and talking. She was this leforce. I donrsquot know how  to describe her. She was self-confident and outgoing, all the things I wasnrsquot. I was totally smitten. What she saw in me, I still donrsquot know.In time I realised that we had some things in common. We were both working-class kids in a still largely middle-class environment. She had her own vulnerabilities like everyone . Irsquom not sure what I represented to her, but I was happy to represent something, anything.I asked her out. In the most roundabout of ways. And she said no. And then she said yes. And that was the start of the rest of our lives. We got together, stayed together, grew up, got married, had kids, were happy.In my head there are all these dferent versions of Jeanie the -year-old firebrand, the thirtysomething mother, the dedicated professional , the girl who would get drunk with her dad and her sisters every Hogmanay and start singing Leaving on a Jet Plane. The Jeanie who immersed herself in anything that interested her. The Jeanie who could make you laugh just by the way she looked at you.For a few days after her death I found myself resentful about the last incarnation of Jeanie, the one who increasingly was drting away from us, the one I had been caring for in the last weeks of her le. I loved that version too, of course, but the memory of this last Jeanie was so close, so tight against me, that I couldnrsquot see past her to all the others Irsquod spent the best part of  years with.It took my friends Karina and Michael to put me right. Jean and I had met Karina for a coffee in September just before Karina went back to Buenos Aires to look after her own sick mother. It was a farewell meeting. We all knew it.A few weeks later, after Jeanrsquos funeral, Michael told me what Karina had told him about that day, about how, when I was off where for a few moments, Jeanie had told her that she knew what was happening to her and that she was at peace with it.Hearing that felt like a damn breaking inside me. My viewpoint shted  degrees. Suddenly it came home to me how stoical that last version of Jeanie was, how brave. When she was initially diagnosed in , she had struggled to deal with it. But when it ed in  she refused to give into despair. All she wanted, she said, was to see the end of Game of Thrones. She managed that at least.The thing is she wouldnrsquot want you to know any of this. Jeanie was intensely private. She hated me mentioning her in anything I wrote. And this illness. Well, this was her business. But I guess itrsquos my business now. And what is this business  That Irsquom not sure I know. I do know that over and above losing her Ihave somehow also lost my own sense of self. I was so synced to Jeanie that I am now unfixed, ungrounded. What Irsquove realised in this no time eternity that Irsquom currently living in, is I donrsquot really know what Irsquom for any more.I am still a father and a son and a brother and brother-in-law and a friend . But I navigated through the world with Jean as my lodestar. And now that star has disappeared, and the night is dark.I donrsquot believe in heaven but I have taken to thinking about the possibility of parallel universes. I like the idea that somewhere there is another Jeanie even now. In most of them I guess she would never have met me. Or maybe she met me and didnrsquot like me, or vice versa . But I want to believe she is out there. Somewhere, I hope, Jeanie is smoking a cigarette and enjoying it as much as she does in our wedding video.In the week after Jeanrsquos death we put a notice in the Falkirk Herald. The Philip Larkin line from his poem An Arundel Tomb seemed appropriate: ldquoWhat will survive of us is love. It comes at the end of a poem in which Larkin is trying to suggest otherwise. But I want it to be true.Yesterday would have been your birthday, Jeanie. What survives of you is love. Thatrsquos why this hurts so much.

It will, above all, be a test of her judgment.If she persists in the fiction that she can have Indyref this year, her reputation may never recover.You can see why itrsquos hard to admit the gamersquos a bogie though.Besides letting down the SNP members she has marched up so many hills, Ms Sturgeon said a vote for the SNP last month would stop Brexit, stop Boris, and deliver Indyref.The first and second didnrsquot pan out, leaving her clinging to the third.If she gives up on that too, itrsquos three strikes. Not a good look for a leader under daily attack for over-promising and under-delivering in government.But a wistful climbdown is surely better than a damaging pantomime.After all, when she hit pause on independence for two years after the  snap election, she ultimately went on to greater success.Itrsquos hard to see who Ms Sturgeon could even convince. Not even SNP HQ appears to believe her timetable.Last week a number of former party luminaries said the Yes movement needed a new campaign vehicle, something like Yes Scotland in .But while the legal entity behind Better Together was dissolved after the No vote, Yes Scotland actually lives on, maintained in a state of suspended animation at Companies House by the SNPrsquos in-house solicitor.It could be cranked back to lewanted. Instead, it gathers dust.Then there are the campaign website names the SNP bought on the back of the Brexit referendum.You may remember the party launched a poundm fundraiser through the ref.scot website after Ms Sturgeon first announced in March  that she intended to hold Indyref.It has since fallen into disuse.The SNP also bought mobilise.scot and organise.scot as part of its push.The ownership has been allowed to lapse and both are up for sale again.Nor is there a refreshed case for independence, and time is flying by.The SNP has yet to prepare public opinion for its new position on adopting a Scottish currency as soon as practicable after independence.It has not said how it would respond to Brexit, particularly how it would handle trade and customs arrangements with Englandit was out of the EU and Scotland rejoined.ldquoIf we go into a referendum offering a hard border at Gretna wersquore f***ed, as one SNP MSP puts it.:Nicola Sturgeon: Scotland redefining what it means to be successful nationIndeed, itrsquos hard to see how anyone could offer such plans until we know what Brexit looks like - after the UK-EU trade talks this year.Then there is White Paper .It was reported yesterday that Ms Sturgeonrsquos officials continue to revise the slab-like prospectus of  to ensure Scots can make ldquoan informed choice over the future of our country.The Tories were duly outraged at this, given Mr Johnsonrsquos rejection of referendum powers for Holyrood.I was not at all outraged. As independence is the governmentrsquos avowed policy, it is natural for it to task civil servants with developing that policy. But where is it The original White Paper was published almost  days before the  referendum to give voters time to study its  pages.As Ms Sturgeon holds up that referendum as the ldquogold standard template for the next one, it would seem White Paper  is already late.Agreed, there are  days left in . But December and November arenrsquot candidates for Indyref because of Christmas and the massive COP climate conference in Glasgow draining police resources.The last practical date would be October, and that means there is already less time to study any new White Paper than last time.Yet the Scottish Government said only this week, in response to a freedom of information request, that it would be updating the White Paper ldquoover the next few months.Soit ever does emerge, there may be only half the time of  to come to ldquoan informed choice, plus it would be full of holes about Brexit.It would hardly be an advert for efficient, joyous government outside the Union - and thatrsquos before the stooshie about the bill for printing it and getting it to every household.Ms Sturgeon would be accused of taunting taxpayers with their own cash, sending them a non-prospectus for a non-referendum.The First Minister is a formidable politician. Her opponents may criticise her record and goals, but they respect and envy her ability.They would not characterise her as slapdash or unprofessional.Butshe were to blow millions on a rush-job White Paper without a legal referendum in sight, or play to impatient Yessers by attempting a hillbilly referendum of her own, that respect would be lost overnight.She would be damned as cavalier, a loose cannon not to be trusted with devolution far less independence.Ms Sturgeon wonrsquot like it, but her choice is between retreat now with dignity or retreat later without it."},{"url":null,"title":"fidelma-cook-got-english-casual-arrogant-ignorance","story":"She doubted many things in her ordinary, extraordinary le her middle years spent in England like many of her country women but she never doubted her right to live in a free Ireland.Born into a Republican family she was reared on the injustices meted out to her poor country as her own le weathered servitude, poverty, sickness and all the tragedies that make up a personal history.At the same time, Irsquom reading Victoria Hisloprsquos lsquoThose Who Are Loved,rsquo a family saga set against the backdrop of wartime occupation in Greece and the subsequent civil war.The two books couldnrsquot be more dferent in setting and pace and yet so alike in the fierceness of the determination of the two central women to set their countries free.One grew up in the Irish Free State, where homes were still ided in the bitter aftermath of the civil war, and the country lanes were dotted with hand spun memorials to the fallen and the murdered.The other fought with the Communists against foes who were once allies, and at warrsquos end, like so many, was tracked down, captured, re-educated by torture ndash by her own people whorsquod learned well at the hands of the fascists.One book a biography, the other a novel. One woman real, the other a beautully drawn imaginary portrait.Laying down the books what stayed with me was the essence, the spirit of both, and the feeling that one had grasped the mood of both countries.I know one country well, the other not at all. I know France well, or so I think, and certainly have grasped both history and mood all the more for living here.When I write about two of the three countries mentioned, I do so with the confidence of close contact of stories told and remembered of links forged republic to republic.I do the same with England and Scotland although I havenrsquot set foot in either for years. But I lived and worked in both. I switched listening modes from London to Glasgow as easily as switching TV channels and in Scotland reported on and witnessed a country rapidly evolving, gathering within it a fresh pride, a steely core to rid itself of dependence on Westminster. A desire ndash long before the words were so grotesquely appropriated by the Brexiters ndash to take back control.I lsquogotrsquo it. And I lsquogotrsquo the English too in their casual, arrogant ignorance and lack of interest in anything other than them.I got it having grown up in a country which also was powering towards a new destiny remembering the past but not in thrall to it looking forward to Europe and not back to the chains of an inglorious Empire.So, when I comment, I comment from a little knowledge, from a tapping in to, not just the history, but the spirit.It is why I am constantly surprised by commentators who pronounce on Scotland, on referendums and on the Party, which is the driving force for Independence.Many words are expended on reasons why that should not be, using suspect financial lsquofactsrsquo and endless repetition of half, long negated arguments that research would have knocked down immediately.Some of the arguments against Scotland leaving the Union are well-reasoned and well worth consideration but these too are knocked down by the lamentable chippiness of some who are as blind as the commentators they dismiss.Itrsquos a word blindness activated by what is seen as a malevolent force robbing and battering the Scots from time immemorial. That is not the truth but there is a truth contained within it.What irritates me above all in most of these comment pieces coming from over the Border, is absence, awareness. Absence of any attempt to delve under the demands to seek the almost indefinable ndash the spirit of a people.Any reading of history shows that movements grow slowly until suddenly, like a high tide, they gather and form until the point they are unstoppable.Sometimes though the expected tide doesnrsquot reach its watermark and flops against the bulwarks ndash becalmed, almost shocked at its sudden halt.If not careful, the Independence movement could reach that point and make no mistake, nothing is being spared by the Westminster Opposition to ensure it does.Confidence can be chipped away statistics twisted to enable doubt to take seed groups encouraged to agitate from within with public spats that only increase the nervousness of those unsure and uncertainthey want to leave the familiar.Cynicism in these times is good ndash but not too much. Passion is good ndash but must be controlled. Anger is good ndash but swallow pride and turn it outwards not back into the group.Much is made of Irelandrsquos struggle for independence and its success on the European stage. Some believe a whole nation rose up. In fact, the Easter rising was begun by a handful, ridiculed by Dubliners as they marched to the Four Courts.Captured, they could have gone down as yet another minor episode.

This has transformed the act of placing a bet on a sporting outcome.:Brian Rice case highlight how approach to gambling in Scottish football has to be revisitedPreviously, the issues associated with addiction and problem gambling were unintended and unsought. Irsquom not saying here you could ever have characterised this industry by its empathy for the flawed human condition. Once, there had been a degree of humanity though, where checks and balances might be provided simply by visiting a bookmakers and interacting with friends and neighbours.Now, billions are spent by the online gambling industry to ensure that addiction isnrsquot an unfortunate consequence but a desired outcome. And professional football, the most popular sport in the world, is where the lowest-hanging fruit is to be found.This week, Brian Rice, the respected manager of Hamilton Academical FC, became the latest high-profile football person to admit that he has been struggling with gambling addiction for most of his adult le.His story is only the latest in a long litany of human tragedies associated with football and gambling.Almost immediately the football tribe ndash managers, players and journalists ndash threw a protective cordon around him and praised Mr Rice for his dignity and courage in going public with his ordeal. Predictably, they strove to absolve the football authorities and our major clubs from any blame that might have attached to them owing to their lucrative association with online gambling.Some of their arguments were reasonable.After all, much of the sponsorship cash can be spent on developing young players and supporting nearby health and wellbeing initiatives in local communities.This though, is a bit like saying thatyou swim with sharks it can give you a greaterappreciation of their natural environment.  There is a reason why the predatory giants of the online gambling industry have targeted professional football. In no other sphere of human endeavour do so many working-class people gather in such huge numbers at regular intervals.According to recently reported research the industry is using third-party companies to collect personal data and thus enable online casinos to target low-income customers and ex-gamblers. One former digital marketing specialist in the industry said: ldquoThird-party data providers allowed us to target their email lists with precision. Lower-income users were among the most successfully targeted segments.The eye-watering profits accruing from gambling allow operators to use every artice and lever at their disposal to ensure they are ring-fenced. In the House of Commons several MPs recently sought to defend fixed-odds betting machines , the so-called ldquocrack cocaine of gambling in the face of Government proposals to limit them. These politicians were later revealed to have received expensive gts and hospitality from the betting industry.:Neil Cameron: Brian Rice case nothing to do with hypocrisySo vast and pernicious is the influence of the gambling lobby that in , the former Sports Minister, Tracey Crouch, was forced to admit defeat. She resigned after the government refused to back down on the timetable for reducing the maximum stake on FOBMs. She had wanted the change to be made earlier than the planned date of October . Yet senior colleagues ignored her even when she said that the delay could lead to hundreds of people killing themselves because of gambling addiction linked to these machines.Ms Crouch wasnrsquot indulging in emotional hyperbole here. In , research published in the journal Neuron, found that gambling makes people susceptible to depression and anxiety by altering the brainrsquos physical structure. Previous research had consistently found links associating gambling with debt, family breakdown and a suite of mental health issues.The new research though, found thatthese affective disorders diminish the capacity to tolerate economic risk.The online behemoths prey on menwhen they are at their most vulnerable. This is when they are watching live football and drinking.Their smartphone devices are weaponised by the online companies to extract as much money as possible from them in the two-hour window available to them.Odds are offered on every twist and turn of the action by a bewildering array of online products that bookend the televised pictures and analysis. The Gambling Commission recently fined a major online firm poundm after it missed more than  incidents indicating behaviour associated with a problem gambler. On one occasion the gambler immediately re-staked substantial winnings, suggesting this was either a money-laundering operation or an affluent addict. Yet this occurs much more often further down the financial scale but escapes scrutiny owing to the smaller sums.The football authorities which solicit these firms and the clubs who prostitute themselves to them are just as culpable in spreading the disease of gambling addiction. They are knowingly giving licence to these companies to destroy the lives of their most vulnerable and disadvantaged supporters.My own team, Celtic, have won more trophies than I could ever have hoped for during my letime. Yet I would gladly trade all of them to redeem the le of one person and their family ruined by addiction to gambling. And I would beseech Celtic and all other clubs who permit their colours to be contaminated by the logos of these online jackals to be rid of them and to work harder to attract more ethical and less-lethal sponsorship."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-city-council-write-prime-minister-scottish-independence","story":"The invitation was made during a debate on Scottish Independence at Thursdays full council meeting.During the discussion  councillors agreed that the local authority would write to Boris Johnson to demand that it should be up to the Scottish Government to determine another referendum.Councillor Susan Aitken also accused the Conservatives of taking on the role of a pantomime villain during the debate.:Tom Gordon: Nicola Sturgeonrsquos lsquonext stepsrsquo put her judgment on the lineLabour and Tory councillors argued that a \"once in a letime vote\" meant that and not every seven years and that the SNP should \"get back to the day job\".Councillor Euan Blockley said: \"I am not only upset and angry having to debate this in this chamber - thats  minutes of my le that Im not going to get back - but there are so many more things that this council should be focussing on.\"We have an education system in this country that is in a dire state of affairs.

And, it transpires, a little more prevalent than had previously been thought.A pound. million programme carried out by Nevis Landscape Partnership involving  separate projects on Ben Nevis and the surrounding glen has just reached its conclusion.Over its five-year lespan, it has seen , trees raised from seed by children and planted in Glen Nevis to help to replace trees lost to deer, disease and the elements, and a new accessible path created at the foot of the mountain. It has also seen art, education and community engagement projects which have boosted understanding of the mountainrsquos unique habitat and history.And for the , visitors who every year trek the Benrsquos well-worn km path, loose, broken and lost stones have been replaced ndash making it a far less risky experience.But perhaps the most challenging ndash and revealing ndash project was the one that combined the efforts of  botanists, geologists and mountain guides in a painstaking and sometimes daredevil search for some of the tiniest inhabitants of Britainrsquos tallest peak.The North Face Survey took scientists roped to mountain guides for safety to some of the Benrsquos most challenging corries, gullies and scree-covered slopes, in a ldquoneedle in a haystack search for tiny specks of plant le.Perhaps remarkably for a mountain which has towered over Scottish le for thousands of years, the survey ventured into areas never previously explored by scientists.As well as shedding fresh light on the extent of the mountainrsquos fascinating plant le ndash leading to Scottish Natural Heritage to upgrade conditions from ldquounfavourable to ldquofavourable ndash the survey forged a remarkable appreciation between the climbers, botanists and geologists for the mountain, and helped ensure one of its best-loved gullies would remain accessible to climbers.According to Mike Pescod, a mountain guide and chair of Nevis Landscape Partnership, a key element of the project was to assess whether rare flowers in number four gully were adversely affected by climbers ndash an issue which raised fears that climbing in the area might be curbed to help ensure fragile plantsrsquo survival.ldquoWhen we were introduced to the botanists they alluded to ice axe-wielding climbers who ripped out plants, he recalled. ldquoBut after three years of working together, it was clear we shared a passion and enthusiasm for the place, landscape and the plants.Better still, their labours were rewarded with a series of remarkable results.Before the survey, only around  populations of its target species of alpine plants were thought to survive the harsh conditions of the North Face.However, the survey identied more than , including fresh sites for some of our rarest alpine plants.:The walk: Ben NevisThey include tufted saxrage, with its small, jagged leaves that measure only -mm and tiny white flowers with pale green veins to attract passing butterflies and flies, generally found nestling amid scree and rock clefts. And also exceedingly rare wavy meadow-grass ndash Poa flexuosa ndash classed as ldquovulnerable and found in only a few locations across the country.Perhaps most unexpected, however, was the discovery of two species of plants not previously found on the Ben: alpine saxrage, with deceivingly resilient flowers and more commonly found in Iceland, Greenland and Norway and curved woodrush, a short, grassy herb found on windswept, rocky summits and plateaus.There were flashes of colour found in the harshest and hardest locations: emerald green leaves and deep red catkins of female dwarf willows were discovered nestling amid the granite of Tower Ridge, involving a heart-pumping scramble and rock climb to reach.Alpine ladyrsquos mantle, drooping saxrage and fresh populations of white-flowered Arctic mouse-ear were also recorded ndash unfortunately, some at higher altitudes than expected, hinting at a movement uphill in search of colder climes.As well as noting the plantsrsquo locations, details of their health and size were recorded to provide a baseline for future botanical surveys.Alongside the scale of finding and documenting tiny plants across a vast area, botanists and climbers faced dficult terrain and complex logistical challenges of carrying huge amounts of rope, safety equipment and survey items up and down the mountain each day. Simply reaching dficult spots pushed climbers and their non-climbing colleagues to the limit.ldquoThe botanists had a degree of climbing ability, and were very capable of climbing over slimy, muddy places which climbers think are horrible. But when it comes to rope systems to help access m high clfs, it was beyond what they could to, added Pescod.ldquoClimbers are usually looking for nice, solid rock, but thatrsquos not where these plants grow. There were loose bits of rock and sharp edges, making it all a lot harder.While the survey has ended, he said climbersrsquo new knowledge of the mountainrsquos alpine plants means they now seek them out during outings, snapping images to share with botanists and passing on what they have learned to others.ldquoItrsquos lovely to be able to climb and know what these plants are that Irsquom looking at, he added. ldquoIt elevates your day.Although the botanical survey was one of the most intense of the  projects, the most obvious one for mountain visitors was the extensive repair of km of the Ben Nevis Path, damaged by tens of thousands of walkersrsquo boots.Fixing it involved , volunteer hours and a logistical headache after stone intended for repairs and stored high up the mountain couldnrsquot be moved because of adverse weather.:Police issue advice to climbers following Ben Nevis deathsAlternative granite from a nearby quarry was ruled out because it came from the wrong side of the tectonic plate, meaning stone had to be sourced from quarries  miles away.After , helicopter lts of almost  tonnes of stone, a pound, investment and five years of work, the path was completed last year.As well as improvement and conservation work, the NLP five-year programme included the first excavation of Dun Deardail, a vitried hillfort at the head of the Allt nan Gleannan valley, new paths leading to the rock climbing area of Polldubh Crags and work to improve drainage at the summit.While the  projects, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, have been declared a major success, Pescod has warned a question mark over future financial backing means there is uncertainty over conservation and environmental projects on Ben Nevis and its surrounding glen.ldquoAll the brilliant stuff over five years has tangible results, but the organisation behind it is at risk of collapsing, he said.ldquoWe are losing unbelievable experience and skill in staff because of the funding system.ldquoSo many people want to visit Ben Nevis, but it needs investment to look after it."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  We re heading for a hard Brexit on Friday  but it needn t have been this way","story":"But you could be forgiven for being unaware of this historic occasion, because it only merited a footnote on news bulletins.

We really do have a major problem here.\"If you look where I live at St Cyrus, we have got rocks on the beach that used to be  foot high, they have disappeared now.\"Either you spend poundm now, or spend poundm in five or less years time, or you put Montrose underwater ndash take your pick.\"A Scottish Government managing flood risk team briefing from two years ago, seen by The Herald, highlighted the need for action over sand dune erosion that \"affect the golf course and the town in Montrose\".At that point it was estimated that between  and  metres of beach had been lost to the sea since the early s and that the Montrose coastline could wear away by up to  metres over the next  years.The experts believed the coastline has been retreating since the s and has been disappearing at a rate of two metres a year.While some had favoured a poundm coastal hard rock armour defence to be put in place quickly, the team suggested that this would just transfer the problem where.At that point, the government had made available funding of pound million per year for  years to enable local authorities to invest in flood protection works.\"The problem is that we are hitting the bottom of the dunes, it is simply eroding the dunes,\" said Mr Adams. \"It is getting serious now ndash becauseit breaches there it could go into Montrose, on the wrong tide and the wrong wind.\"A solution is being sought with discussions being held involving the Scottish Government, Scottish Natural Heritage, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Angus Council.\"We want the money pulled forward, we just need a solution for Montrose,\" said Mr Adams. \"It has to be substantial ndash you are talking millions.\"A  overview of the threat.Discussions about improving sea defences in Montrose have been going on for more than two years, but new surveys have been carried out because of concerns that the rate of erosion has increased with the two -hole links courses under threat.In  it was thought that a poundm cash injection from the Scottish Government would reinforce the beach and allow the dunes to recharge.\"Rock armour isnt the answer,\" said Mr Adams. \"Rock armour will work, but visibly it is awful. You are talking three miles. And at poundm every  metres it is bloody expensive.\"We have to find a solution and it has to be something that is sustainable.\"The other way to do it ndash a more sightly way ndash is to produce an island, which would be two or three kilometres long, slightly offshore. It will do something Annat Bank was doing, but in a dferent position.\"I believe that is what we need to aim for. It would last between  and  years. The material the MPA dredge out of the bay can be put on to it, in specic positions.\"It would be an engineered product, an engineered island offshore.\"The waves hit that further offshore, dissipate that, and you dont get that wave motion hitting the sand dunes at Montrose, and we need to get beach recharge as well.\"Prof Jim Hansom, the principal researcher of the Dynamic Coast project, who is finishing off an updated examination of the erosion threat to Scotlands coasts, said \"beach nourishment\" had to be a feature of any efforts to protect Montrose.: Open season. How Kelly Holmes has been part of a mental health podcast revolution.\"The bottom line is that the most effective defence against coastal erosion is a nice, big healthy beach that reconfigures its geometry depending on wave conditions,\" said Prof Hanson. \"So when the wave conditions are low, the beach is nice and flat and when wave energy is high the beach configures itself so that it is much steeper and more absorptive of wave energy.\"Unfortunately when we experience coastal erosion, we reach for engineers, and put a concrete seawall in its place. And a concrete sea wall is often exactly the wrong thing you need to be doing in those sorts of situations.\"A sea wall is going to be too expensive in Montrose and it is probably not going to be very effective on the beach. You want to keep the beach as a recreational asset, and you dont want to change its character, because it is a spectacular beach for all sorts of reasons.\"One view on the disappearing golf course.In , a UK climate change report warned rising seas and coastal erosion had left Montrose Golf Links ldquowith nowhere to go.And in the same year, Angus Council revealed Montrose Bay had been chosen as a ldquosuper site for research into the environmental problem.Montrose Port Authority has been accused of contributing to the erosion when it dredges in the area to keep the entrance to the towns harbour clear and then dumps the material in Lunan Bay a few miles to the south.Critics say this practice is \"wasting\" dredged material that could helped protect the dunes, and links director Chris Curnin has previously saidthe material was put on to Montrose beach in the ldquocorrect position it would have a ldquosignicant impact and slow down the erosion.However, the authority has long denied these claims, and an assessment it carried out in  said that episodic weather events ndash in particular wave direction and height ndash were linked to the greatest rates of coastal erosion in the area, which took place during the early s.This period also coincided with the production of a lower volume of dredged navigational channel material.It then insisted it must be able to continue dumping dredged material around Lunan Baythe port is to remain operational."},{"url":null,"title":"no-time-complacency-coronavirus","story":"Itrsquos going on five years now since I interviewed Professor Peter Piot.

Yesterday, Australia said the virus had reached its shores.Other nations, including the UK, are investigating suspected cases of the outbreak that causes severe acute respiratory infection with symptoms including a fever and cough.

For the simple inescapable fact is that infectious diseases know no boundaries.:Coronavirus outbreak: What are the symptoms and how does it spread Global health experts have long since argued that ease of travel in todayrsquos international community means the world must always be prepared for disease outbreaks. As history itself shows, itrsquos no longer whether an infectious disease outbreak will happen, but when.As far back as , the Spanish flu pandemic infected about  million people globally, at that time one-third of the worldrsquos population and caused the death of  to  million victims.

Such epidemics bring with them a huge economic toll in countries often already struggling.Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and other countries affected by the Ebola outbreak lost . billion in combined GDP, and the world had to mount a co-ordinated response at the cost of billions of dollars to contain the scourge.Ebola, of course, along with other infectious diseases continues to be a huge problem. Of late, Ebola and measles outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congohave killed , and over , respectively. Polio, too, has made its malign presence felt again in places like Afghanistan and other countries where it had been eradicated.The current Ebola outbreak, which began in August , is the second worst on record since the West Africa episode of -, even though it took the WHO until July of last year to declare this outbreak what it calls a ldquopublic health emergency of international concern .That decision by WHO brought a mixed reaction from public health officials with detractors saying it was long overdue and that unnecessary bureaucracy had prevented the designation sooner.Part of the problem, say health experts, is that in outbreaks that have dragged on for years, the word ldquoemergency refers to lots of contributing factors, among them mortality rates, the scale and global distribution of population affected,and the capacity to pull together international resources.According to a report released in September last year entitled A World At Risk by experts who make up the Global Preparedness Monitoring Boardndash set up by WHO and the World Bank ndash the world is largely unprepared for the next outbreak or pandemic.Described as a ldquosnapshot of where the world stands in its ability to prevent and contain a global health threat, the reportrsquos findings make for alarming reading and suggest that previous recommendations were either poorly implemented, or not implemented at all, and that serious gaps persist.ldquoFor too long, we have allowed a cycle of panic and neglect when it comes to pandemics: we ramp up efforts when there is a serious threat, then quickly forget about them when the threat subsides. It is well past time to act, the report concluded.It detailed how, between  and , WHO tracked , epidemic events in  countries. Among these events, the report said, epidemic-prone diseases such as influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome , Middle East respiratory syndrome , Ebola, Zika, plague, yellow fever and others are ldquoharbingers of a new era of high-impact, potentially fast-spreading outbreaks that are more frequently detected and increasingly dficult to manage.Too much talk of preparedness in recent years and not enough action appeared to be the stinging conclusion drawn by the health experts comprising the GPMB.ldquoAfter every single major outbreak, and you go back to Sars, HN, HN, Ebola in -, you see the same thing in many of the humanitarian disasters, insisted Alex Ross, director of the GPMB Secretariat.ldquoA lot of money goes into response and then it simply disappears right afterwards, Ross told the global development media  Devex, reacting to the report at the time.As the A World At Risk report also highlighted, almost always it is the poorest that suffer most. Negative impacts, it points out, are particularly profound in fragile and vulnerable settings, where poverty, poor governance, weak health systems, lack of trust in health services, specic cultural and religious aspects, and sometimes ongoing armed conflict greatly complicate outbreak preparedness and response.Many of the countries and societies most vulnerable are already under strain from some of the worldrsquos biggest killer diseases.Malaria, for example, which has killed perhaps billions throughout history, continues to be one of the biggest killers even today.Researchers have pointed to malaria being with humanity for over , years, with startling claims that the disease has wiped out half the people who ever walked the Earth.Speculative historical figures aside, according to the latest data from the WHO, annual malaria deaths are declining, but the disease remains one of the most prolic illnesses with as many as  million infections in  alone.Dengue fever is also a growing worry with half the worldrsquos population at risk. Like malaria and Zika, the Dengue virus is mosquito-borne, and thus can spread quickly among populations. It is estimated that there are  million new infections each year.Then there is cholera which researchers have estimated there are . million to . million cases each year. While easily treatable, cholera outbreaks typically occur when conditions are severe after natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes, making it dficult to treat those who need it.While Ebola and the current outbreak of coronavirus make international headlines, other diseases like Aids, flu, tuberculosis and pneumonia rarely grab media attention in the same way but also kill millions around the world.Though China has now responded quickly to the coronavirus despite earlier criticism of lethargy on the authoritiesrsquo behalf, what the crisis has again exposed is how it only takes one countryrsquos vulnerability and ill-preparedness in the face of infectious outbreaks to spell major problems for nations far beyond its borders.Citing the  global flu pandemic, in its executive summary, the A World At Risk report painted a chilling picture of what might happen given parallel circumstances today.ldquoIf a similar contagion occurred today with a population four times larger and travel times anywhere in the world less than  hours, - million people could perish, was its terrying summary.In addition to this tragic level of mortality such a pandemic could also cause panic, destabilise national security and seriously impact the global economy and trade, GPMB findings concluded.Faced with such potential doomsday scenarios, the monitoring board pulled no punches in what it sees as immediate and required actions. Paramount among these was an appeal to the United Nations to strengthen its global co-ordination mechanisms.The GPMB also stressed that ldquoWHO should introduce an approach to mobilise the wider national regional and international community at earlier stages of an outbreak prior to a declaration of a public health emergency of international concern.This weekend, at time of writing, WHO has yet to declare the coronavirus a global health emergency. The semi-autonomous Chinese city of Hong Kong, meanwhile, has declared its own health emergency and said schools would be closed until mid-February. And as Wuhan and parts of China remain in lockdown instead of celebrating the Lunar New Year, the crisis grows by the hour.In , Professor Peter Piot published a book entitled No Time To Lose: A Le In Pursuit Of Deadly Viruses, which chronicled his work, including the discovery of Ebola.On Friday, speaking of the coronavirus, Piot stressed again that there was no time to lose and that regardless of the decision not to declare it a global health emergency, intensied international collaboration and more resources will be crucial to stopping the outbreak in its tracks.ldquoThere cannot be any complacency as to the need for global action, he warned, adding the outbreak was at a ldquocrucial phase.Only the coming days will tell whether the WHO shares that same sense of urgency."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-celebrations-rub-noses-it-says-heseltine","story":"The Tory peer, who fought for Britain to stay in the EU, told The Observer newspaper the raft of celebrations risked exacerbating national isions at a time when sensitivities over leaving Europe were still high.ldquoBrexit is the most isive issue of modern times.

In January last year, we featured his incredible aim to run  ultramarathons along some of Scotland’s ancient pilgrim routes.The Running Home  challenge combined his two passions – running and his work with charity Embrace the Middle East, for which he is regional manager for Scotland and the north of England.He hoped to raise £, to rebuild war-torn areas of Iraq while covering the  miles, gathering support and funds along the way.While there were times when Mark didn’t think he’d see the finish line, he successfully completed the challenge.He also surpassed his fundraising tally – with £, currently banked.And he’s hopeful that even more funds will be amassed before he travels to Iraq this spring to see it put to good use.Marksaid: “There were occasions when I wanted to go home.“I knew,I was to quit, I was going home to a nice, comfortable house. The people I was running for don’t have that option.“That was a monumental reason to keep going.”Mark had extraordinary support along the way, not least from his crew – Gareth Brocklebank and Andrew Clarke – who followed him in a camper van, which also acted as shelter in areas where overnight BB stays were not an option.Mark’s we Karen and his two daughters also cheered him every step of the way as did many strangers.“People welcomed me into their churches and communities and generously donated large sums of money,” he said.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.hawick-news webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Hands-on...Superintendent Sharon Comriehas worked for the SSPCA for an incredible  years.

I was feeling great but, within ten minutes, a niggle turned into barely being able to walk.“I had to find a couple of sticks from the woods to use as shin splints.”However, it was an earlier, shorter run – St Cuthbert’s in March – which cost Mark a full day and also taught him a very valuable lesson.“I wanted to run from Melrose to Lindisfarne, where I planned to stay overnight, but I had to be there for a certain time due to the tide restrictions.“I got lost early on and was chasing my tail for the rest of the day. I started pushing really hard and ended up lost in the hills for  minutes, with no water, torchlight or phone charge.“I rushed checkpoints and didn’t take the time to check my kit properly.“I was dehydrated, didn’t stay on Lindisfarne and lost a whole day because of it.“It taught me a very good lesson – that I couldn’t do it alone and that these runs were pilgrimages, not races.“I had my tail between my legs the next couple of days but the reception at Durham Cathedral reminded me of what I was doing and why.”Mark enjoyed a similar reception at the Forth Bridges, where supporters and family joined forces to cheer him on before he reached the finish line in St Andrews on November .The following day, he addressed parishioners in St Leonard’s Church.It was the perfect place to end Running Home as St Andrews was once such a centre of pilgrimage.Mark took a breather to enjoy Christmas and New Year but has a busy  planned.He added: “I’m heading to Iraq in the spring to see how the money is being spent.“I also plan to revisit some of the places and people I met this year, by car though!“I passed through a lot of villages that were torched in the Highland Clearances.“People were forced out of their homes, and in some cases country, so there’s a sense of solidarity there with today’s refugees.“I was conscious of not being able to spend much time in places where I got a great deal of support.“So I’m hoping to revisit some of those communities, combining storytelling and traditional folk music to consolidate the friendships I made this year.”Karen is not keen for Mark to pull his running shoes back on too soon, but he will be taking on the York Marathon in October.

Currently, it supports communities in northern Iraq, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Egypt and Syria. Mark said: “Our focus is enabling people to rebuild their livelihoods. We do that by offering skills training in everything from computer skills to bee keeping. That one struck me as odd but it turns out everyone loves honey!“Embrace the Middle East also supports intercommunal peace building. The charity is led by local partners and shows how changes, big and small, can make a dference.”While many Iraqi citizens have chosen not toto their homeland, Embrace is there to help those who do.Mark added: “Their homes and agricultural land have been damaged. Our focus is future-proofing their ability to stay in their communities.“We’re not an NGO which is there for a short-term fix – we are there for the long term.”As well as working for Embrace the Middle East three days a week, Mark is an honorary fellow at Aberdeen University and has also taught social sciences at Stirling and Durham Universities."},{"url":null,"title":"support for social enterprise","story":"Local social enterprise Wood RecyclAbility has received funding support from international firms in a bid to help their expansion plans.Wood RecyclAbility is looking to raise £, to expand and offer more opportunities for adults with learning disabilities.The social enterprise has been providingpractical work experience and training for people with additional support needs for  years and has prevented over , tons of waste wood from going to landfill.The social enterprise makes a range of products such as bird tables, planters and garden benches from the waste wood.The Ellon-based organisation has now received a £, funding boost from CNOOC International as they look to purchase equipment to ersy their work by recycling rigid plastic and mattresses.This comes after BP offered £, last month to support their work, along with a new contract secured with NHS Grampian to create  lockable boxes made from recycled wood.Aberdeenshire East MSP Gillian Martin welcomed the funding and said: “I know this money will make a real and tangible dference.”Operations manager Brian Reid said: “This is a fantastic start to our fundraising efforts, to enable us to recycle more rigid plastics and embark on mattress recycling.“As a social enterprise we really appreciate the generosity given to us both in terms of time and funding from CNOOC International.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

I was surrounded by a phenomenal group of kind and supportive people from all walks of le who had me laughing through every mental and physical challenge the wall had to give us. The views are so breath-taking no photo can do it justice, the challenge pushed me past my limits and rewarded me in ways I never expected.“I learned so much about the Chinese culture and had the adventure of a letime. I made the most amazing memories and I cannot recommend it enough to anyone , I will cherish every moment for the rest of my le and feel privileged to have been had this experience and to have raised funds and awareness for CLAN at the same time.”CLAN head of income generation and business development Fiona Fernie commented: “We are so grateful to everyone who undertakes challenges to raise money for CLAN.“We never underestimate how hard people work to raise money for CLAN and it is rewarding to hear when our supporters have had really positive experiences doing so. CLAN receives no statutory money from government bodies, and our services are completely funded by the work we and our supporters do.“In , we saw a % increase in the number of people who came to us for support, and so we need even more people to join us in fundraising.“The group that went to China in October had the adventure of a letime and the money they raised will go towards providing wellbeing support and services for people affected by cancer across the north-east.“Taking part in a challenge such as the Great Wall of China can be daunting so we are delighted to welcome the team from Global Adventures and some of ’s participants who I know will share their enthusiasm and help build excitement for the  trek.”For more information please contact fundraising@clanhouse.org or visit the CLAN website.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Ellon Primary School pupils with the cooking team and their special guests at the kitchen opening event\"  School celebrates new kitchen viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"traffic","story":"ScotRail has launched a new campaign encouraging people to stop and think about their own personal safety while travelling or at work.

While HIAL has gone through the motions of consulting, having clearly failed to take on board any of the concerns raised, it is dficult to see what purpose this has served.“Since the announcement last week, I have been in discussions with local ATC staff who feel badly let down by HIAL.  Nobody disputes the need for modernisation, but even HIAL’s own consultants concluded that the remote tower model was the most costly and risky option. Alternatives were identied that could have delivered the improvements needed at a fraction of the cost.“While I welcome that HIAL is to carry out an island impact assessment, given its approach to consultation so far, there have to be questions over how robust or independent this assessment will be.#In the meantime, ministers must wake up to the scale of opposition and dissatisfaction amongst HIAL’s ATC staff. They should also recognise the clear threat this poses to delivery of leline air services in Orkney and across the Highlands  Islandsstaff choose to vote with their feet. That alone should give Ministers pause for thought and allow more time for alternative options to be explored”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

When he first came to this country, in , his English was almost non-existent. He made many mistakes. On one occasion he put a letter in a bin bearing the legend LITTER. But he was a hard worker and a quick learner. And by the mid-s, he could hold his own at Scrabble. One of my memories of him involves him freaking out because he had forgotten the Italian word for grapefruit. It’s “pompelmo” – one of the few words I do remember from back then, along with “zanzari”and “fiammeri” .I wasn’t brought up bilingual. My dad worked long hours and I spent most of my time with my Scottish mum. Instead, I was sent to Saturday morning Italian classes, which I hated because most of the other children there spoke it at home. Now and again, my dad would decree the dinner table an Italian-only zone. Those nights I ate in sullen silence.Then, when I was , my dad died, and so, though I later went on to sit my Higher, I never became fluent enough to keep up with the noisy, free-flowing conversation that is integral to Italian family le.With hindsight, this feels like a pity. Being able to speak more than one language is a gt. It widens your horizons and makes you more employable Also, language and culture are intimately connected. A country’s language shapes its ideas as surely as it expresses them. It is fundamental to its identity and its sense of humour. When you do not share a language, it is dficult to share jokes. And the ability to share jokes is at the heart of human relationships.My lack of fluency was in part responsible for my eventual detachment from my Italian heritage. If your language skills are patchyyou are unable to grasp sub-text and innuendo and nuance, then, however hard you try to belong, you will always be on the outside looking in.I have been thinking about all this since I read about the Comhairle Nan Eilean Siarplan to increase bilingualism. From next year pupils starting primary will be taught in Gaelic, switching to English only in Primary , by which point speaking Gaelic ought to be second nature to them.The idea is inspired. Around , of the Western Isles’ population speak the language and more than half of parents already opt into Gaelic Medium Education . However, by making GME the default setting, with an opt-out for parents who are opposed, the local authority is positioning bilingualism as the norm.Anyone who has witnessed their primary school child being taught French as part of the Scottish government’s + policy will understand the limitations of trying to shoe-horn a foreign language into an overcrowded curriculum. GME overcomes those limitations. And it’s an approach that is increasingly popular where. The number of children enrolled in Canada’s French immersion schools rose by a fth between  to  as aspirational parents realised the educational benefits.In this context, Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith’s intervention last week looks out of touch. She called the Western Isles’ move “deeply troubling” and suggested being taught in Gaelic could put pupils at a disadvantage. But there is no evidence for this. As human cognitive neuroscientist Dr Thomas Bak pointed out in a letter to The Scotsman such a view is based on the assumption that – as there is only a limited space in our brain – adding something new means taking something  away.“It assumes all pieces of knowledge that we learn are unconnected,” he wrote. “This is not the case. Every new piece of information we get is integrated with already existing knowledge and in this way can strengthen rather than weaken what we know already.”Studies show bilingual children outstrip their monoglot counterparts in cognitive tests and these advantages extend into later le with bilingualism linked to the delayed onset of dementia and better recovery after a stroke.Encouraging more Gaelic speaking will also redress some of the damage done by the  Education Act and help reconnect the next generation with their own culture. This pernicious piece of legislation put an end to Gaelic medium schools and punished those who continued to use the language.Establishment contempt for the country’s minority languages continued into the second half of the th century with those who expressed themselves in anything other than standard English still belted as late as the s.Not surprisingly this evocative language started to die out. Between  and , the number of Gaelic speakers dropped from , to , .In the s, however, there was a sht in thinking. Politicians began to realise the potential for Gaelic to revive depopulated areas and stimulate economic growth. There was increased funding for Gaelic arts, television and education, with Gaelic medium schools opening in the central belt as well as in traditional Gaelic-speaking areas.Until recently, there was a cross-party consensus on its importance. In , a law to protect and promote Gaelic was passed by the then Labour administration at Holyrood.As with much , however, Gaelic was re-politicised by the indyref with ultra unionists perceiving it as a nationalist totem. So now, every attempt to bolster it is met with a backlash. How much ink has been wasted whining about the cost of Gaelic road signs  Though, Transport Scotland says only £, was spent between  and , and the Scottish government has only ever received two complaints.The same sentiments have been expressed over the addition of Scots on to the primary school curriculum, although reading a handful of poems is unlikely to turn pupils into SNP activists.It’s not unusual, of course, for minority languages to face opposition. Disagreements over the Irish Language Act – which should give the Irish language equal status in Northern Ireland – contributed to the collapse of Stormont. But such hostility is short-sighted. Moderate and culturally-minded unionists understand this. Last week, Donald Cameron, Tory MSP for the Highlands and Islands, tweeted his support for the Western Isles’ plan . Distancing himself from Smith, he said his party had been promoting Gaelic for  years.This was not the first time Cameron had spoken up. In , he appealed to ultra unionists to tone down their rhetoric on the language. Having studied it himself, he understands its value.What the Western Isles is trying to do is impressive. If it succeeds it will produce a generation of children as much at home with Gaelic as with English. As someone who missed out on bilingualism, I’m glad its pupils are being given a skill that will keep them in touch with their heritage. And I find it deeply troubling that anyone would seek to stand in their way.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brian cox i regret becoming a cbe and would never accept a knighthood","story":"Scottish#actor#Brian#Cox#has said he regrets becoming a CBE and would never accept a knighthood.The Dundee-born star said he should have \"thought better\" after accepting the honour in  for his services to drama.Cox, , has campaigned for Scottish independence and said he didnt think he would be made a Sir because of that.But he insisted he would turn it down anyway as he feels uncomfortable with the royal family and the honours system.He said: \"When I became a CBE I did it at a time when I should have thought better but I accepted it because Im fickle. - Hollywood actor Brian Cox calls for second Scottish independence referendum \"I have a royalist sister and a republican sister and I thought well my royalist sister will be happy but she couldnt give a s**t.

The cap only affects concerts and other major events which close off all or part of the park to non ticket-holders during normal opening hours.The business plan, which is due to be discussed by councillors next week, would effectively give the green light for major events like the Summer Sessions pop and rock concerts, the Fly Open Air dance music festival, the cityrsquos festival fireworks finale and the Hogmanay concert in the gardens to continue.The proposed limit on events which restrict public access to the gardens is three times the size of a previous official cap, which has been in place for years. It was effectively relaxed when the council decided to treat an extended series of concerts as one event.The business case also raises the prospect of new medium-sized events being staged in the gardens, such as the ldquoSummer Nights events held in Kelvingrove Park in Glasgow. It is thought there would also be flexibility to accommodate large-scale one-off events involving the likes of the BBC, MTV or the Tour de France.The overall vision for the project, which has been in the planning for five years, is to \"create and sustain a space for all in the heart of the city, celebrating nature, reflection, community and performance.\"Income from all-ticket events would help subsidise the staging of smaller-scale events in the gardens, such as a Pride event, cinema screenings, showcases for buskers, school prom events and light shows.Other new events could include theatre productions, traditional arts and culture events, live music performances, spoken word events and family activities. Under the vision for the future of the park, which dates back to the mid-th century, ldquoevery Edinburgh citizen and visitor to the city will have experienced West Princes Street Gardens and the Quaich Project. Community groups would only pay a nominal fee, which could be as low as £, for the use of the gardens for their events under the new financial model, with the city council handling bookings from event organisers and promoters.It is hoped up to £, a year could be generated from the hiring out of the gardens for events and income from the new two-storey ldquogateway centre, although running costs for the new-look gardens are estimated to come to up to £, in future.The Quaich Project, a public private partnership being pursued by the city council and a trust set up by Apex Hotels founder and former Edinburgh Playhouse owner Norman Springford, would see the run-down Ross Bandstand, which opened in , replaced by a ldquoHobbit House-style pavilion for performances and an amphitheatre instead of the existing concrete bowl.A two-storey complex featuring a visitor centre, cafe and corporate hospitality facilities would offer direct access from Princes Street and boast spectacular views of events below Edinburgh Castle. The business plan has been published ahead of detailed designs for the revamp of the park being submitted to the council in the spring. A key aim is to deliver ldquoa balanced programme of activities ranging from small scale community events  learning programmes to festivals and major events throughout the year, befitting a capital city, world class visitor destination and much-loved public lsquogarden.rsquoIt states: ldquoWe will curate the use of spaces and activities throughout West Princes Street Gardens to enable a primary focus on community events which reflect the nature of the spaces involved.\"These include school and family events, lectures and talks, garden and nature tours, traditional art and culture, live music and theatre, heritage and historical programmes. The new facility will be offered at low cost for community groups and schools.ldquoWe will also procure and programme a specic number of major events which will provide high profile and high-income streams to create the affordability to community groups.ldquoWe will promote and market the project to a wide range of community bodies, schools and colleges, event and festival organisers to ensure that a healthy balance exists to enable an active yet tranquil and accessible space across the year.It is hoped that the impact of the Quaich Project will help the west end of the city withstand the impact of the new St James development, which is due to open later this year. Work is also due to be finished within months on a new Johnnie Walker visitor centre in the former House of Fraser department store, while there are plans to turn the former Royal Overseas league building opposite the bandstand into a hotel.The blueprint states: ldquoSitting in the heart of Scotlandrsquos capital, the Quaich Project offers a unique  for promoting a wide iety of activity in a spectacular setting, underpinned by a core aim of providing a mix of events and activities that fulfil our mission.ldquoIt also offers a catalyst for the re-imagining of Princes Street and its environs. With the opening of the new St James Centre and the refocusing of retail activity to the eastern end of the city centre, the project has the potential to drive the context of the area ndash cultural, social, wellbeing and environmental themes dominating a space currently occupied by buses and shops.In his report for next weekrsquos culture committee, place director Paul Lawrence states: ldquoThe completion of the refurbishment and development of West Princes Street Gardens in general, and the redevelopment of the Ross Pavilion and the construction of the associated gateway building in particular, is to the benefit of residents, visitors, event organisers and festivals, and Edinburghrsquos reputation.Donald Wilson, the city councilrsquos culture chief, said: ldquoThis is a very important stage in the project to reimagine West Princes Street Gardens.ldquoThe core focus for the business model is on community access and activity by creating and sustaining a space for all in the heart of the city, celebrating nature, reflection, community and performance.ldquoThis is a model where big events that involve exclusive access to the gardens are kept to a minimum, but these will make it possible to offer low cost rental of spaces to community or charitable organisations. Crucially, it proposes no more event days than we have at present.ldquoWest Princes Street Gardens are open almost every day of the year, with early closure for events, mainly in the evenings, amounting to less than % of normal opening times. It is estimated that within the new operating model this would continue.ldquoThe proposed new access route behind the pavilion is estimated to reduce event set up and takedown times by at least  per cent, thus reducing the impact on the gardens.David Ellis, managing director of the Quaich Project, said: ldquoOur vision is to improve the entirety of the gardens with a focus on making them a more enjoyable and accessible place for the benefit of Edinburgh residents and visitors all year round. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"ian blackford independence is a beacon of hope for people in scotland","story":"The SNP Westminster leader said that Scotland had been \"consistently sidelined\" during the Brexit process, and as a result should be allowed to hold indyref.He added that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had \"completely trampled over the devolution settlement\" and people in Scotland were \"right to be outraged\".His comments came as his party welcomed a new poll which showed a majority of Scots backing Holyroodrsquos right to decide on holding an independence referendum.The Survation poll, commissioned by Progress Scotland, found that  per cent of Scots backed the Scottish Parliament making the decision on whether or not an independence referendum should be held, compared to  per cent who thought Westminster should decide.: Mhairi Black: A wildcat Scottish independence referendum should be consideredThe UK government has consistently ruled out granting the Scottish Governments demand for a Section  Order, to transfer the power from Westminster to Holyrood for the holding of a second independence referendum.Boris Johnson has said that the  vote was sold as a \"once in a generation\" event by the SNP, and Mr Blackfords party had to abide by the result, which saw  per cent of Scots voting to remain in the UK.However Nicola Sturgeon is expected to reveal her partys \"next steps\" in its determination to hold a second referendum in the Scottish Parliament this Wednesday.Mr Blackford said the SNP would embark on \"a broad-based campaign\" to mobilise public opinion for indyref.\"It is completely untenable and unsustainable for Boris Johnson and his Tory government to stand in the way of the democratic will of the people of Scotland.ldquoItrsquos now crystal clear that Scotland needs the full powers of independence so Scotland can take its place alongside other independent European nations, rather than being dictated to by a Tory government with no mandate to govern in Scotland.\": Euan McColm: SNP losing their grip on lsquosafe handsrsquo reputationHe said the SNP would be working with civic Scotland and EU leaders in a bid to make sure a second independence referendum takes place this year. \"We have to mobilise public opinion.

That doesn#t mean the isles should do nothing, it means they should look at it in the context of the whole, and what represents value for public money.The #net zero # target proposed by infrastructure director Smith can only be achievedthe Viking Energy wind farm and its associated subsea cable link are installed. The council has no power to deliver that, rendering the #net zero # an unrealistic target which the council would be extremely foolish to adopt.God help us allthese windfarm supporters are called upon to look at climate change.Planting trees   They are planting turbines # great carbon savers those!Wind power , tidal forces , 🌞 sunshine —- I’m all in favour of them.

If a situation occurs outside anticipated parameters then electronic control can be useless. Aircraft have landed in the wrong place and landed unexpectedly at Sumburgh. In such circumstance everyone is safer when the situation is within view of a live controller in the airport tower. Such a lookout may also assist aircraft in dficulties, and react tovandalism and other hazardous outbreaks.They should do away with all that glass windows in the control tower as well as all the windows in control towers all over the world as they are clearly not needed. All can be done by looking at a computer screen.Any body with any sense knows there is no requirement to look in the sky, or on the runway or at the weather to see for yourself what is going on.If HIAL are determined to go ahead with this, perhaps there should be a #trial# period, of say at least a minimum of one year.Instead of just installing all the cameras and whatever other gubbins is supposed to make this work, feeding it down the phone line and hoping for the best. Why not pull down the blinds in the tower here and give the local controllers the same monitor screens to look at as they#re intending to use remotely to operate from instead. Meanwhile, also send the data to Inverness, and have them monitor and log on how many occasions and for what duration the data received is either interrupted or of inadequate quality.If the system is as resilient as HIAL claim, they have nothing to worry about or hide, the local controllers will have no complaints about using monitors instead of looking out the window, there will have been no data interruptions to Inverness, and any deterioration in data quality will have been minimal. However,serious shortcomings are evident, a controller only needs to raise the blind to regain actual vision and immediately rescue a situation.Bosses say their communications system has been affected, and that engineers are on the scene working to remedy the situation.# Well, that#s OK then.

This is just before my time but this song from the  ‘Let it Be’ album is my pick from many contenders.Number three is Love Affair – Everlasting Love. “This is my earliest memory from the  pop classic. “The remake of a ‘ hit for Robert Knight sung by the wonderful Steve Ellis.” The number four spot is reserved for ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’.“Coming up to its th anniversary, my constant favourite song of all time by Simon and Garfunkelis Bridge Over Troubled Waters.” Number five goes to Sam Cooke with ‘Bring it On Home to Me’“What top  couldn’t contain this amazing singer and composer who contributed to the success of Aretha, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Al Green.” Number six belongs to a Pink Floyd classic.“Probably in the mid ’s my favourite group was Pink Floyd. It was during this period that I began to collect albums.“Dark Side Of The Moon being my first Floyd purchase, however my pick is ‘Wish You Were Here’ off their ‘ album of the same name.”Seventh spot goes to The Eagles. “Sticking my mid ’s periodof music and my infatuation with The Eagles.“I rather quickly acquired their early albums ‘Desperado On The Border One Of These Nights’, however my selection is ‘The Last Resort’ off their th studio album Hotel Calornia.” For eighth spot, Vincent stays with The Eagles.“I’m still in my teenage years and sticking with the Eagles theme, although I’ve moved sideways to select an album I listened to nightly for a couple of years from Jackson Browne.“It was his fourth album and I’ve picked the title track, which is the wonderful ‘The Pretender’. As the list draws to a close, Vincent says: “Running out of room as I juggle with The Four Tops, The Jam, Steely Dan, Stevie, Wonder, Elvis Costello, Al Green, Spencer Davis, The Rolling Stones, George Harrison and OMD.“But I have to stick with my memory theme and at number nine I’ve gone with ‘Supertramp’ which I overplayed at university.“Mainly Crime Of The Century and Breakfast In America and Crisis What Crisis.“My selection is from the latter album and I’ve gone for A Soap Box Opera, it’s orchestral feel just does it to me.”For the last place on his top ten list, Vincent has included a track from the legendary Bruce Springsteen.“I needed Bruce Springsteen in here.“Although how do I pick just one track  Born To Run, The River Nebraska, Born In The USA, The Rising “Again sticking with nostalgia and being a romantic I’ve picked the  ‘Dancing In The Dark’ because it was the year I married Catherine and she’s had to put up with my music ever since!”It’s often hard to think of your favourite  tracks!

While he still enjoys the banter over the counter on a daily basis, hes made himself a local social media personality with his popular posts ranging from the daily headlines to his chatter sparking reminiscences about the confectionery of yesteryear. Editor Des Blackadder sat down with Eugene this week to hear just some of the stories he has to tell after four decades in his Broughshane Street shop.You could say that Eugene Diamond got his start in the newspaper industry and hes been associated with it for most of his adult le.Born in the late s in a long demolished row of mill workers cottages in James Street in Harryville, Eugene is one of nine children - three girls and six boys. Which must have been a tight fit in the James Street days.I was a baby when the family got a move to the houses in the Demesne Estate, just across the Braid River from Harryville. If you ask me I would say it was perfect place to grow up .. we had the ruins of a castle literally at the top of our estate and a forest pretty much on our doorstep!The neighbours were great people and there were lots of children growing up in the Demesne at the time. We used to have great fun making huts up in the woods - which we called the forest - just beside the old Intermediate School site. One of my best memories is making a hut under the pedestrian bridge over the Braid which led to the Ballykeel One estate - we could hear the people walking across above our heads and we thought we were some boys because they didnt know we were there! Innocent days indeed, laughs Eugene.There was no easy pocket money in those days so Eugene had to earn his by delivering newspapers around the sprawling Ballykeel Two estate which had been constructed in the late s.That was my first job in the newspaper business, recalls Eugene. I got the job with the late Tam Johnston who had premises at what used to be known as the Ballykeel One shops. He was a gentleman and his shop will be well remembered by the older generation around Ballykeel and Harryville.Having attended St Patricks High School, Eugenes first real job took him to the Murphys Bottling Plant which was sited just off Railway Street in Harryville.Always on the look out for an extra few quid, Eugene took on a weekend job serving in a clothes shop in the centre of Ballymena.That was me into the retail sector - and it was a great time to be in the clothing trade. A guy called Brian Close owned the shop which was called In-Gear. It was just at the corner of Bryan Street and Church Street - the same building occupied until recently by David Bellingham.Things went well and he offered me the post of manager so I left Murphys for good.It was an era of glam rock, outrageous stars and some outright fashion disasters.Top of the Pops more or less set the style. When the Bay City Rollers hit the heights their tartan striped half mast trousers and skinny college style jumpers were huge sellers especially with the girls.Most guys round Ballymena were pretty much content with a pair of jeans, a gingham shirt and a Shetland wool jumper. Younger lads wore a lot of Wrangler denim known locally as the Wrangler suit of jacket and skinner half mast jeans.I remember the night that David Essex appeared on Top of the Pops wearing a grandad shirt - the next day there was a huge demand for the style, we couldnt get enough of them!Bryan Ferry more or less brought the elegant suit back into fashion when he and Roxy Music made a comeback just after the punk era had faded. Guys all wanted the double-breasted suit with turn-up trousers at the time, he recalls.Eugene chuckles when I ask him about the fashion disasters he encountered.I sold an awful lot of velvet jackets at a time, he recalls. Black, blue, bottle green. They were very popular but I bet the guys who bought them wonder why when they look back.Then there was the parallel suit - I can remember the favourite colour was electric blue. Basically it was a sports coat worn with matching extra width trousers. You could have sailed the Atlantic with themyoud nailed them to a mast!But denim was, without doubt, the major seller in Ballymena and a controversial advert for one particular brand meant that Eugene found himself in the eye of a publicity storm which made headlines far and wide.In those days dferent shops were linked to a certain brand - for example Sam of Sams Boutique had what was effectively the Wrangler dealershipI remember. Edwin Maternaghan was another big name in fashion retailing locally and he had Brutus.By now the name of In-Gear had been changed to Bananas Boutique and we were selling Easy Jeans and a new product called Jesus Jeans.They had a full colour poster of a well-proportioned lady squeezed into a pair of Jesus Jeans with the slogan He who loves me, follows me. We put it up in the window and it was a marmite job - people either loved it or hated it! One religious group based out in the country started a petition about it so we started a counter petition in the shop.It was the time when Ballymena couldnt appear in a news story without the words Bible Belt being added on - around the same time you had the ELO showgrounds story making headlines too.While Eugene enjoyed the fun times at Bananas, he can well remember one of Ballymenas worst days of devastation during the troubles when Church Street was blown to smithereens by an IRA bomb.It was on Friday, May ,  and I remember I was chatting to a friend outside the shop when a police car raced up and an officer told us to clear the area because there was a bomb in a post office van parked in the street. I had got round to Wellington Street and was talking to my good friend journalist Lyle McMullan.I said to him theres a story for you and because there were so many bomb hoaxes in those days he replied onlyit goes off.With that the lower end of Church Street just lted. Ive never felt or seen anything like it before or since. It was a scene of utter devastation which people who lived through it will never forget. One of my vivid memories is how dficult it was to get re-opened - the shop had very distinctive rounded windows and it took a long time to get new glass  made by Pilkingtons. And of course a lot of people will remember the bomb damage sales which took place in the aftermath.When Bananas closed its doors in , Eugene reckoned it was time for a change of direction and when he came across a small shop for rent in Upper Broughshane Street he decided to take the plunge. It was called the First and last because it was the first shop on the way into town and, coversely, the last as you were going out!I had started off delivering papers as a wee boy and now I found myself in behind the counter of a paper shop, he said.”My first rent payment was pound a week.”Forty years later hes still loving the job - despite a horrying early .am start!Sure its only seven days a week, laughs Eugene.In those  years, Eugene has witnessed the high points of the newspaper market when titles like News of the World sold by the barrow load.You couldnt explain to todays generation just how huge the NOTW actually was. People might have bought the quality Sundays but they also bought the NOTW eventhey did tuck it inside the Sunday Times! Of course they were caught out in some abysmal practices and that cant be forgiven but they did break some enormously important stories too. I still have some NOTW publicity material on a side wall of the shop. It may well be the last such material still on display in Britain but I keep it there to remind of just how big the newspaper print industry was at the time.But selling papers was only part of Eugenes role and he was a past master at stirring up some publicity out of all proportion to the size of his tiny shop.Back in the early s I took a punt on getting my own Ballymena Rock made up by a firm in Newry. People thought I had lost the plot because everyone associated rock with seaside resorts and not a town like Ballymena. Thankfully local people loved the idea and I had a great sale on it. Quite a few bars were sent overseas too, he laughs.The ieties of sweets and chocolate bars Eugene has sold down through the years is staggering.In fact, Ive come to the conclusion that people here have the sweetest tooth in the world! If you want to start a debate in Ballymena all you have to do is ask someone what their favourite sweet of all time was.Im a diabetic so I dont do many sweets but I have a good knowledge of wnhat the public wants and to this day people will travel from all over the country to buy a certain brand of toffee or an old style boiled sweet which I stock. Sweets especially are memory jerkers and they have tremendous nostalgia value. If it gets people talking and laughing sure its a good thing. How many times have I heard stories about someone losing a filling to the old Rileys Toffee Rolls  And yet they still came back for more!And does he have a personal favourite Cinnamon Lozenges all the way, he says. As far as I know they are more or less an Irish-only sweet because people come in all the time and take away a few bags full to friends and family in other parts of the world.Talking about local flavours, Eugene says he still has regulars who come specically for the bottled minerals.You would not believe the number of people who still swear by Kali water! And the younger generation will have absolutely no idea wnat Kali Water is but older people will probably be remembering the day they took a drink of it by mistake.If digital technology is our pathway to the future then it is a time machine which works both ways and Eugenes nostalgia posts about old sweets on social media have been delighting the local public for the past few years.As one who was steeped in newspapers I was a latecomer to twitter and facebook but time waits for no man so I decided to embrace it. To be honest Ive had some great fun thanks to social media. People love the old pictures of products and just love to tell you their stories of why they loved a particular brand more than others, says Eugene.The recognition by the National Lottery reflects sales which have raised more than pound. million for good causes down through the years. As one of the last old style newsagents the award is well deserved and theextends its best wishes to Eugene as he embarks on his st year in the trade.

I want to make sure the Assembly reflects the new opportunity we have and have said to members both publicly and privately that I have to try and set a standard here of respecting everybody no matter who is in that chamber, they are all equal. The people who vote for them are equal. It’s about respect at the end of the day and I have to earn that as well.”The West Belfast MLA said that his take on the dynamics of the new ing Assembly going forward is that “it’s very important that it rises to occasion”. Having met with British Prime Minister Boris Johnston, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney, Mr Maskey said that both governments need to “respect that as well”. “We’ve got to respect political dference and we have to manage those,” he said. “I had very constructive engagements with them on Monday, obviously the substance of their visits was dealt with by the Executive.”Impartiality in his role as Speaker is a core element of the post, he said.“I had been pushing very hard on securing the funding that was announcement by the Department for Education for West Belfast schools. When it was announced about St John the Baptist I couldn’t even comment on it as I was in the ‘chair’ and that is the type of thing that your constituency needs to see a result on. There are little restrictions in this role but I will try to manage them."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"andytown ahead of schedule","story":"THE new Andersonstown Leisure Centre is set to open to the public in April, it has been revealed.Speaking at the official opening of the Brook Leisure Centre in Twinbrook, Cllr Brian Kingston, Chair of Belfast City Council’s Strategic, Policy and Resources Committee, said the redevelopment project was “ahead of schedule”.He said: “West Belfast has more to look forward to later this year with the opening of the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre, scheduled to open in April.“Herron Brotherstold me they are ahead of schedule.“Both Brook and Andersonstown Leisure Centres will completely transform leisure opportunities and active living access in West Belfast.”The new £ million state-of-the-art facility on the Andersonstown Road will focus largely on water-based family fun, with the newly installed water slides having been visible for months.The centre will also offer a range of dry facilities including a -station fitness suite, exercise and spin studio, café, multi-purpose room and two outdoor G five-a-side pitches."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"best of traditional irish music for belfast","story":"THE Waterfront Hall is set to host the  Gradam Ceoil TG music awards, with globally renowned quintet Beoga playing live at the internationally acclaimed event.Trad sensation Beoga, who collaborated with Ed Sheeran for his  chart topping hit ‘Galway Girl’ will take to the stage, for what is set to be the biggest Gradam Ceoil to date.Gradam Ceoil is the premier annual traditional music awards, with this year’s event set to be televised live on TG and available to stream on BBC iPlayer live from Belfast on Sunday February  thanks to support from Northern Ireland Screen’s Irish Language Broadcast Fund.The band are looking forward to their upcoming performance in Belfast.“We are delighted to be involved in the rdannual Gradam Ceoil TG traditional music awards celebration.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mclaughlin pays tribute to reds second half hunger","story":"CLIFTONVILLE boss Paddy McLaughlin paid tribute to his side’s second-half effort in their dramatic injury-time County Antrim Shield comeback win against Ballymena. The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"register now for the craic 10k st","story":"BELFAST’S First Citizen was onhand to officially launch the annual SPAR Craic K.Set to kick-start St Patrick’s Day celebrations on March , thousands of runners are set to take part in the urban run which is celebrating its sixth year.Lord Mayor Danny Baker told the Andersonstown News that he will counting down the race as runners go through their paces.“I will be starting the race and as much as I would love to take part I have a sore knee at the minute and that’s my excuse,” he laughed. “This is a huge event for the city and I’m delighted that a portion of the funds raised will go towards Marie Curie cancer charity.

Speaking to the BBCs Sunday Politics programme, Lord Trimble spoke about their visit to the families of Philip Allen and Damien Trainor - one a Protestant, one a Catholic - who were gunned down in a Co Armagh pub. The two friends were shot dead by the LVF more than twenty years ago in whats been described as one of the most sickening attacks of the Troubles. The SDLPs Mr Mallon and former UUP leader Lord Trimble visited their families in a powerful display of unity at the time. \"Seamus had come down from Markethill and I had come from Lisburn,\" Lord Trimble recalled. \"I came to the house of one of the victims and Seamus was there. My close protection officers were ushering me towards the car and Seamus said why dont we walk through the village and I said yes.\"Lord Trimble said the pair took their time walking through the village of Poyntzpass in March  so that they would be seen talking to each other. \"There are a number of people who told me after the event that when they saw that, they realised there was a possibility of things working. Up until then, politics in Northern Ireland hadnt worked and hadnt delivered. \"But now, people saw something which indicated maybe this time its going to be dferent, and of course it was.\"Speaking about when he and Mr Mallon first started working as First and Deputy First Minister, Lord Trimble said they were in a position of having to implement the Good Friday Agreement, which was signed that year. \"None of us had run anything before. The first few months were dficult but we very quickly developed a way of handling the issues and we worked closely together over a signicant period of time.\"When asked about their personal relationship outside of politics, Lord Trimble said he and Mr Mallon had to trust each other in order to work together. \"Theres no point in continually scoring points, youve got to actually work with the people who are there and work together to succeed.\"We had to get things done and that meant we had a working relationship and that means you can trust the other person and you have some idea of what the other person would want.\"He described Mr Mallon as someone who understood unionists and unionism. \"We knew his neighbours and he was friends with his neighbours and he had therefore a better view of things. \"Some nationalists dont have any understanding of unionism at all, Seamus was not one of them.\"Speaking of his last visit to Mr Mallon in Markethill, Co Armagh last week, he said: \"It was important to him and it was important to me too. When I left last Friday, I said I would come back next week but I didnt, because time ran out.\" On the same programme, SDLP leader and MP Colum Eastwood said Mr Mallon rejected violence all his le. \"He stood against it in a very dficult way during a very dficult time. He did it against the forces of the state and he did it against paramilitarism and he did it without a gun in his hand, thats a brave and a dficult thing to do. \"When people wonder how he managed that, criticising the RUC and the UDR on one hand and going to the funeral of an RUC officer in the other, hes just telling the truth in that space, hes just saying violence is wrong, what the state and the paramilitaries were doing was also wrong and hes going to call it out, and he did call it out,\" he said. \"He was respected because he was unafraid and undeterred, he wasnt going to be put off by anybody and thats a real and a special kind of bravery.\"The former SDLP deputy leader died at home in the care of his family following a period of illness.His remains will repose at his late home until removal on Monday for Requiem Mass at midday in St James Church in Mullaghbrack.

Nationally, motorists currently have to wait an average of  minutes to be spotted, and a further  minutes before they are rescued.It also said that dynamic hard shoulders – which sometimes act as hard shoulder but can be opened as traffic lanes – will be scrapped.The Department for Transport said a review into smart motorways announced in October was still ongoing.Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps told BBC Panorama’s Britain’s Killer Motorway  programme: “We absolutely have to have these as safe or safer as regular motorways or we shouldn’t have them at all.”Research from the AA found that only % of more than , people questioned feel relaxed or safe driving on a smart motorway.In addition, just % think that smart motorways are as safe as traditional motorways."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/a469a/38891653.ece/AUTOCROP/w620h342/Scotland-protestors-2.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon heckled over snps ira links in scottish parliament","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We had to go to Pennyburn. googletag.cmd.push  Derek McCauley, founder member of Shantallow Community Centre. Photo - Deirdre Heaney, nwpresspics  The move was a big culture shock.I saw a very urgent need to get an organisation together to improve the situation.I felt what was needed was a tenants association.The seeds of the Shantallow Tenants Association were sown when the residents began organising bus runs to Moville and Malin.It was a great opportunity for neighbours to get to know each other and there was a general consensus that more should be done for the young families in the area.In , just before the outbreak of the Troubles, Mr McCauley wrote  to the Belfastasking for help as he knew there were a lot of tenants associations in the Greater Belfast area.Groups from across the North advised him how to go about setting up a tenants association.The Highfield Tenants, Association, Amalgamated Corporation Tenants Asso- ciation, Tullycarnet Tenants Association, Lyne Social Club in Larne, North Belfast Tenants Association and the National Federation of Tenants Associations all wrote to me.I received lots of replies and they supplied me very useful advice.Most of these associations were political and non sectarian and I still have those letters.The main theme of these letters was use your politicians, but dont let them use you.The first meeting was held in a small gun club in the area by founder members, Danny Cooley, Tom Doherty, Sally Fleming and Mr McCauley.Mr McCauley was elected as chairman and Mr Cooley was elected as treasurer and it quickly became clear a community centre was needed.We put a questionnaire around the estate asking would they like a centre and what they would like to see in it and we got a great response.The association met with the Housing Trust  and made their case.We met with a lady called Miss MCCullough. She was a great help to us and I think we struck a chord with her, said Mr McCauley.The reason we were successful was because we were non political and non sectarian.When we went to ask for anything we asked politely and we didnt demand it.The Shantallow Community Centre was the first of its type to be built in the city and cost pound,.Its was only supposed to last  years, said Mr McCauley.The centre was soon a hive of activity and people came from across the city to use it.We had a childrens play group, handicraft classes, Irish dancing classes, piano lessons, a childrens disco and a youth disco on a Saturday night.It was the only disco of its kind in the city at that time we had young people coming from Newbuildings and the foot of Bishop Street for that.You would find them standing outside after and they had no way of getting home, so I would have given them a lt in my big yellow Zephyr.Everyone remembers the Zephyr. If I go to a wake in Shantallow people say to me do you still have that big yellow car The list of activities at the centre continued to grow with gymnastics, rollerskating, indoor bowls and bingo.In  they held a cross community festival for all the churches in the area.It was a good time, said Mr McCauley.It was all young families living in the area and on the summer days you would have thought there was a swarm of bees out on the back square but it would just have been all the children.That was before phones and Playstations.The work of the centre stretched far outside its doors with bus runs, dinner dances, outdoor festivals, sports competitions and luncheon clubs.Mr McCauley dedicated countless hours to it, but he said none of it would have been possible without the support of his we, Rita, who sadly passed away two years ago.She was the most important person, he said.We had six children and she had to rear them all.Mr McCauley eventually retired from the Tenants Association in , but not before he shared his knowledge with community groups across the city. A long list of people gave many volunteer hours to the Shantallow Tenants Association and Community Centre.I would like to wish all future communities the success we had and give a special thanks to all those people who made it so successful. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He was always destined for success. His mother Catriona is an Ulster and All-Ireland champions camogie player, before moving into coaching where titles also streamed in her direction. Garys father Ronnie and grandfather George are steeped in motorbikes. On a dferent tangent, his sister Lara is both a champion gymnast and trampolinist. Sport simply runs in the family. For the  year-old St Patricks Maghera pupil, he has excelled in the world of motorsport despite only going into his third season in the saddle. Gary has competed on the Irish minibike circuit since its inception in , finishing second in the junior class, before graduating to the senior ranks last season. googletag.cmd.push In recent weeks, he was awarded the prestigious David Wood scholarship which the Motorcycle Union of Ireland awards to its most promising rider. It was won for the first time in  by Lee Johnston, winner of the last seasons Junior Isle of Man TT winner. He also took on the role of IMC Youth Ambassador – to act as a role-model for our younger members. “During this time Gary has shown maturity beyond his years, building up a great rapport with our Junior Members and his peers,” commented IMC Chairman Mark Boyd. “In addition to his abilities as a competitor, his positive attitude in success or defeat coupled with the clear commitment shown by both Gary and his family to his budding racing career bode well for his future. googletag.cmd.push “As Chairman of The Irish Minibike Championship I am privileged to recommend Gary for inclusion in the  BTC and wish him every success with the selection process.” His mothers reluctance stalled Garys career until just before his th birthday but she is now fully behind him since his early short circuit days. In , he progressed to the IMC Senior Open and Ulster Superbike Moto Championship. “Last year he was doing pit bikes with young kids but this year he went on to the short circuits and he was racing against adults, when he won the Moto championship,” Catriona said. “Now he is hoping to go to the British Superbikes on a Moto as well.” “As a rookie in the USBK Moto Championship, against some very experienced and older riders I came away with the title USBK Moto Champion ,” Gary outlined in his CV, which has been compiled with the view to attracting sponsorship for this season and a shot at the Moto class. The costings for next season could amount to over poundk, including a pound, Honda NSFR bike, entry fees and travel. “At the end of next year my aim is to make a wildcard into the Spanish Championship with my future dream to ride in the World Championships,” Gary added. He grew up watching and supporting both his father and grandfather in action on both the circuits and roads. It was no surprise to see him emerge from their shadows. His family helped him raise the funds for a trip to Donnington to compete in a round of the British Superbikes to help gather invaluable experience and a taste of what  could bring. MCUI Trainer and respected journalist and photographer Baylon McCaughey was full of praise for Gary. “Despite the cold and wet weather Gary, despite having only one season of tarmac racing under his belt in Pit Bike Racing, showed great enthusiasm and certainly was not afraid to ask questions,” he said. “After each session, he would enquire,he was doing the correct thing or not, and listened to advice given. “With plans to compete in the British Championships, I know this lad has the correct approach to his racing, his manners off the track, and competitiveness on the track, will certainly help him to achieve his goals.” Talent, with an attitude to match. Perhaps the greatest combination. If the next two years follow his meteoric rise since , Gary Scott is destined for greatness. Remember the name.

Rory Gallaghers side had two chances to win the game in stoppage time. First Shane Quinn blocked down Carlus McWilliams left-footed shot and Quinns interception stopped Brendan Rogers run in the last attack of the game. In the end, a share of the spoils was as much as Derry could hope for. Barring Shane McGuigans th minute goal, to level the game, they lacked the cutting edge to put Leitrim away. All too often, they coughed up possession when on the attack. googletag.cmd.push Watch: Its relief not to be beat - @Doiregaa boss Rory Gallagher #AllianzLeagues pic kdBqick — County Derry Post January ,     Derry had the breeze but registered two wides and dropped two efforts short before Ciaran McFaul opened the scoring in the eighth minute. The visitors were having great joy on the counter attack and went - up and deservedly so. Keith Beirne and Shane Moran were causing bother for Derrys defence. In the th minute it got worse for Derry. Goalkeeper Odhraacuten Lynch punched Domhnaill Flynns diagonal cross down into the path of Cillian McGloin, who jinked inside before roofing a shot to the net. Emmett Bradley and Ryan Bell hit points as Derry recovered but anytime they turned over the ball, Leitrim punished them on the break. googletag.cmd.push Liam McGoldrick and Chrissy McKaigue began to get to grips in defence and Derry began to gain confidence. Ciaran McFaul and Gavin ONeill were influential and started to go at Leitrim. ONeill passed to Emmett Bradley who hit a blockbuster to the top corner in the nd minute and Derry were within a point Eoghan Duffy, who had an earlier half-chance for goal saved, tied the game before skipper McKaigue put Derry - to - ahead at the break. Terry Hylands men, who bounced back from a hammering to Roscommon in the FBD league, hit the first four points of the second-half. They penned Derry into their own half and Domhnaill Flynns long-range effort was a sign of intent, before three Keith Beirne points put them in the driving seat. Just when Derry needed a spark, Emmett Bradley won a kick-out on the wing. Seconds later, when Ciaran McFauls high ball dropped in round the house, it was punched clear by goalkeeper Diarmuid McKiernan but Ryan Bell fed McGuigan who drilled to the net. Still it was Leitrim who got themselves back in front and looked the likely winners. With a minute to go, league debutant Ben McCarron fired over a beauty before McFaul levelled the game. Derry must pick up the pieces ahead of a trip to Paacuteirc Esler next Saturday to play Down managed by former Oakleaf selector Paddy Tally.

Lyndon Stephens died that morning after battling stoically against illness. His record label, Quiet Arch, was already planning to go into hiatus due to his illness and had planned a farewell gig in the Belfast Empire for that very evening. As fate would have it, it became his wake. I am a firm believer in the human spirit being how people remember you and I prefer to gather other people’s memories for things like this. Ryan Vail: “The man that gave me a career in music, toured me around the world, put me on tv, put me on radio, made me a headline festival artist, got me sound tracking, got me remixing, got me producing, got me talking on some of the most important industry , got me the most prestigious funding awards my manager, friend, label partnerLyndon Stephens.“I was his very first signing nine years ago and stayed with him the whole time. We released together, toured together started labels together, found acts together and had hours of phone calls together daily. “To be honest it’s been so so dficult to comprehend. Im really grateful for the memories we shared together.“RIP Lyndon, thank you for changing my le”Ciaran Lavery: “I first met Lyndon Stephens at Output, Belfast. He didn’t know me or owe me anything but kept putting me forward to talk to the local press that were at the event. “After the show, he askedI’d like to chat to him about working together. “Over the course of the next five years we broke down so many walls and glass ceilings. We spoke on the phone three for four times a day every day. I could call him at ungodly hours and he always answered, he was always there, Lyndon loved to talk. He was an incredible human being with a wonderful family and friends circle. “I know that when any friend musician needed advice of funding I pointed them towards Lyndon andhe had the time, he gave it willingly. I have an incredible amount of memories. I will miss my old friend so dearly, but in truth, I am truly blessed to have met Lyndon Stephens”.Francesca O’Connor, from Quiet Arch ,said “Lyndon Stephens, a man who wanted to make a genuine dference to this world, give the underdogs a  to shine and to show the world the incredible talent coming out of Northern Ireland. “He set up an artist management company, Champion Sound Music and record label, Quiet Arch, to put Northern Ireland artists on the international stage. I will forever be grateful to him for hiring me as a trainee artist manager . years ago. “As a young female with little experience but an eagerness to learn, he gave me a chance. I can only take inspiration from his creativity, decisiveness, determination and unwavering passion to succeed to carry on what he started. “Not long ago, he sent me the poem Go All The Way by Charles Bukowski and I cant think of a better way to describe his tenacious spirit.” She concluded: A loving husband, father, sister and friend, Lyndon is undoubtedly one in a million and will never be forgotten”.Ben Magee, also of Quiet Arch said “Lyndon’s biggest strength, and of those he had many, was when he believed in you, you knew about it. He was never one to shower you with praise, butyou had Lyndon in your corner, he made you feel like you could conquer the world. “A profound, hilarious inidual who was always one step ahead of everyone  in the room, Lyndon never spent a second of his le saying goodbye. “He always had his eyes fixed squarely on the horizon, eyebrows raised, a mad cackle dancing on the corner of his mouth. He was a mentor, a confidant, an always open ear and a friend. And I will miss him dearly.”My memories of Lyndon are very similar to Ciaran’s and probably most other people’s. he was always willing to help and preferred to talk over the other means of communication. If I ever went off the deep end with one of my rants at the music scene here Lyndon would message me quickly to calmly explain how things worked and how I might be right but mostly how I was wrong. It always began with a text message but was always swtly abandoned in favour of a chat. Always knowledgeable and always reasonable I will truly miss the advice and am forever grateful for the counsel. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He said: “Over recent months, we have been reporting street lighting faults on an almost daily basis in every part of my constituency. The response has sadly been that due to budgetary constraints, the Department are only providing a limited street lighting repair service with priority repairs focused on emergency repairs, group outages and all day burners, followed by single light defects.”“This is alarming. Adequate street lighting is imperative to provide safe streets, deter crime and anti-social behaviour and crucially provides elderly residents with security and safety and the assurance that they are not isolated and alone. In some areas a single light can be % of the lighting in a cul-de-sac, so the fact that one light is out makes a real dference.”“Having raised the issue with the Divisional Office, I was advised this was due to budgetary constraints and until additional funds became available, only a limited repair service would be possible. I subsequently sought an intervention from the Permanent Secretary and sought details as to the extent of the problem.”“To my astonishment, the Department have now confirmed that almost , lights are out at present across the North. This is unacceptable and is a direct result of budget cuts. Last year the Street lighting budget was pound.m and it has been slashed by over a third to pound.m. Do people really think that when you strip out vital financial and human resources from a basic service that it will have no impact ”The SDLP Assemblyman added: This needs to be urgently addressed. I will continue to liaise with Departmental officials to press for action.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is focussing on four constituencies - Cavan, Wexford, Donegal and the retention of the Meath West seat. ,However, Cllr McCloskey said she felt it was important to stand in Sligo Leitrim. Aontuacute is a fledgling political party, she said. We have a group of very committed activists in Sligo who were very keen for someone to stand. The constituency takes in all of counties Sligo and Leitrim, part of southern Donegal and part of northern Roscommon.” googletag.cmd.push  Peter Casey Cllr McCloskey said the party had a “mountain to climb” with just over two weeks to polling day on  February but she was “looking forward to the challenge.” Cllr McCloskey claimed the party had gained supporters from across the political spectrum, including from the unionist community. Aontuacute was established last year after Peadar Toacuteibiacuten left Sinn Feacutein. He claimed he had been ostracised from the party because of his opposition to abortion. Several high-profile former Sinn Feacutein members, including Francie and Anne Brolly, later joined the party. Aontuacute claimed three seats in last years local elections in the Republic.If elected, Cllr McCloskey would be expected to stand down from her seat on Derry City and Strabane District Council.Meanwhile, former Presidential candidate Peter Casey this week revealed his intention to stand as a General Election candidate in Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s constituency.Mr Casey, who lives in Greencastle in Inishowen, had already filed papers to stand in Donegal, revealed he nominated himself to stand in Dublin West.The businessman finished second behind Michael D Higgins in the  Presidential race, when he drew controversy over his remarks about the Travelling community.He also unsuccessfully stood for European Parliament in the Midlands-North West constituency last year. Announcing his candidacy, Mr Casey said he was standing in the Dublin constituency to give people an opportunity to register “an obvious protest vote” against Varadkar.“The Taoiseach’s string of failures is recorded for all to see,” he said.“There’s the swing-gate and fobgate scandals, the National Children’s Hospital disgrace, the broadband spending debacle, the unprecedented crises in health and housing – list goes on and people have had enough… “People are right to be angry and that’s why I’m giving them the opportunity to voice their anger directly by voting for me in Dublin West.”Speaking at the registration office, the -year-old said he believed Mr Varadkar was not fit to be Taoiseach, but said he would not canvas there, adding that his primary goal would be to represent the people of Donegal.As well as the Taoiseach, Mr Casey will face competition for the Dublin constituency’s four seats from outgoing TDs Joan Burton of Labour, Fianna Faacuteil’s Jack Chambers, and Solidarity-People Before Profit’s Ruth Coppinger.Others standing in the constituency include Fine Gael’s Emer Currie, Sinn Feacutein’s Paul Donnelly, the Green Party’s Roderic O’Gorman, Aengus Oacute Maolaacutein, Aontuacute’s Edward Mac Manus and independent candidates Stephen O’Loughlin and Sean O’Leary. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Speaking as the first phase of the scheme neared completion Kevin Campbell, development worker with the Triax Neighbourhood Management Team, said: “In the last few years it has become clear that there are increasing numbers of older residents in the Triax area who are experiencing problems maintaining the exterior of their homes or gardens, for whatever reason.” googletag.cmd.push “Recognising this, and working with Awards for All and other groups we have been able to design and fund a pilot programme of home assistance for older residents in three identied areas in the Triax area. This programme is obviously complementary to the ongoing work of the Triax Neighbourhood Management Team and helps us help harder to reach residents.” Mr Campbell continued: “The TNMT are delighted to be able to provide this assistance and in the next few months we will also be in the Iniscarn and Beechwood areas as this scheme rolls out. “As we work towards making the area a cleaner, safer and more welcoming place to live it is crucial we assist those who need assistance to make the dferences that matter to them. The Awards for All funded Home Assistance Programme is helping us to do that.” googletag.cmd.push Oakfield resident, Charles O’Donnell, who has helped roll out the scheme said: “Little did I realise when Kevin contacted me how the scheme would impact on iniduals within the Oakfield area. “After an initial assessment during which a multitude of homes were visited a list of properties which required urgent and essential work was drawn up. During the following two weeks nine of these received a iety of works from basic power washing, removal of large amounts of wasps and, in two particular cases extensive cutting back of hedges, brambles and trees.” “A particular highlight of strength of the scheme was the group of men who carried out the work. Good craic, kind, considerate, welcoming and extremely hard working are just a few words which describe the team.” Mr ODonnell concluded: “The residents and myself will be eternally grateful for their consideration and support. Sincere thanks to Donna, Kevin and the whole TRIAX team.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Rice Bowlclosed for a month so the owner could get married. But rather than put up a standard “closed” sign, a giant photo of a customer entering the takeaway was placed over the shopfront.  The owner – known only as Mr Chang – came up with the hilarious idea after an elderly neighbour said she didn’t feel safe without his customers about. Mr Chang, , ed from his honeymoon to discover a month’s-worth of very confused – and hungry – customers on his CCTV system. googletag.cmd.push So he decided to share the best of the clips on social media. The clips were captioned: “The award goes to the lady that tried to look through a window that is really not a window.” The series of funny clips show baffled customers scratching their heads as they try to gain entry to the shop. In one, a woman in a checked coat is seen attempting to push the fake door. After getting nowhere, she then attempts to peer through the  window and pushes her full weight against the wall. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This can help tackle both the obesity epidemic and improve childrenrsquos overall health and well-being.The Active School Travelprogramme which Sustrans delivers has successfully increased the number of pupils walking, cycling and scooting to school, with the charity explaining that it takes on  new schools each year.However, it says the programme needs to expand and provide more long-term support to school communities in order to turn around these statistics.In the   period, the number of children walking, cycling and scooting to school in the AST programme increased from % to % while, at the same time, the number of pupils being driven to school fell from % to %.Cllr Walker says he is ldquoall for getting more children to walk to school, but explained that in some parts of Down District, this simply isnrsquot possible as in many rural areas there are no footpaths. In addition, he said there are no dedicated cycle paths.ldquoI fully support the work of Sustrans and have worked with the charity on a number of schemes in my own area, he revealed.ldquoI recognise that the more children who walk to school, the less congestion there will be and fewer cars sitting in traffic queues pumping dangerous fumes into the atmosphere.Cllr Walker said mph zones have been introduced outside some local schools, calling for such schemes to be rolled out across all council areas.He added: ldquoWith the emphasis now on people taking more responsibility for their own health and getting fitter, encouraging children to walk to school when it is safe to do so will sew the seed of keeping healthy from an early age and this will stay with them for the rest of their lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Delay.jpg","title":"Delay for development meeting on Irish Street  ","story":"AN event designed to provide business owners in Downpatrick with an input into plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings has been delayed.Originally scheduled to take place before Christmas the meeting was delayed in the wake of the snap Westminster election, with hopes that it would go ahead this month.Now it has emerged that it could be February or March before what is being viewed as one of the most signicant town centre regeneration meetings ever to take place in the district takes place.A number of Downpatrick councillors were recently given the opportunity to view the inside of the former police base and the expansive grounds to the rear which will feature heavily in the proposed redevelopment scheme.The old police base enjoys protected status and therefore cannot be razed to the ground to pave the way for any new development. As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials have this week reaffirmed their commitment to work with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site, with the project being spearheaded by the Department of Communities.Council officials say that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what local people would like to see and what would work at this particular site.Officials insist that there is little point developing options which they think might work, with the forthcoming meeting with all stakeholders designed to secure by-in from them and develop a project that is likely to succeed.The planned meeting with all stakeholders will help shape a development brief inviting potential developers to come forward to transform the site and kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.In addition, the development brief will outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Local councillor Dermot Curran said the recent visit to the proposed Irish Street development site provided an insight into its size and development potential.He is backing the move to involve businesses and residents in helping shape the development brief for the site and hopes that the planned meeting at which they will be asked for their input can take place soon.ldquoWhat we are talking about is the biggest ever investment in Downpatrick town centre. We have to get this right as it has the potential to not only regenerate Irish Street, but the wider town centre by attracting increased footfall which will boost existing businesses, many of them locally owned, said Cllr Curran.ldquoIt is clear that having viewed the Irish Street site that it offers massive potential and can transform Downpatrick town centre and provide a major boost for existing businesses.Cllr Curran said he has spoken to a number of business people who are keen to have the date of the meeting with consultants confirmed so they can attend to help play their part in shaping the future development of a prominent town centre site.He added: ldquoPeople want to see progress on this crucially important development. Redeveloping the expansive Irish Street site can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment and will provide a boost for existing businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down senior footballers face tough opener  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS senior footballers head for Clonmel on Sunday more in hope than optimism to open their Division  Allianz League campaign against Tipperary.Paddy Tallyrsquos charges face a tough opening game as the Premier County, who were relegated from Division  last season, will be like a wounded animal and determined to bounce back into the leaguersquos second tier.The sides met last June at Pairc Esler when Down won an All-Ireland Qualier - to -. Pat Havern, Corey Quinn and Donal OrsquoHare did most of the scoring that day, but Tipperary will be a dferent proposition at the weekend.New Tipp manager David Power, who famously led the county minors to an All-Ireland title in , has an abundance of talent at his disposal, but he will have to without star player Michael Quinlivan.The Clonmel Commercials man has decided to go travelling for a year and his absence is a huge loss to Tipperaryrsquos attack and the countyrsquos bid to regain their status in the top flight ahead of next seasonrsquos championship changes.Promotion is also a must for Down as well, as they too have huge aspirations of avoiding competing in the All-Ireland second tier competition.Down have just emerged from an indferent McKenna Cup campaign.Wins over Fermanagh and Antrim were cast aside when Tallyrsquos team were given a reality check by Tyrone in the semi-finals.Mickey Hartersquos experimental side simply over-powered Down and had too much physicality all over the park.Hopefully, Down will have learned from that game, but second guessing Tallyrsquos team selection ahead of Sunday is a dficult job.Definitely missing Sundayrsquos game will be vice-captain Caolan Mooney, the one player in the camp who has the ability to stand out from the rest. His unavailability through injury is a severe blow to Tallyrsquos aspirationsJohn OrsquoHare and Marc Hynes shared the goalkeeping duties in the two McKenna Cup games, but Castlewellanrsquos Rory Burns is still considered as the county number one.Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins, Burrenrsquos Kevin McKernan and Warrenpointrsquos Ryan McAleenan could well man the full back berths with Annaclonersquos Brendan McArdle also in the frame.A knee injury for Saulrsquos Pierce Laverty, picked up against Tyrone, could rule him out of action, but Daniel Guinness could well fill in for him at right half back. Captain Darren OrsquoHagan seems to be favourite to start at centre half back with a mixture of Ross Carr, McArdle, Mayobridgersquos Shane Annett and Guinness flanking him.Midfield has been a bit of a problem for Down, but Loughinislandrsquos Jonny Flynn should start in this sector with either Liatroimrsquos Liam Middleton, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan, Carryduffrsquos Owen McCabe or Longstonersquos Conor Poland most likely to get the nod.The set of six forwards will come from Poland, McCabe, Corey Quinn, Barry OrsquoHagan, Conor Maginn, Pat Havern, Donal OrsquoHare, Brendan Gallen, Ciaran Harney, Liam Kerr and Ross McGarry.Regardless of who Tally starts with, Tipperary will be no pushovers and now under Powerrsquos management, they will be keen to impress.Michael OrsquoReilly, Liam Fahey, Bill Maher, Robbie Kiely, Jack Kennedy, Conor Sweeney and Liam Treacy all showed up well in Tipperaryrsquos recent McGrath Cup campaign and did enough, even without Quinlivan, to suggest that they will be a tough nut to crack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 22%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Rumours were re this week that it could be another ten years before the adoption of the poundm-plus scheme to provide a lsquoring roadrsquo in Downpatrick.Work on the scheme first started in the late sixties and, ironically, the Department of Environment is preparing to make a public announcement within the next two weeks on the route they want the road to take.But on Monday Downpatrick councillor Mr Eddie McGrady told a meeting of Down councillors that there were local rumours of another ten-year delay.Within the past  hours it has become obvious that the warning could take on realistic proportions.It seems clear that a wall of objections will be raised of the scheme and it could particularly take years to smooth out negotiations and pare the way for a pubic inquiry, which now looks inevitable.Mr McGradyrsquos warning came during a council discussion on a planning decision to refuse alterations and extensions to a dwelling in Saul Street, which is expected to be in the path of the new road.He drew the councilrsquos attention to a planning approval for squash courts in St Patrickrsquos Avenue mdash also likely to be in the path of the road mdash offering one explanation for the conflicting decisions.ldquoThere are rumours that planning permissions might be given in certain circumstances because it might be ten years before the road is implemented, he said.CROSSGAR mdash The st Crossgar Boys Brigade will represent Down Battalion in the Northern Ireland district finals of the squad drill competition in Omagh on Saturday.The Lissara boys qualied for the finals by wining the annual Down Battalion competition held at Banbridge on Monday night. Second was st Ballyroney, with st Raffrey finishing third.This is the most prestigious event in the Battalion calendar and a very high standard of drill was set by the locals, who have been practicing the movements for the past four months.Apart from the squad competition, there was also a squad commandant cup presented at Banbridge and Sgt M Cuffey, of Crossgar, was the winner.The overall competition was chaired by Mr D Partridge, Battalion president, assisted by Mr R Dickson, Battalion secretary.

They say they are simply removing mercury out of the rotating lens system and putting in a new ldquoinnovative mechanical bearing solution, insisting that the changes are not being driven by any

Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse continuing to provide an essential safety service for mariners as it has done since a light was first established in Killough in .During a public meeting last year to discuss the proposed changes at the lighthouse, CIL was urged by concerned residents and politicians to leave the lighthouse as it is and not to do anything to harm its heritage.There was also a warning that there would be ldquoructions at all levelsthe proposed changes were implemented, with several people pointing to the potential for the lighthouse to be transformed into a unique leading visitor attraction which would provide an economic boost for the area.Residents opposed to changes argue that Killough boasts the ldquofinest example of a lighthouse of its kind and that no one is in any doubt about the maritime history and heritage of St Johnrsquos Point and its uniqueness.Campaigners say that they are determined to protect the heritage of the lighthouse and suggest it is

potential to generate millions of pounds in tourism revenue.Typical activities in geoparks include the development of walking and cycling trails, training local people to act as guides, the provision of information signs and the development of visitor centres.Northern Irelandrsquos only other current geopark mdash the Marble Arch Caves which inhabits the rugged mountainous uplands and gentle rolling lowlands of counties Cavan and Fermanagh mdash contributes just over poundm to the economy in this area.Local council officials, who confirmed a pre-Christmas Recorder story that the formal bid for geopark status had been submitted, have revealed that an Area of Outstanding Natural Beautymanagement team for the three local areas has been created.Council officials say that they are continuing to work secure geopark status which is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism.But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious geopark designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with those behind the bid confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors in particular.But securing geopark status is not just about delivering financial benefit.Geoparks in other areas have empowered local communities, providing them with opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.If the local bid for geopark status for a huge swathe of land covering Strangford and Lecale, the Mournes and Ring of Gullion is successful, the international designation is expected to play a key role in helping transform the local economy.The geopark brand will use the geological heritage of the three areas to develop sustainable tourism that generates economic benefits, while providing recreational opportunities and increased awareness of the arearsquos natural assets, working with landowners, businesses and communities.The ultimate aim of a geopark is to enhance the economy and develop employment opportunities for the people who live there, but the global brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been

This year they donated a fantastic amount for the charities, said Raphael. ldquoI am delighted to see young people come on board to help others. They are a credit to their school and their families.Raphaelrsquos chance meeting with Martin, a homeless man living on the streets of Dublin whom he met during a visit to family members a number of years ago, was the catalyst for him to launch his annual appeal which has enjoyed tremendous community support.The photographerrsquos meeting with Martin underneath a railway bridge close to Pearse Street railway station had a profound impact on him, moving him to organise an appeal as soon as he ed home.ldquoThe sight of seeing Martin on Pearse Street back in  will be with me forever. To see homelessness on the rise across Ireland,north and south, means something is badly wrong. There doesnrsquot appear to be any political will to cure the problem. It there was, we would not have homelessness in a modern society. More needs to be done, immediately, said Raphael.Year on year the response to his appeal has increased and this year he will be looking for anyone interested in helping to get in touch to help with the collection, storage and distribution of donations.Raphael confirmed that he plans to launch his appeal for volunteers to join forces with him this October.ldquoI cannot begin to praise every single person who responded to my Christmas appeal. It was so overwhelming, he explained.ldquoAll I do is put the word out about my appeal and people come forward in great numbers to help. The response to the latest appeal was the biggest to date and I cannot thank people enough for their generosity and support.ldquoThe response from the public was truly unbelievable. I am particularly indebted to everyone, in particular, the staff and students at St Colmcillersquos High School.The annual appeal is particularly time-consuming for someone who runs his own business and that is why Raphael is hoping people will volunteer to help him in .ldquoEvery item that is donated has to be unpacked and checked to make sure it is okay to pass on. Then it has to be sorted, re-packed and stored until the time to deliver it comes. This takes up a lot of time and there is only so much one person can do, he explained.Raphael has also singled out the management and staff at Peter Fitzpatrick and Sons Estate Agents in Downpatrick for particular praise for allowing their Irish Street base to be used as a -off point for his appeal.ldquoThe business has been so supportive over the past number of years. I cannot thank them enough for all their help, he said.ldquoDePaul was over the moon with the items people donated and the fact that a signicant number of people took time out at Christmas to think of and help others is very humbling. If more people come forward to help me this year, together, we could do even more.In future Raphael hopes to deliver the majority of donations to more local charities and organisations. He said it only seems right that items collected are distributed locally so in future most of what he receives will go to local charities.He added: ldquoThe generosity and community spirit across the district is something to behold. All I do is announce details of the appeal and people across the community then donate in numbers.ldquoOnce the message gets out there, people are quick to respond and I am so grateful as are the organisations they are supporting.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves. The vast majority just wonrsquot be able to do this.ldquoIntroducing policy which isnrsquot fit for purpose could have severe consequences. The impact on consumers must be central to discussions on the future of heating, and cost and disruption minimisedsupport for climate change action is to be forthcoming.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This in turn benefits their schoolwork across the whole curriculum, not just in literacy.\"We are also grateful to the local businesses who generously donated the coffee shop vouchers to help make this happen.ldquoThe contributions of local businesses show once again what great community spirit we have here in Penarth!\"In total,  local businesses donated coffee shop vouchers.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.

Now, the aim is to grow that to £m, which includes a new office in Dublin to expand its market reach right across Ireland.“We are hoping to take that to £m in the next four years and we have opened an office in Dublin,” she told Ulster Business.“It’s an ambitious target, but we have grown year-on-year for the past nine years and have brought a lot of technology into the business and to our clients.”The client list reads like a who’s who of the giants of Northern Ireland industry, including poultry processor Moy Park, Almac and Devenish Nutrition. The firm has also looked after those on the Game of Thrones crew.“We have a strong track record of getting and maintaining good clients,” she says. “We are a new breed of travel management company. We want to make a dference in client businesses. “People, the human capital, is what the business is and making sure they are looked after while they travel is a big thing for us – doing it effectively, making sure they have the support,  .“I’ve been in travel for more than  years and I’m passionate about it. It has changed dramatically, with the rise of the smartphone.”That includes the development of booking tools for clients, but also looking ahead and building more advanced technology, incorporating articial intelligence and being able to personalise the experience for each traveller. Born in Belfast, Edel’s initial career trajectory looked set for university, but instead she wanted to go in to the world of work, and tackle the travel sector.“I went straight into the industry and I’m a great believer in le-long learning. I want to be the best version of me and to reach my potential,” she says. That includes working across dferent areas of the travel industry. But Edel says business travel “was always my love”.Edel is involved with the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Women in Business, as well as sitting on the CBI’s SME Council in London. She’s also just been named Businesswoman of the Year by Women in Business.And like many company founders, Edel hit the ground running with her own business as the world entered its worst recession in a generation. She was previously a director with a company for  years, before deciding to make the move and go it alone.“I made a business plan – I said to myself, I can do this, I know I can. I built a brilliant team around me, and almost  years later, here we are. It’s been hard work, but it’s enjoyable and I’m passionate about the Northern Ireland economy. I’m passionate about buying local.”As for Brexit, Edel says setting up the Dublin office was one was in which the firm was mitigating against any business concerns arising from Brexit.“It’s hard to plan when you don’t know. Business people are problem solvers,” she says. “Once we have a problem, we come up with a solution. But people are holding back on decisions. We did a complete analysis of our clients and they are down on last year. It completely filters down and there is a knock on effect and people are nervous.“A lot of our clients are exporters. If they are affected, everything from export documents, to the movement of goods and people – that willimpact.”Looking to the future and Edel’s ambitious £m turnover target she says leading the way in tech and being early adopters is helping to drive expansion.“We are looking out at what’s coming – some clients won’t work without technology, and we have tech bedded in. It’s tried and tested.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
