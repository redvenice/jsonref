The biggest thing on display is a collage Picasso made in the winter of 1937, of women at their toilet.At its centre squats the photographer and artist Dora Maar (who has just had a good show of her own work at Tate Modern). She is redly gasping, her dark eyes staring as two of Picasso’s other mistresses comb her hair and present a mirror, which seems to show not her reflection but the painter’s.The whole thing is composed of pieces of cut-out wallpaper it is a kind of domestic ‘Guernica’, his anti-war masterpiece that memorialised the bombing of the ancient Basque city during the Spanish Civil War.At the other end of the scale are torn and scratched tiny paper pieces, making knives and forks, dancers, masks and skulls, so small that even pressed between glass they seem to be barely there at all.Then there are his Cubist guitars, made out of small pieces of cloth, string, painted cardboard and newspaper beautiful tricks from scraps. At times, he can seem almost like a children’s entertainer, constantly turning one thing into something else.Towards the end of the show there is a remarkable film of Picasso drawing. He was working with new-fangled American felt pens, which so saturated the paper the coloured marks could be filmed in real time from the other side.The effect is that you see the drawing happening as his hand moves. It’s almost like watching his mind working. I found it entirely mesmerising.Then the show ends, as did Picasso’s life, with deliberately clumsy works full of an old man’s desperate erotic yearning during the swinging 60s, a million miles from the deft, swaggering late 19th century drawing with which it began. Overall, despite the humour, bright colour and occasional sentimental tributes, this is a dark show. Any proper representation of Picasso must be.Because, I suppose, all shows now must try to attract the widest possible audience, including children, there are little jokey notices aimed at the young. But the truth is, children ought to be kept well away from this show in particular and Picasso in general. There is too much grief and anger, too much rape, too much murder.So perhaps it is no great surprise that the mild-mannered British took a while to fall in love with the dark and provocative Spaniard. A famous story has the president of the Royal Academy, Sir Alfred Munnings, leaving the building where this show takes place in 1949, and asking Winston Churchill what he would do if he saw Picasso walking down Piccadilly in front of them.         Girl In A Hat With Her Hands Clasped, 1921. As ever with the good artist, even if you think you know the work from reproductions it’s worth coming to see for yourselfAccording to Munnings, Churchill — who disapproved of Picasso’s non-representional style and left-wing politics — replied: ‘Kick him up the arse, Alf.’ The former prime minister was embarrassed and angry about the anecdote, but it captures a little of the official hostility to Picasso, which lasted long after the Second World War.While Picasso spent the war in Nazi-occupied Paris, he was regularly harassed by the Gestapo. During one search of his apartment, an officer saw a photograph of Guernica. ‘Did you do that?’ the German asked Picasso. ‘No,’ he replied, ‘You did.’ It is thanks to the huge generosity of the Picasso Museum in Paris, which has loaned a large proportion of the best works here, that he gets his own back on Churchill and co now. Indeed, the director of the Musee Picasso has dryly mused that it’s nice to see its London branch finally opening in Piccadilly. Well, Paris’s loss for the next few weeks, is London’s gain. If you are interested in modern art in any way, you simply have to see this show. Give yourself a lot of time and, if necessary, borrow one of the collapsible chairs they offer.It’s grey outside but do make the effort. I can’t imagine there will be a more comprehensive and thoughtful exhibition of this giant of modern art in my lifetime.But do not come here, please, expecting to be soothed. Scornful of his rivals, touchy, promiscuous and blazing with anger about the politics of his time, Pablo Picasso was about as tranquilising as a barbed-wire massage.With magic in his fingers, and a flickering, butterfly mind, art’s ultimate shape-shifter ended up forcing himself to create ‘ugly’ images: because that’s how he found the world he lived in to be.Never fall for sugar-coating, or think great art should be calming. Picasso is better than that.Picasso And Paper is at the Royal Academy, London, until April 13."},{"url":null,"title":"More 35 000 self styled weirdos misfits apply work Downing Street","story":"Share this article Mr Cummings also warned that ministers who fail to get a grip on public procurement will be frowned on as the government tries to drive down waste and free up resources for the PM\u0027s priorities.

Surveying the scene from my vantage point of the Speaker’s chair, I began proceedings on this extraordinary day with a gentle but clear signal of contentment that the government’s plan to close down or “prorogue” parliament for five weeks at the height of the unresolved Brexit crisis had been foiled.“Colleagues, welcome back to our place of work.”I went on to confirm to MPs that the supreme court had sensationally ruled the previous day that parliament “had not been prorogued” and that I and my opposite number in the House of Lords should take “immediate steps to enable each house to meet as soon as possible”.In parliament, everything said is recorded and published verbatim. An accurate historical record is crucial. I therefore agreed with the senior clerks that the citation for the supreme court judgment should be entered in the Journal of the House and the item relating to the prorogation of parliament in the journal of Monday 9 September should be expunged. The house would instead be recorded as having “adjourned” at the close of business on 9 September.We began with an urgent question that I had granted to the SNP’s Joanna Cherry to ask the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, about his legal opinion on the advice given to the Queen to prorogue parliament. There was a piquancy about the question coming from her – she was her party’s spokesperson on legal and constitutional matters but, perhaps more importantly, she had actively supported the legal case brought against the government on prorogation in Scotland and England. The attorney general knew that. While legitimately seeking to draw Cox on what his legal advice had been, she was also twisting the knife in the government’s gut.Cox was both the best and the worst representative to pop up for the government that day. The best – I am being generous here – in that he is supremely articulate, opinionated, tough-minded and ready to bat for the government without the slightest hint of embarrassment or self-doubt. I have no reason to suppose that he did not believe every word he spoke. Yet if he didn’t, such was his thespian quality that he carried it off with shameless aplomb. The best in terms of playing to the gallery of shocked Tory MPs and the extreme Brexiteers of the media was also the worst to those not signed up to the message that anyone seeking to stop Brexit was somehow an enemy of the people.“This parliament is a dead parliament,” he roared. “It should no longer sit. It has no moral right to sit on those green benches ... They don’t like to hear it, Mr Speaker ... This parliament is a disgrace.”The man had worked himself up into a frenzy that oscillated between the comic and the terrifying. Visibly enjoying his sense of moral outrage at the activities of his opponents, Cox began to rotate at the despatch box, swivelling round to rouse his Conservative colleagues to paroxysms of righteous indignation. Turning his back on the house was both mildly “disorderly”, in parliamentary parlance, and very unpopular. I intervened good-naturedly: “I do not normally offer stylistic advice to the attorney general, but his tendency to perambulate while prating is disagreeable to the house. He should face the house with confidence and assurance and an acknowledgement that the house wishes to hear his every utterance.”“I wonder if you, Mr Speaker,” Cox replied, “in a well-earned retirement, would like to give lessons to frontbenchers. It could be the beginnings of a new and very glorious – or even more glorious – career.”I won’t describe the atmosphere as electric – that would be too kind, suggestive of excitement, tension and, perhaps, the constructive direction of power. It was worse, far worse, than that. The atmosphere was one of raw, intense, undiluted anger on both sides of the House of Commons, made more alarming by the direction of the anger. It was not aimed at the culprits for an external event such as a terrorist attack. Rather, the anger was that of the prime minister towards the opposition benches to opponents on his own the supreme court and, to a degree, me, as the person who had enabled opponents to express their objections to the attempted prorogation of parliament, which I had myself publicly deplored.In more than two decades in the house, a period that included the most high-octane debates over the Iraq war, I had never known a mood so toxic. The PM’s statement lasted 14 minutes, during which I had to call for order four times. In his second sentence, he referred to “this paralysed parliament”. Barely three minutes later he referred to the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act, commonly known as the Benn Act, which required the PM to seek an extension to the Brexit withdrawal date in certain circumstances, as the “surrender act”. Shortly afterwards he declared that he thought that the supreme court “was wrong to pronounce on what is essentially a political question” – adding that it had done so at a time of great national controversy.I gently but firmly underlined the premium placed by Erskine May (the bible of parliamentary procedure) on moderation and good humour in the use of language. Immediately afterwards, the PM referred to the “surrender act” yet again. Paula Sherriff, constituency neighbour of the late Jo Cox, appealed to the prime minister not to resort to the use of “offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language” about legislation that he did not like. His initial response was to say that he had “never heard such humbug”. This prompted outrage and fury on the opposition benches. Obviously the language that produced such upset was no accident. It was deliberate and calculated to press home his “parliament versus the people” narrative, plainly to be used intensively in an upcoming election campaign. Buoyed by innate self-confidence, full-throttle roars of support from most Conservative MPs and the belief that he had a winning message, Johnson did not hold back. He rammed home his script with unremitting vigour.Immediately after the exchanges on the prime minister’s statement, several MPs leapt to their feet to raise points of order. I did not know exactly what they would be but I had been told that they related to the PM and his statement. I suggested to Johnson that it would be a courtesy to stay for the first, from the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. Initially, he seemed minded to do so, but he had a change of heart and left. Later, he texted me to say that he intended no discourtesy but simply decided to stick to his original plan to leave straight after questioning on his statement. Frankly, that was disingenuous of him. The truth was that he had had enough. He didn’t care a damn what I or anyone else thought about him departing the chamber.By the end of that fateful day , I had chaired the business of the House from 11.30am to just before 11pm without a break. It was my privilege. Yet the atmosphere was worse than I had ever known it. Rancour, demonisation and contempt for opponents’ views were apparent on both sides of the house. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200124-60359-Unspeakableclip.mp3 The following day I told colleagues that we had not shown ourselves to advantage and should do better. I had not liked the prime minister’s language of “surrender” and “capitulation” at all, but it was not “disorderly”. Free speech matters. I do not believe that Johnson sought to incite violence or disorder. Rather, his was a ruthless bid to whip up support for Brexit, for his party and, last but by no means least, for himself. His entire approach to Brexit may be wrong-headed, irresponsible and damaging to the UK national interest, in my view, but that was no reason to censor him from the chair. I could appeal for restraint and I did. But I could not insist on it.Rancorous and brutal as it was, the prorogation row offered a kind of parallel with my tenure as Speaker. My entire approach in more than a decade in the chair was to seek to increase the relative authority and influence of the legislature, specifically the House of Commons, in its dealings with the executive, the government. It was never any part of my role to serve as a nodding donkey or quiescent lickspittle of the executive branch of our political system. As I had foreshadowed in seeking election as Speaker in 2009, I did not want to be someone, but to do something. The something was to stand up for parliament, encourage the House of Commons to take control of its own core functions and to assert its right fully and unsparingly to scrutinise the government of the day.Governments want a passive Speaker who will diplomatically stand aside and leave them to call the shots. I never had the slightest interest in playing that role. Likewise, within the house administration, there were always people for whom the status quo was very comfortable and who resisted any change that would threaten that comfort and privilege. My responsibility was not just to sit there, lazily administering the existing order. Rather it was to keep the best and, whether alone or with others, to improve the rest. Specifically, as Speaker, I had a duty to stand up for MPs inidually, to champion parliament institutionally and to try to make it look more like the country we are charged to represent. It was, perhaps, a fitting, albeit unanticipated denouement to my tenure to end as I had begun – following the first Speaker to be forced to resign in 300 years – on a note of explosive controversy. The government was pitted against a parliament that rightly and resolutely refused to bend the knee or to shut up. It was my privilege, and I was proud, to pipe up for parliament one last time.“He is careless with words and facts”As it happens, I like Boris Johnson. He can be charming and witty. He has never been other than courteous to me. We played tennis in January 2017 at his then official country residence, Chevening, and he took his 6–0, 6–0, 6–0 defeat with very good grace. He is not stupid, but highly intelligent, very well read and a fine conversationalist. However, he is careless with words and facts and, even by the standards of a profession in which self-regard is not uncommon, he is disproportionately preoccupied with whatever serves the cause of advancement for B Johnson. As a debater he is undistinguished and, as a public speaker, though humorous, he is often downright poor – hesitant, unable to string sentences together fluently and about as likely ever to warrant the description “captivating orator” as Bertie Wooster or his chum Gussie Fink-Nottle. Apart from those notable limitations in a man who has since become prime minister, he is, at his occasional best, a passably adequate politician in an age not replete with them.“She was tearful only when adversity affected her”Theresa May is decent but as wooden as your average coffee table, a worthy public servant but as dull as ditchwater, courteous to everyone but lacking in an ounce of small talk, honest but lacking in any original convictions, as capable as the next politician of reading a script but devoid of any spontaneity or natural fluency, let alone charisma.In her resignation speech, she attempted to describe her policy legacy. It was laughable, for there was none. She had not merely failed on her Brexit agenda, she had failed on almost everything else she had pledged to deliver. She had failed to tackle the “burning injustices”, failed to counter the explosion in knife crime, failed to address the rise in racial attacks and failed to devise a policy to meet the challenge posed by the crisis in social care.Finally, a PM who had become notorious for her absence of empathy and her robotic reiteration of vacuous mantras, suddenly displayed raw emotion about giving up the leadership of the country she loved. There were tears in her eyes and a lump in her throat. I could understand how upsetting it must have been for her but, candidly, I could not feel much sympathy. There was no such emotion over the victims of Grenfell Tower, those affected by the Windrush scandal or the daily misery endured by the homeless and those dependent on the food banks that have mushroomed alarmingly across the UK over the last decade. She was tearful only when adversity affected her.There was no trickery about her. Where David Cameron, William Hague and Michael Gove had schemed against me, she did not. Sadly, however, she was stubborn when flexibility was needed and, lacking a natural majority, she appeared frozen.May is not a bad person. She works exceptionally hard and wants the best for her country, while lacking a clear sense of what that is. Rudderless, without imagination, and with few real friends at the highest level, she stumbled on, day to day, lacking clarity, vision and the capacity to forge a better Britain. In a contest as to who has been the worst PM since 1945, it is hard to choose between Anthony Eden and Theresa May.“Coldness and oiliness in equal measure”Michael Howard and I worked well together. That is not to say that I ever liked him. Frankly, I didn’t. Some people are cold. Others are oily. His peculiar distinction was to combine coldness and oiliness in equal measure. Nevertheless, I got used to him and he to me. We had regular contact and, though his public image was poor, he was highly professional and a very accomplished performer at the despatch box.Those performances might not have resonated with the public but he lifted the morale of Conservative MPs with his efforts. Most importantly, whereas his predecessors almost visibly shrank when up against Gordon Brown, Michael was not at all intimidated by him.“He has a good sense of humour”It is no secret that most of my allies were from the Labour party. Yet for much of my speakership I had some Conservative allies and rather more of them than my most hardcore foes realised. One such was Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP for North East Somerset. Sally had been at Oxford with Jacob, but when he was first elected in 2010 we did not know each other. That soon changed. I heard him speak and we chatted at the chair, as many colleagues and I do.Jacob is a one-off, a singular specimen of humanity. In order to speak, he does not so much stand up, he “uncoils”. Overwhelmingly, he speaks without a text or notes, and addresses the house in perfect English. He develops and presents a logical argument on whatever subject with admirable fluency. Always ready to accept interventions in his speeches, he deals with them thoughtfully, playing the ball, not the man or woman, and exhibiting unfailing courtesy. He has a good sense of humour and is content not only to be teased but to take the mickey out of himself.When the Conservative leadership sought, on the last day of the 2010–15 parliament, to change the rules on the re-election of the Speaker, Jacob was scathing. He knew underhand, dishonourable behaviour when he saw it. Not only would he not go along with such chicanery, but he voted against it, humiliating the leader of the house, William Hague, in the process – albeit I doubt Hague had the emotional intelligence to realise that he had been humiliated.“He was visibly furious. Too bad.”In seeking election as Conservative leader, Cameron had gone to great lengths to portray himself as a moderniser, someone who wanted his party to “stop banging on about Europe”, to focus on public services, to support gender equality and facilitate a better work-life balance. He wanted a policy on childcare. Yet when I successfully led the drive to establish a nursery in parliament – which he used for a time – he took not the slightest interest and stood idly by while some of his neanderthal backbenchers sought to block the project. If a new idea could be presented to the greater glory of D Cameron, he was ravenous for it. If it could not, he had no appetite for it whatsoever.When he was under legitimate pressure over his links with News International and Rupert Murdoch, and I granted an urgent question to Ed Miliband to probe him, he was visibly furious. Too bad, I thought. The subject needed to be aired. It was his responsibility to step up to the plate and account for his government. Above all, what Cameron couldn’t abide was when I cut him off at PMQs for going beyond his brief, talking too long, or both. No doubt the resentment welled up in him.“The parliamentarian that Grenfell folk and the public alike wanted to hear.”No MP has spoken with greater force or passion on the Grenfell tragedy than David Lammy. Many of the victims were ethnic-minority Britons and, tellingly, Lammy and his artist wife had mentored, employed and encouraged a young woman called Khadija Saye, who died in the fire. It was raw, close to home, inescapably personal to Lammy. That fact, combined with his passionate, angry eloquence in laying bare the sheer avoidable horror of what had happened, carried real weight. On police resources, seizure of documents for investigation, the possibility of criminal charges, health assessments and bereavement counselling for survivors and finance for safe cladding, Lammy was indefatigable in questioning ministers. I am sad to say that May, Sajid Javid (the housing, communities and local government secretary at the time ) and then middle-ranking minister Dominic Raab were matter of fact, even cold, in response. I do not suggest that they did not care, but they appeared to show no empathy whatever. I felt embarrassed for them as they gave such a poor account of themselves whereas Lammy was exactly the parliamentarian that Grenfell folk and the public alike wanted to hear.This is an edited extract from Unspeakable: The Autobiography by John Bercow, published by W\u0026ampN (RRP £20) on 6 February.

We have contacted the company we know is involved and requested they not enter the store again.”The global emergence of commercial courses coaching men to be “pickup artists” has been widely condemned for teaching men who are unsuccessful in talking to or dating women to use psychological manipulation, intimidation and coercion in order to attract potential partners.Despite global opprobrium, the industry is estimated to be worth $100m a year and teaches manipulative techniques such as “negging” – insulting a woman to undermine her confidence – or “peacocking” – dressing flamboyantly for attention (when actual peacocks do it, it is known as “lekking”).The industry emerged into widespread public consciousness through journalist Neil Strauss’s 2005 book, The Game, which sold 2.5m copies but further iterations have been developed by self-styled pickup gurus such as Julien Blanc, whose visa to Australia was torn up after protests over videos published online demonstrating behaviours such as grabbing women by the throat, and forcing their heads towards his crotch, and Mystery (whose real name is Erik von Markovik).Online, readers praised Kinokuniya’s public statement to call out pickup artists and the commercial operations using their store.Writer Chloe Sargeant posted online that an apprentice “pickup artist” had approached her in a bookstore.“Today a dude tried some classic The Game pickup artist lines on me at a bookstore, and started out with ‘can you help me with a recommendation, what was your fave book of 2019?’ So I said Clementine Ford’s Fight Like a Girl. He looked a bit flustered but persevered and was like ‘oh no, I meant fiction!’“So I said The Power by Naomi Alderman and when I explained what it was about he was like ‘oh ... uh ... too scary for me, thanks anyway!’ and scurried away.“I’ll add that I’d seen him try the same thing to two different women before me. Pickup artist stuff is so grim.”Kinokinuya also issued a public warning to any other companies coaching men in “pickup” techniques: “Don’t come in.”“Our staff and security have all been made aware that this has been happening and are on the lookout for anyone who is receiving unsolicited and unwanted attention.”The store said anyone being harassed should speak with staff.“That said, the bookstore should be a place for discussion and we don’t want to discourage organic communications from taking place.“Please come in, enjoy the books and the ideas, and enjoy sharing the space with other booklovers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4446796939adecb7f29e0cde4d61f8d1cf72ead9/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8605c87be6fd120e2bb341f2fb6467ee","title":"british politics slowing down good for democracy","story":"After several frenzied, unpredictable years, for the opposition this is a period for patiently building on far-sighted ideasOver the past six years, British politics has become addicted to speed. Our often sleepy country has experienced a rush of events probably without precedent in its postwar history: two pivotal referendums three general elections, two of them called early countless parliamentary dramas and dramatic changes of leadership, poll position and ideology in all the main parties.For activists, commentators, Westminster correspondents, thinktanks with pet ideas and politicians and strategists with big ambitions, this frenzy has been thrilling: new possibilities have seemed constantly to be opening up. Hung parliaments, coalition governments, radical governments of the right or left, the restructuring of the UK and of its relationships with the world – all these rare scenarios have either happened or seemed likely to happen. Our politics, often so narrow and stuck, has seemed fluid, almost without boundaries. Some voters have enjoyed the change of pace. Turnouts at the last three general elections have been higher than in the previous three. Following politics hour by hour, even minute by minute, has become perfectly normal for people who in previous eras barely glanced at parliamentary news.Last month’s election was this manic politics brought to a kind of climax. It was preceded by months of escalating confrontations in the Commons, in the courts and on the streets. It was made possible by overexcited members of three parties: Lib Dems believing they would deliver a historic breakthrough, Scottish Nationalists that it would hasten independence, and Conservatives believing it would “get Brexit done” – the impatience of modern politics encapsulated in three words.But now, with the election over, impatience isn’t the right political approach any more – if it ever was. The Tories look likely to be in power for at least the next five years. Labour and the Lib Dems look likely to be rebuilding for years too. The Scottish independence struggle may have reached a stalemate. And the declared aims of Boris Johnson’s government – reshaping the UK’s relationship with the EU, reviving the north, overhauling Whitehall – are the work of decades, if they are achievable at all. One lesson to take from this abrupt deceleration, and how perplexing it feels, is that during the 2010s politics didn’t change as much, underneath, as those of us caught up in the surface frenzy sometimes thought. Despite the financial crisis, free-market capitalism was not reined in. The Tories ruled almost throughout. And for all the attention given to their digital campaigning in the 2019 election, they arguably won thanks largely to two ancient political forces: the Tory press and English nationalism.Another lesson is that many voters don’t like politics that happens quickly. Change can be frightening – or just a pain to keep up with. Labour’s election campaign, with its daily announcements of brand new, “transformative” policies, asked voters to choose a government that would bring years of rapid change. Not enough welcomed the prospect.How should opponents of the Conservatives adjust to a political era that is going to be slower than they hoped? There may be clues in how Labour recovered from a worse election defeat. In 1931, after a spell in office ruined by a recession and arguments about spending cuts, – just as Gordon Brown’s government was – Labour lost all but 52 seats. Yet over the next decade and a half, the party revived so thoroughly that in 1945 it won its famous landslide.“While the second world war undoubtedly accentuated the advance, it was not the origins of it,” writes Martin Pugh in his history of the party. “The 1930s proved to be a crucial formative phase.” During that decade, Labour elected a leader, Clement Attlee, who was uncharismatic but a good unifier of its factions. It resisted pressure to make its economic approach more centrist. It took control of London’s municipal government and used it as a showcase for radical policies. Despite press hostility, and a BBC much more interested in the Conservatives, Labour steadily grew its support – particularly in the south and among the young, who often suffered most from a sluggish, unbalanced economy and the Tories’ austerity policies.The 1930s were a long time ago, and slow politics was easier to practise then, in a totally different media environment. But the period demonstrates something about the left that some of those inside it, and many outside, often forget: success tends to come from sticking to controversial but far-sighted ideas and patiently building new electoral coalitions around them, rather than from sudden breakthroughs during times of social and economic turbulence.During the 2019 election, Jeremy Corbyn and Labour seemed to forget that his most potent political feature –his moral authority – had been built up over decades. He campaigned in too much of a hurry. His successor is going to have to ignore demands to demonstrate immediate progress. Politics may have settled down, but many voters and journalists remain impatient with it, as Johnson will find out when his honeymoon ends. Even the SNP – electorally secure in ways Labour and the Tories can only dream of – may increasingly struggle to persuade some of its supporters that independence is going to take years more. Politics might also become more measured if the media treated it less like a soap opera, and more like something connected to how Britons are actually living, and how that’s always changing.British politics isn’t going to slow right down. The electoral system creates volatility. There will always be crises some already under way, such as the climate emergency, can’t wait years for governments to attend to them. But unless the UK accepts again that politics sometimes needs to be slow, its political life will be all stalemates and frenzies. Neither is a great environment for democracy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4c74a562eb2c5b9c1e1bf2093848a3894dd1e47/0_176_5270_3162/master/5270.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38f6469872fdd369480a099879280112","title":"davos world economic forum capitalism plutocracy","story":"No amount of window dressing can change the nature of the World Economic Forum – a club for capitalism’s elitesThe World Economic Forum (WEF) is an odd event, but also the perfect insight into the problems of political activism in today’s world. Every year a select(ed) group of a few thousand people travel to the remote Swiss town of Davos, many in their own or their corporate private planes, to discuss the global economic, political and social issues of the day, including climate change. Economic leaders rub shoulders with political leaders, and prominent social activists provide a flavor of social responsibility.For years now the media have been writing that the WEF takes place as “capitalism is in crisis”, but while this might be true in general, the vast majority of the WEF participants continue to do well. They have learned to adapt to criticism, be it from the anti-globalization movement of the 1990s or from the far right today. Include the most malleable, shower them with praise, write a communique that you have understood their message, make some cosmetic changes and continue with what you have been doing from the beginning.The WEF 2020 meeting was yet another example of this routine. It touted its “young change-makers”, who entertained the old(er) change-frustraters with passionate speeches about issues like climate change, gun violence, pollution and racism. Obviously, “Greta” (who no longer needs a last name) was there, holding the grownups to account, playing on their parental guilt, and giving the international media the quotes they came for: “Our house is still on fire.”There are also some “old change-makers”, less touted but more respected, most notably impeached president Donald Trump. He had dominated the 2017 WEF in absence, surprised his audience as a “pragmatist” in 2018, and skipped Davos again in 2019. This year he returned to boast about “his” economic accomplishments, using it both as a distraction from the impeachment trials and as part of the permanent re-election campaign. While his speech was full of distortions and lies, as usual, it raised few concerns among the Davos crowd. Trump has long been domesticated and (the people who drive) the markets love him.In an op-ed in the  last week, which was much debated and mocked on social media, self-proclaimed co-founder of Occupy Wall Street Micah White explained why he was “headed to Davos”. Allegedly, there is a “hidden Davos”, and White was going on a great discovery expedition to find it. “In the hidden Davos,” according to White, “opposing social forces, activists and elites, can put their egos and personas aside to speak freely and find common cause for joint action on the global crises that impact us all – from income inequality to climate change.”I don’t know whether he found it, but based on the first 50 years of the World Economic Forum, this “hidden Davos” has proven to be fairly irrelevant. Sure, Davos has helped elevate the public profile of important activists and voices for change, including “Greta” and my fellow Dutchman Rutger Bregman, last year. But neither has changed the agenda of the World Economic Forum, let alone the priorities of the economic and political elites.In essence, the World Economic Forum is the high priest of plutocracy, ie rule by the ultra-wealthy. It is a good example of the enduring ideological legacy of neoliberalism, an often-ignored aspect of neoliberal hegemony. While states have held on to significant control over national economies, national politicians have largely renounced their power over the economy and politics. Believing that “the market” is the best mechanism to solve every issue, from employment to healthcare, economists and entrepreneurs are now seen as the best problem solvers for our political problems.As the US writer Anand Giridharadas does not tire of emphasizing, the “plutocrats’ phony religion” of philanthropy is no substitute for the state. And neither is “stakeholder capitalism” or whatever expensive rebranding the Davos crowd come up with to sell their old wine in new bottles. They are not fundamentally changing the exploitative nature of capitalism, of both nature and people, and will not stand up to authoritarian leaders – in fact, they often embrace them.So, rather than fawning over billionaires who donate tiny percentages of their massive wealth to issues of their choosing or providing entertainment and normative cover for exploitative big business, activists for social change should call for stricter regulation and fairer taxes by their inidual states. Only then will they have a true opportunity to regain control over the political agenda and will they, rather than the plutocrats, be able to decide which issues to focus on and how to support them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f328ae4230d567c94a6f1fbd38df45cbfbe43a8/161_124_745_447/master/745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b214ecdfc88be09d1655df36080db594","title":"humpback whales bunny chow and golden beaches why you should visit durban","story":"Desperate for a dose of winter sun? South Africa’s Durban delivers 320 days of sunshine every year, as well as surfing, foodie adventures and sensational land and sea safariOnce seen as the quiet cousin of cosmopolitan Cape Town and fast-paced Johannesburg, the natural wonders and cultural charms of Durban and its surrounds put it firmly on South Africa’s must-see map. Fly direct from London Heathrow to Durban with British Airways, then get exploring.The best place for a first-look at “Durbs” – as the locals call it – is down on the Golden Mile, an iconic stretch (nearly three-miles long, not one, as its name would have you believe) of powdery beaches backed by a colourful pedestrian promenade, all of it smartened up for the 2010 World Cup.Shimmering off to the north is another legacy project of the tournament, the Moses Mabhida Stadium. An 80-metre freefall and 220-metre arc makes the Big Rush Big Swing from the stadium arch the world’s tallest swing, while the more sedate SkyCar delivers superb views of the city and its beaches.With miles of golden sand, and water that rarely dips below 20C, Durban richly deserves its reputation as South Africa’s surfing capital. Surf schools on the promenade – try Xpression or Learn 2 Surf – will have you up and riding in no time. The smaller waves of South Beach are best for beginners, while expert surfers will delight in the long tubes of New Pier.From May to November, these seas are also home to humpback and southern right whales, while Bryde’s, sperm and minke whales inhabit the oceans all year round. Look out for lobtailing, when a whale slaps its tail on the water to create waves, and breaching, when a whale launches out of the water as if ready to backflip. And that wasn’t enough, you can often spot dolphins ing in the crests of the waves. Whale and Dolphin Tours offer daily aquatic safari cruises from Durban marina the company is committed to training tour guides from disadvantaged communities and supporting Whale Time’s environmental research.Oceans aside, Durban is giving Cape Town a run for its money when it comes to culinary adventures. On tree-lined Florida Road you’ll find a neat cross section of the city’s resurgent kitchen creativity, from pan-African flavours at Dukkah to the ice-cream-filled macaroons of chef Zakeeya Mitha’s Sugarlicious. The falooda-inspired Bombay crush ice-cream is the go-to here.But when it comes to dining, Durban is all about curry. Don’t leave without braving the famous “bunny chow”: a quarter-loaf of white bread, hollowed out and filled with bean or mutton curry. You’ll find bunny chow across the city, but in Durban central the Oriental restaurant is an institution. A mutton bunny will set you back just R79.95 (£4.19).It’s also just a short walk from the colourful Victoria Street Market, where spice shops are piled high with fiery bespoke blends. Around the corner, the Juma Masjid is worth a look. It’s one of the largest mosques in the southern hemisphere, the domed facade completed in 1943.There’s certainly plenty to keep you busy in the city, but as the capital of KwaZulu-Natal province Durban is also the perfect starting point for adventures farther afield. With public transport thin on the ground, an Avis rental car is your best bet.A 20-minute drive north of the city brings you to the seaside suburb of Umhlanga, long favoured by South African holidaymakers. You’ll want to spend time exploring the walking trails of the Umhlanga Lagoon Nature Reserve, or browsing the weekly Wednesday morning farmers’ market, but first drop your bags at the Oyster Box hotel, an elegant grande dame of South Africa’s seaside hotels. The pool terrace delivers impressive views – of breaching whales and the ocean – but the attentive staff will also happily set up deckchairs and umbrellas on the beach for you. And there’s no need to venture out in search of dinner: the generous curry buffet here is legendary. Beware the fiery beef vindaloo.Another 30 minutes’ drive along the Dolphin Coast brings you to Zimbali Coastal Resort, where the Fairmont Zimbali Resort offers 154 luxury rooms, secluded beaches and easy access to the resort’s excellent 18-hole golf course, which plays through lush coastal forest. Bring plenty of spare balls.South Africa is synonymous with safari, and Phinda Private Game Reserve and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi park are just two hours’ drive farther north, with a clutch of upscale safari lodges dishing up five-star luxury and Big Five sightings. As well as lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants and buffalo, you may even catch a glimpse of the elusive cheetah.Or head west from Durban, towards the rugged peaks of the Drakensberg mountains. The uKhahlamba-Drakensberg park was declared a world heritage site in 2000, noted for its ancient San rock art and rugged scenery. The historic battlefields of central KwaZulu-Natal are also within easy reach for travellers with a car, with talented guides bringing the drama and tragedy of the protracted Anglo-Zulu wars of the late-1800s to life.So now, the choice is yours. Battles? The Big Five? Beaches? Bunny chow? One thing’s for certain, Durban is no longer second fiddle when it comes to cosmopolitan coastal escapes in South Africa.How to bookWith direct flights from London Heathrow to Durban, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

The meandering drive – stretching more than 120 miles from Mossel Bay in the west, to Storms River in the east – takes in dappled forests, still lakes and surf-pummeled beaches. It’s best explored on four wheels, but be sure to take your time. British Airways flies direct to Cape Town, where you can pick up an Avis hire car, belt up and settle into a truly picturesque ride.Humpback whales can often be spotted breaching clear out of the water at Hermanus, just a 90-minute drive from Cape Town. You can even spot whales lolling metres from the shoreline – keep your ears primed for the huff of a humpback whale exhaling right by your feet. The town hosts an annual whale festival each September – when huge southern right whales pass by in large numbers – and there’s even a whale crier, who alerts crowds to the presence of the animals by blowing on a kelp horn. July to October is a great time to see pods of migrating mothers with their calves and, if you’re feeling languid, the Marine Hotel is perfectly situated on a clifftop overlooking the ocean, so you’ll be able to spot barnacle-clad beasts from your balcony.A 40-minute trundle down the road, you’ll find Gansbaai. Known by locals as the Serengeti of the sea, the waters here are bristling with sea creatures, including the marine big five: whales, dolphins, seals, penguins and sharks. The latter can be seen in their menacing masses in Shark Alley – a sliver of ocean that roils with cape fur seals, the great white’s favourite prey.It’s a four-hour journey from Gansbaai to Oudtshoorn, but you’ll have plenty of screensaver scenery to gawp at along the way, including the craggy Tradouw mountain pass and the twisty-turny Huisrivier pass, which clings to the side of a mountain where cape leopards still roam. As well as the Cango Caves – an impressive prehistoric limestone system, dripping with troll-like rock formations, stalagmites and stalactites – Oudtshoorn boasts the largest number of ostriches in the world, with many of the farms offering tractor rides or walks out in the fields with the colossal birds.Head almost due south towards the coast and you’ll soon reach Knysna – a charming holiday town right at the heart of the Garden Route. Here, you’ll find a vast aquamarine lagoon spilling out into the ocean from between two huge sandstone headlands, helpfully known as the Heads. Hike through the lush forest – thought of as the lungs of this beautiful town – or take a trip out on to the water where you can fish, kayak, water ski and swim.A half-hour drive east is Plettenberg Bay. Home to the rocky Robberg Nature Reserve – where you can snorkel with rambunctious seals – a satisfyingly sandy central beach and the Nelson Bay caves, which date back to the stone age. This is also a great place to take part in a township tour (run by Ocean Blue Adventures). Meet up with a local from the Qolweni community and join them on a visit to the township’s Siyakhula crèche, the central shebeen and other lively spots, meeting some of the friendly locals and learning about the township’s rich history along the way. Come evening, stay at the remarkable Tsala Treetop Lodge just out of town – a collection of elegant elevated hideaways decked out in Afro-baroque style and hidden among the canopy of the ancient indigenous forest.Locals like to call Tsitsikamma, just north of Storms River – “the garden of the Garden Route”. An old Khoisan word, Tsitsikamma means “place of much water”, and whether it’s the yawning river valleys, the flinty ocean or the dew-daubed forest that clings to the mountains, this place is most certainly lush. Don your hiking boots for a lung-cleansing hike around this beautiful landscape, then make your final drive to Storms River, where – if the mood strikes – you can mark the end of your epic road trip by hurling yourself off the Bloukrans Bridge – the world’s highest bridge to bungee off.How to bookWith direct flights from London to Cape Town, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

We should listen closely to their recommendations.”The climate assembly has been set up along the lines of the citizens’ assembly in France, instituted by the president, Emmanuel Macron.The assembly was selected to be a representative sample of the population after a mail-out to 30,000 people chosen at random. About 2,000 people responded saying they wanted to be considered for the assembly, and the 110 members were picked by computer.The UK climate assembly differs from the French model in that it was commissioned by six select committees, rather than by the prime minister. Its views, which will be produced in a report in the spring, will be considered by the select committees but there is no guarantee the government will take up any of the proposals.The assembly will meet for four weekends this spring. On the third weekend it will begin making decisions about ways to meet the net-zero target.Prominent business, faith and civil society leaders from across the UK have sent messages of support to the assembly.Prof Lord Krebs, a former member of the climate change committee, said: “Climate change is the defining issue of our time. Without action now, we will leave an uninhabitable planet for our children and their children.“The climate assembly will play a key role in helping to inform all who need to take action: iniduals, businesses, local government and community groups and, crucially, central government.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cdd9be9c9d0478bd0914513184c4e6edcef8dab/0_239_3271_1962/master/3271.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4c1e76c57b61d89f74d11809f7e57b0","title":"cacao not gold chocolate trees offer future to amazon tribes aoe","story":"In Brazil’s largest indigenous reserve thousands of saplings have been planted as an alternative to profits from illegal gold miningThe villagers walk down the grassy landing strip, past the wooden hut housing the health post and into the thick forest, pointing out the seedlings they planted along the way. For these Ye’kwana indigenous men, the skinny saplings, less than a metre high, aren’t just baby cacao trees but green shoots of hope in a land scarred by the violence, pollution and destruction wrought by illegal gold prospecting. That hope is chocolate.“We want to plant and develop income for the community,” says Júlio Ye’kwana, 39, president of the Ye’kwana people’s Wanasseduume association, which came up with the idea. “And it is not destructive for the forest.”In the last two years, thousands of Theobroma cacao trees have been planted near Waikás and other villages in the remote Yanomami indigenous reserve. The saplings were planted within the forest because cacao likes shade, an idea borrowed from agroforestry techniques successfully used for cacao elsewhere in the Amazon.Villagers hope that within a few years rich, organic chocolate will be produced from the golden cacao fruit these trees bear. The project – run by the reserve’s indigenous associations Wanasseduume and Hutukara with Brazilian non-profit group Instituto Socioambiental (ISA) – is ambitious, but experts say it is based on a potential commercial reality.Located in the far north of the Brazilian Amazon, Yanomami is Brazil’s biggest indigenous reserve, spread over 9.6 million hectares (23.7m acres). But its wild, mountainous forests are overrun by an estimated 20,000 wildcat goldminers, called garimpeiros.Ye’kwana and Yanomami indigenous leaders called for the garimpeiros to be expelled with a letter and group photo later shared by actor Leonardo DiCaprio.But the country’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has claimed that indigenous people really yearn for white society’s consumer lifestyles, said the Yanomami reserve is too big for its population and may be sued for racism by the Brazilian Indigenous People’s Association after comments during a Facebook Live broadcast this week. “The indigenous changed, they are evolving,” he said. “More and more the indigenous are human beings equal to us.”“The president says indigenous people are poor. We are not poor. Nobody goes hungry here,” says Júlio Ye’kwana. “We eat for free.” was invited to visit by the Hutukara Yanomami Association, founded by Davi Kopenawa, a leader and shaman who fought to create the reserve with photographer Claudia Andujar and non-profit group Survival International.Five villages from both tribes are participating in the cacao project. Cacao trees are native in this area, but around 3,000 new seedlings have been planted to boost production, with 7,000 expected by the end of 2021.Edmilson Estevão shins up a mature cacao tree to bring down some of the heavy yellow fruit. Inside each thick shell is a sticky cluster of seeds, packed in a sweet, delicious, pale paste. These are dried and roasted to make chocolate.“One tree like this can bear up to 20 fruit,” says Estevão, 33, who was raised in Waikás and works for Wanasseduume.These mature trees were planted more than a decade ago by Luiz Ye’kwana. He was murdered by garimpeiros after refusing to transport them upriver, villagers say.Violence is a recurrent problem around garimpeiros, as becomes graphically evident the next day. Outside the health post, two garimpeiros are wrapping a dead body in a tarpaulin. The dead man was known as Eduardo at Tatuzão, the illegal gold mining camp two hours’ boat ride upstream. But everybody uses an alias there. The nurse who fought to save his life discovered that his real name was Ralf Cabral and he was 21. The garimpeiros say he shot himself.His eyes are wide open, he is dressed in black football shorts, and there is a bandage over the bullet hole in his chest. “He’s been here for five months, and now he’s done this,” says Manoel dos Santos, 49, wrapping Cabral’s body. “I have no idea why.”The health post was built by the Brazilian government to serve the village’s 150 Ye’kwana people, but also handles hundreds of garimpeiro cases each year, including miscarriages, malaria, snake bites, broken limbs, knife and gunshot wounds. “It’s a war here,” says Giselle Dornellas, 33, the nurse who kept Cabral alive for 12 hours.Garimpo gold is seductive and buys televisions and phones. Four villagers work as boat pilots, others deliver food, and even the village community centre was built with garimpo money.But the cacao project will offer an alternative, says its coordinator, ISA anthropologist Moreno Saraiva. “We’re trying to build another possible future,” he says. “It will take five years, but if we don’t do this now there will never be another alternative.”The project was inspired by another ISA project that since 2016 has produced edible mushrooms in other Yanomami villages. On paper the cacao project makes sense. Most of the world’s cacao production is in Africa, but the plant is native to the Amazon and was domesticated in South America 4,000 years ago. The Aztecs used the beans as money. And a Spanish map from 1775 called the Yanomami area the “Pais de los cacaguales” – or “Cacao Land”.“You have a traditional and well-spread presence of native cocoa trees,” says food researcher Roberto Smeraldi, vice-president of the Atá Institute founded by Alex Atala – the Michelin starred Brazilian chef renowned for using ingredients from the Amazon.Smeraldi recruited César de Mendes, a chocolate specialist based near the Amazon city of Belém for the cacao project. ISA and the indigenous associations organised well-attended workshops with de Mendes in Waikás in 2018 and 2019 to show villagers how cacao seeds are processed to make chocolate.Fruit from mature Yanomami cacao trees was used to produce a trial run. A thousand 50g bars of the bitter, delicious Yanomami chocolate quickly sold out at an event in São Paulo last December, despite a £9.20 price tag. Customers were happy to pay to compensate for the destruction caused by garimpo, de Mendes says. Profits went to both indigenous associations.“I am not being much of a businessman, I am being more an activist,” de Mendes says. “We are selling to an aware public.”He learned his trade from his grandmother, who made her own chocolate in an Amazon riverside community, and singles out the Yanomami chocolate’s notes of almond oil and flowers, light acidity and sweetness. “These give this cacao its own personality,” he says.Smeraldi argues that the Yanomami cacao’s origins in this isolated jungle could make its genetic properties attractive to the world cacao industry, which is vulnerable to climate change and blights such as the witches’ broom fungus which ravaged cacao plantations in the state of Bahia three decades ago.And the chocolate’s strong, persistent taste could find its niche in the booming, specialist chocolate market, he says. Distinct fruits and flavours are increasingly sought out, as happened with wine when customers graduated from ordering “red” or “white” to specific grapes and countries. “It is a product of high complexity,” Smeraldi says.But Bolsonaro’s government is heading in the opposite direction. It is sending a bill to Congress to legalise garimpo, which the energy minister, Admiral Bento Albuquerque, recently presented to European diplomats.The news chills villagers in Waikás. “If Bolsonaro succeeds, it’s the end for our people,” says Eduardo da Silva, 65. But it has also bolstered support for the cacao project.“We have to do it for our children, not for us,” says Felipe Gimenes, 45, the village schoolteacher and former chief who planted an extra 200 cacao seedlings on his own plot. “This is our opportunity.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/992c22d884f25bfd2370ab0e269c698ece919b0c/0_550_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d0fae95b1b89c1cd3da376b70d9c97b","title":"climate change election 2020 youth activism","story":"Young demonstrators aim to make the climate crisis a central issue of the presidential campaignOrganizers in the youth climate movement plan an avalanche of activities beginning next week, determined to make the future of the climate the major issue of the 2020 election.Capitalizing on turnout in the September climate strikes, when 6 million people worldwide turned out to demand urgent action to address the escalating ecological emergency, young US organizers are making the leap from mobilization to demands. They’re planning widespread voter activation in the 2020 US presidential election as well as direct action targeting the fossil fuel industry and the banks and politicians that enable it.“The headline message of the strikes in 2020 is: the kids are taking to the streets to strike for climate and they’re asking you to vote,” said Katie Eder, the executive director of Future Coalition, a communications and training hub for youth climate groups.There are more than 300 organizations involved in the efforts, Eder said, including some of the largest youth and adult coalitions in climate movement: Fridays for Future, the Sunrise Movement, 350.org, Zero Hour, Extinction Rebellion.“We’re starting to have the conversation within the strikes about how we’re balancing both the political targets and the financial targets,” Eder said, calling power and money “really key to the root causes of why we’re not addressing climate change”.Activists have planned widespread voter mobilization campaigns three days of national strikes, marches, and direct action against politicians and banks beginning on Earth Day (22 April) regular strikes on Fridays and additional strikes targeting primary elections in every state plus an international day of action, college estment campaigns, and a huge push by the Sunrise Movement to turn out the vote for Bernie Sanders and a Green New Deal.Stories of climate awakening are a universal truth for young Americans living in the age of worsening climate conditions. Isabella Fallahi, who has asthma, for example, has lived within 14 miles of a coal-burning generating facility all of her life.“A lot of people don’t think of Indiana, or the midwest, for that matter, as frontline communities,” she said. “We face the silent killers. The terrible air quality because of mining projects, the terrible water quality because of mining projects, the health effects associated with both of those, droughts that cripple the agricultural economies that we’re based off of.”But Fallahi, like many other young organizers, is also galvanized by the tech proficiency of her generation, born into the era of hashtags and the ubiquitous touchscreen. She was a speaker at the UN climate change conference in Madrid (COP 25) in December 2019, when she and other youth were nearly ejected for protesting against the fossil fuel executives on panels and in negotiations.Approximately 200 young people in 40 countries, many of whom were at the conference, organized a response called Polluters Out. In 20 days, they had a website, a multilingual launch video, a press release in seven languages, and a list of demands. In actions set for March, they will call for the exclusion of fossil fuel interests at COP26 and transparency in the UN framework on climate change, as well as inclusion of indigenous and human rights in the Paris agreement. Regional efforts in the US will also call for a Green New Deal, a halt to new fossil fuel infrastructure, estments from fossil fuels by universities and campaign funds, and the targeting of specific banks for fossil fuel investments.The groups stay in touch through conference calls, Slack, Zoom, and Google Drive. Activists in Cuba – who can’t download the apps because of the US trade embargo – tune in through WhatsApp. There’s a Slack channel for supporting scientists, too. And meetings wait for organizers in the Amazon who need to travel to towns for internet access.For all of them, there is community. People to cry with over the photo of the bay in Australia, so covered in smoke that it is hardly visible.“Overall, I think the way to look at this perspective on the youth movement is: it is cohesive in that they do communicate, but the orgs are not all the same,” said Natalie Mebane, associate director of US Policy for 350.org and an adult mentor for Zero Hour, both organizations intensely focused on voter turnout for climate for 2020. “We want to make sure that climate becomes the number one issue on voters’ minds.”The Sunrise Movement, like 350.org and Zero Hour, has taken that to a grassroots level. That is how Naina Agrawal-Hardin ended up in the guidance office at Washtenaw high school outside Ann Arbor, Michigan, for an interview. She’s a leader for the Ann Arbor hub of the Sunrise Movement. And she’s 16, a junior. Her school, she said, was supportive.“Whenever I have to take conference calls or interviews during school hours, they usually will write me a pass to get out of class,” she said.Agrawal-Hardin is planning a watch party at her home – a sneak peek at the forthcoming documentary Generation Green New Deal and a video about the Sunrise Movement’s 2020 campaign, as part of its annual kickoff. Sunrise provides the documentaries, discussion questions, and near-daily training on organizing and recruitment techniques. When Agrawal-Hardin hosts her event on 29 January, she’ll be one of more than 2,000 hosts nationwide.Through 2020, the Sunrise Movement will similarly activate its 300 chapters in support of Bernie Sanders, leveraging 10,000 volunteers in most of the 50 states for door knocks, voting pledges and climate education. Sunrise endorsed Sanders as the best-positioned candidate to lead a Green New Deal and address income inequality.“By primarycaucus day in Iowa and New Hampshire, we are going to have over 20,000 young people who have signed pledges to vote for Green New Deal champions” in the two states, said Sofie Karasek, a Sunrise Movement spokesperson. “What we’re really expecting to see in 2020 is Young Green New Deal voters really become the margin of victory for whoever becomes the Democratic nominee.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6863633869f5a7877dafb2cd835568c6476e3e56/0_55_1999_1199/master/1999.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39c980681fbc018f697f9538916e2fd1","title":"yellowstone wolf project 25th anniversary","story":"Twenty-five years ago, the national park attempted to reintroduce wolves – now scientists are celebrating it as one of the greatest rewilding stories everTwenty-five years ago this month, wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone, America’s first national park and an ecosystem dangerously out of whack owing to the extirpation of its top predator.This monumental undertaking marked the first deliberate attempt to return a top-level carnivore to a large ecosystem. Now scientists are celebrating the gray wolves’ successful return from the brink of extinction as one of the greatest rewilding stories the world has ever seen.“The pressure was huge with this project,” said Doug Smith, the senior wildlife biologist of the Yellowstone Wolf Project who was hired by the National Park Service (NPS) to head the reintroduction in the 1990s. “If we couldn’t do this here, on our own turf in one of the most famous parks in the world, as one of the richest nations in the world, then who could? This was an example to the globe in restoring nature.”But because wolves are one of the most controversial animals on the planet, the recovery remains fiercely contested.Wolves once roamed from the Arctic to Mexico, but they were hunted to eradication across the country from the 1870s onward. By 1926, the last wolf pack had been killed in Yellowstone by park employees as part of the policy of the time to eliminate all predators.When the Endangered Species Act (ESA) was enacted in the 70s, wolves were among the original species on the list. The ESA, a landmark piece of legislation to save declining species from extinction, compels the US Fish and Wildlife Service to protect endangered or threatened species and develop a plan for their recovery. But because wolves are so polarizing, the reintroduction did not take place until more than 20 years later.The need for restoration was glaring. In the 70 years of the wolves’ absence, the entire Yellowstone ecosystem had fallen out of balance. Coyotes ran rampant, and the elk population exploded, overgrazing willows and aspens. Without those trees, songbirds began to decline, beavers could no longer build their dams and riverbanks started to erode. Without beaver dams and the shade from trees and other plants, water temperatures were too high for cold-water fish.In 1995, in collaboration with Canadian agencies, 14 wolves were captured in Jasper national park and brought to Yellowstone. Smith recalls that as they transported the wolves through the park in horse trailers, people lined the roads to be part of the historic event. “Every time we stopped, visitors would come up and ask if they could pose next to the trailer. You couldn’t even see the wolves in there, but people wanted photos. That’s the presence and magic that wolves have, and that’s the first time we all felt that.”In Yellowstone, the wolves were kept in acclimation pens for several weeks to keep their homing instincts from leading them back to Canada. Shortly after the pens were opened, though, wolf No 10 headed north and crossed the border into Montana, followed by No 9, his mate, pregnant with pups. He was illegally shot by a rancher, but she and her eight pups were rescued and moved back to the safety of park boundaries. Their bloodline can be traced to most of the wolves in the park to this day.Scientists always knew that as the top predator, wolves were the missing piece in this ecosystem. But they were astonished at how quickly their return stimulated a transformation. The elk and deer populations started responding immediately. Within about 10 years, willows rebounded. In 20, the aspen began flourishing. Riverbanks stabilized. Songbirds returned as did beavers, eagles, foxes and badgers. “And those are just the things we have the time and funding to study,” said Smith. “There are probably myriad other effects just waiting to be discovered.”While the restoration of wolves in Yellowstone has cost about $30m, wolf ecotourism brings in $35m  annually, in an economic boom for the surrounding communities. Yellowstone is unique in the world as the best place to observe wild wolves, which are generally shy, reclusive and favor remote areas. This is as true for scientists as it is tourists, and as a result, wolf research in the park is considered far more advanced than anywhere else.Wolves have repopulated parts of their historic range as far south as Colorado, where evidence of a pack was just discovered earlier this month, as far west as Mount Lassen in northern California, and to the doorsteps of the Cascades in eastern Oregon and Washington.“It truly is going to go down in my career as one of those defining moments I was proud of to be part of from the beginning, that’s shaping the politics of conservation,” said Jamie Rappaport Clark, president and CEO of Defenders of Wildlife, which organized political support and legal actions for reintroduction and remains committed to restoring wolves to their historic ranges.“At the same time, it’s not finished. We have not restored wolves to where they can and should be where it’s ecologically correct. We still have a lot of conflict, and concerns.” If state plans weren’t so “over-controlling, wolves would be running over the spine of the Rockies into the south-west today”.When wolves were deemed recovered enough to be removed from the endangered species list, management of populations was left to each state. In Wyoming, people are allowed to shoot wolves on sight outside the borders of national parks.

Line a 27cm x 40cm swiss roll tin with baking paper. Using an electric beater, whisk the eggs and sugar until light and fluffy – it should treble in volume. Fold in the flour, a little at a time, then the orange zest, until fully incorporated and leaving no flour pockets. Finally, fold in the butter and vanilla.Gently tip the mix into the tin, and bake for 15 minutes, until the sponge is pale, cooked and springy. Leave to cool a little on a wire rack (leave the oven on), then turn out on to a sheet of baking paper lightly dusted with sugar.Run a rolling pin over the sponge very gently to flatten it slightly. While it is still warm, carefully roll it up along the longest edge. Take it half way, turn the sponge around and roll from the other side to meet your first roll. Leave to cool.Toast the hazelnuts in the oven for 10 minutes. Once cooled, blitz or roughly chop, then ide the nuts into two batches.Next, brush the filo sheets with 50g melted butter and put in the oven for five to seven minutes, until light golden brown.In a large bowl, whisk the mascarpone, hazelnut spread, cream cheese, sifted icing sugar and vanilla extract with an electric mixer until lighter and slightly thicker. Add the double cream, whisk until it holds its shape, then put in the fridge.Melt the chocolate in the microwave in 20-second bursts, stirring between each one, or over a bain marie. Set aside.Once cold, slice through the middle where the two rolls meet. Unroll, spread a thin, even layer of filling over the top of the sponges, reserving a little for decoration, then sprinkle with half the toasted hazelnuts. Reroll each sponge into two swiss rolls, trim the edges, then cut each roll into three, so that you have six mini rolls.Taking one roll at a time, dip both ends in the melted chocolate, then the remaining hazelnuts, stand each vertically on a board . Repeat with the remaining rolls and transfer to the fridge until the chocolate sets.Break the filo sheets into shards. Once the chocolate has set, remove the rolls from the fridge, pipe a little hazelnut cream on one end and wedge in a filo shard. Finish with a dusting of icing sugar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a7be4ac48ea5d12ff7bb162c1dfb8b116496b3c/0_280_3503_2102/master/3503.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a134c6ac0cd594c4090136d5e022f00","title":"meera sodha masala baked beans on toast recipe vegan","story":"A frugal-but-fun remix of the classic beans on toast – ideal for lazy lunches or even lazier mornings, with a spicy-sour green chutney on the sideMy mother grew up in relative wealth in Uganda, but entered into poverty when she and her family arrived in the UK after being exiled by the dictator Idi Amin.Having little money meant cooking very thriftily: she made chutney from fallen apples in the garden, bought sacks of lentils and rice from wholesalers, and ate a lot of spiced masala baked beans. I am by no means poor, but this time in January (post-Christmas, pre-payday) can be very testing, and these beans are some of the most frugal but delicious things a person can eat.Eat these for breakfast, lunch or dinner, on toast or with chapatis, and with or without a little non-dairy yoghurt or the green chutney. This makes enough beans to top two slices of toast generously, so double it to serve more.For the beans 2 tbsp rapeseed oil 1 large brown onion, peeled and finely chopped2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced 1½ green finger chillies 1 heaped tsp tomato puree1 tsp ground coriander ½ tsp ground turmeric ½ tsp ground cumin ¼ tsp fine sea salt 1 x 400g tin Heinz baked beansFor the chutney60g coriander (leaves and tender stalks) 1½ green finger chillies 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice ½ tsp fine sea salt 2 tbsp rapeseed oil 2 tbsp roasted salted peanutsMake the chutney first.

Roughly chop the drained coriander, then throw it into a blender with the chillies, lemon juice, salt, oil and peanuts, and blitz to a smooth chutney (the coriander, being wet, will help it blend), adding a drop of water, if need be. Taste and adjust the lemon, salt and chilli as you wish – this chutney should be sour, herbal and hot – then scrape into a bowl and leave to one side.To cook the beans, heat the oil in a frying pan and, once it’s hot, add the onion and cook, stirring regularly, for 10 minutes, until soft, golden and translucent. Add the garlic and chilli, cook, stirring, for three minutes more, then add the tomato puree, all the spices and the salt. Cook for two minutes, then add the beans and a half-tin’s worth of water, and cook for five minutes, until the sauce has thickened a little, then turn off the heat.Toast the bread and put on two plates, spread generously with your favourite spread, pile the beans on top and decorate Jackson Pollock-style with the coriander chutney, or just spoon it over, as you wish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbedfd2bf2291ccd3ab8fe859cbb3dc10e4dac41/0_218_1932_1159/master/1932.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc89e5aa20dbc329247d779babcb7fc5","title":"teenagers campaign for traffic light labels on food packaging","story":"Group calls for warnings to be displayed on items high in fat, salt and sugar to tackle obesityA fledgling campaign group led by teenagers is calling for traffic light-style front of pack labelling to be made mandatory in the UK.The Bite Back 2030 campaign said progress on improving child health was stalling and that the move would bring the UK in line with other countries. These include Israel, which this week announced new laws making warning labels compulsory on packaged products high in fat, salt and sugar. Elsewhere, Canada also plans to introduce mandatory warning labels, while Chile introduced them in 2016.In October, the public health minister, Jo Churchill, publicly committed to launching a review into labelling in the UK early this year.Bite Back 2030 was set up in 2019 to create an “unstoppable movement” of young people to campaign for healthier eating. Its aim is to half childhood obesity by 2030. It was co-founded by chef Jamie Oliver, who has criticised the way junk food is advertised.The organisation has a youth board consisting of 12 teenage activists, who are lobbying food companies and the government to improve access to healthy food. It is also urging young influencers to send out more positive messages about healthy eating to their millions of social media followers.As well as Oliver, its ambassadors include model David Gandy, comedian Romesh Ranganathan, Love Island star Dr Alex George and experts from medical, nutritional and campaigning backgrounds.Bite Back 2030’s youth chair, 16-year-old Christina Adane from south London, said: “Labelling should be there to help us – not make it harder to know what’s healthy for us and what’s not.“We want honest, simple and helpful labelling like the traffic light system out there on everything. And if food companies won’t do it voluntarily, we want the government to step up and step in. The UK should be leading by example, not falling behind.”In the UK, younger generations are becoming obese at earlier ages and staying obese for longer.

It’s an opportunity to feel it, to smell it, to taste it. What would it look like if that was us every Sunday?”In 2018 the FA opened bidding for places in the fully professional Women’s Super League and semi-professional Championship, and there were hopes that the chance to jump in towards the top would prompt big clubs, and specifically Manchester United, to join the increasingly profitable and marketable game.Like United, Southampton had scrapped their women’s team in 2005, though in their case it coincided with the relegation of the men’s team from the Premier League. Both relaunched a senior side for the 2018-19 season and bid for the Championship. United were granted a licence by the FA that meant they flew straight into the second tier. But Southampton missed out.Some speculated over whether the will to stick to their club’s launch would still be there should they have to climb from the fifth tier, but just after they were deemed to have not met the entry criteria for the Championship, they appointed the former England international Spacey-Cale as manager. Poaching the 91-capped forward from the FA was a statement move.“When I came in we had just lost the opportunity for a licence,” she says. “The club did appeal, but they were straight away saying that whatever happens we want to have this programme, we want a successful women’s team as part of Southampton football club.” Like United, in their first season Southampton FC won promotion – and they are on course for another, as they are unbeaten in the National League Division One, South West. “For me, there was never any scepticism and even if there was then that’s certainly in the past, because what the club has done shows how much they support what we want to achieve here,” Spacey-Cale says of the perception that some clubs may be frustrated at their entry as big-spenders in the lower leagues.“Other clubs have gone through this. When there wasn’t a lot of money for the women’s game, other clubs have shut down teams and now they’re coming back. Charlton are back in the Championship, Fulham have a team again, Man United did, and are now in the WSL.“It’s a situation that you can’t control but you can look to the future and be positive about it. There’s an appetite for the women’s game now and we want to be a part of that now and for the future.”On arrival, Spacey-Cale was given a “blank piece of paper” to mould Southampton FC’s new programme. “I’m a very positive person so if I didn’t believe we had an opportunity to climb through the leagues then I might not be sitting here today,” says the 53-year-old. “We’ve got a young squad, a tier one Regional Talent Club that is transitioning players through from the under-16s to the development squad and some into the first team, so we’ve got real clear pathways and not having a Championship licence has given us the opportunity to build that.“Now we’ve got a real sustainable pathway fully supported by the club that says that you can come into Southampton as a nine-year-old and hopefully one day be playing in the Super League.”Continuing their FA Cup run would be a bonus, but the focus is on the league and getting to a position where they, like Coventry United and other tier one and two clubs, are entering at the fourth round instead of battling their way to it. “Tier three we’ve played and beaten in the last couple of rounds. We want to feel that every week next year, so promotion is key. And now we’ve got an opportunity to go up a level and play a team that got promoted out of that last year.”Closest to Southampton FC in the league, confusingly, are another Southampton team – Southampton Women’s FC, who are eight-times FA Cup winners and have also reached the last 32 of the competition. They play against the Championship side Crystal Palace on Sunday.“What’s great is that the two teams from Southampton are showing what Hampshire is all about,” says Spacey-Cale diplomatically. “It’s a fantastic hotbed of talent for women’s football. Our aim is to be promoted, and to do that we have to win the league. It’s one team that goes up, so that’s our aim.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ac39616673df9d55be7a387d6f5fa35f54f6678/0_221_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=883668ffc70b75d88a585bb7ca6eb76f","title":"brentford v leicester fa cup fourth round live","story":"90 min +2: Marcondes finds a second wind and dribbles down the right. But Fuchs is on hand to put a stop to his gallop.90 min +1: Yearwood tries to drive Brentford forward, but his fizzed pass towards Marcondes pings off the tired attacker.90 min: There will be three added minutes.88 min: Maddison slides one down the right for Justin, who shuttles the ball on for Albrighton. He’s in plenty of space, but with the hosts light at the back, hoicks a dreadful cross deep into the stand.87 min: Not from this corner, no. Racic has another whack at goal, but this one isn’t so graceful, and the ball flies harmlessly into the crowd behind.86 min: Racic sprays a pass down the left for Henry, whose low cross is hacked out for a corner by Soyuncu. Can Brentford find the equaliser their second-half efforts deserve?84 min: Racic meets Marcondes’s corner from the right with a sensational volley. It’s heading in, but Ward tips over magnificently. And from the next corner, Henry hooks in from the left, Mbeumo coming in from the other side and slamming home! Griffin Park erupts. But the flag goes up, correctly, for offside.83 min: Marcondes crosses from the left. Fuchs ducks under it, in order to let the ball out for a goal kick. But the referee thinks he’s taken a touch and awards a corner. From which ...82 min: A last throw of the dice by Thomas Frank. Valencia is replaced by Mbeumo.81 min: Not a lot going on. It’s very flat. Leicester will be happy enough as the clock ticks down.79 min: Another corner for Leicester, Maddison to take out on the right. It leads to a shanked long-range effort by Praet. Henry launches a quick counter, creaming a pass down the left that initially looks to have sprung Dervisoglu clear. But the flag correctly pops up for offside.78 min: Albrighton’s corner is a non-event. Then Gray is replaced by Maddison. It’s fair to say the rhythm of this match has been totally broken.77 min: Thompson can’t continue. A power bar can’t restore his energy levels. Henry comes on in his stead.76 min: Before the corner can be taken, Thompson is treated for cramp.75 min: So having said that, Perez feeds Justin down the right. The wing back beats Thompson, checks back, and curls a shot towards the bottom left. It’s deflected out for a corner.73 min: Leicester ping it around at high speed in the middle of the park, but don’t go anywhere. Their early domination seems a long time ago.71 min: A nice dummy by the newcomer Dewsbury-Hall sends Praet into acres down the left. Praet’s pullback finds Choudhury, who instead of shooting from the edge of the area passes to nobody in particular. Brentford clear.70 min: Yearwood bustles down the middle and slips a pass wide right for Dasilva, who blooters a witless effort deep into the stand. Not sure whether that was an attempt at a cross or a shot. Either way: no.68 min: Leicester replace their goalscorer Iheanacho with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, making his senior debut.66 min: Scrappy again. There’s been a strange ebb and flow to this match.64 min: This is a great cup tie now. Marcondes nearly latches onto a long pass, but Ward comes right to the edge of his area to clear. Brentford are asking some serious questions now.62 min: Brentford hit the post! Marcondes, out on the left, curls the ball low into the mixer. It evades everyone, and bounces off the bottom of the right-hand stick. The ball rolls back across the face of goal, but Fuchs is on hand to clear, skilfully so with Valencia lurking.61 min: Yearwood embarks on an Andy Robertsonesque closing-down spree. He forces Leicester all the way back to Ward, who slices clear. That got the crowd going, if nothing else.59 min: A chance to try again from pretty much the same spot, as Perez clatters into the back of Valencia. Da Silva takes, looping towards the back post. Racic rises highest, but can only head the ball straight up into the air, allowing Ward to step in. The keeper doesn’t claim, but only because he’s fouled by Racic. Pressure off.57 min: Marcondes tries a trick play, shaping to hoick the ball into the mixer but slipping a pass down the left. It’s intended for Zamburek, but it’s a real clanker, and is easily snaffled by Iheanacho. What a waste. 56 min: Dervisoglu spins out of a tight spot in balletic fashion. A lovely piece of skill. Leicester are suddenly on the back foot, and Gray is panicked into clipping Zamburek from behind. A free kick out on the left. Brentford load the box.54 min: Zamburek loses control of both legs, the ball clattering between them in the slapstick style. A moment that would be perfectly soundtracked by a xylophone trill. That allows Perez to tear up the other end and win a corner. Albrighton takes, sending the ball towards nobody in particular.52 min: One of those scrappy periods.50 min: Dervisoglu, out on the right, loops a glorious diagonal pass towards Valencia, who enters the Leicester box before screaming a rising shot across the face of goal and wide. He should at least have hit the target. A great chance gone by.49 min: Acres of space for Perez, who slips the ball right for Iheanacho. The ball’s shuttled on to Justin, who reaches the byline and slaps a low cross straight into the hands of Daniels. For a second there, Brentford were opened up. Justin should have done better.48 min: Marcondes hits it deep. Too deep.47 min: Valencia again dribbles down the right, slipping Roerslev in on the overlap. Roerslev wins a corner, which Marcondes will take.46 min: Brentford are immediately on the attack, Valencia forcing a throw deep in Leicester territory on the right. The ball’s flung straight to a blue shirt, and Leicester clear. Still, an early statement of intent by the home side.And we’re back! Brentford get the ball rolling for the second half. One change for the home side: Mokotjo isn’t able to continue, on account of that knock late in the first half, so he’s replaced by Dasilva.Half-time entertainment. A reminder that more than one Thomas Frank is available.There’s just time for Marcondes to send a dipping effort over the bar from 25 yards. And that’s that for the first half. Brentford, after an incredibly shaky start, would have taken this scoreline after four minutes they’d have snatched your hand off, in fact. But they’ve since gathered themselves. They’re still right in this tie. More soon!45 min: Mokotjo comes off worst in a 50-50 with Morgan. He’s limping a bit. Fortunately the whistle will be blown in 60 seconds.44 min: Mokotjo floats a diagonal ball into the Leicester box from the right. Marcondes springs the Leicester trap, but the ball’s a little bit too high and it skims off the top of his head. Then Leicester go straight up the other end and nearly make it two, Perez slamming a shot straight at Daniels, Gray recycling the ball for Albrighton to head over. End-to-end fun.42 min: Gray sashays in from the left and one-twos with Perez. He thinks about shooting, but instead opts to feed Justin down the inside-right. He overhits the pass and it’s a goal kick. A sad end to a lovely move.40 min: Marcondes takes. Jeanvier, racing in, can’t quite get a head on it. Marcondes comes again, playing Valencia in down the right, but the flag goes up for offside. Brentford are beginning to threaten Leicester. Just a little, but small acorns and all that.39 min: Thompson works his way down the inside left and sends a bobbling shot towards the bottom right. It’s probably going wide, but Ward takes no risks and fingertips it out for a corner.37 min: Fuchs finds Gray on the edge of the area with a searching ball from the left. Gray’s shot is blocked. Leicester come again, Praet dropping a shoulder to make space down the left, then looking to plant a worldie of a curler into the top right. He gets it all wrong, and the ball goes sailing off into the stand again.35 min: An aimless hoof into the crowd is caught by a punter in a Norway bobble hat. He smiles quite a lot. A fan of Egil Olsen, perhaps.33 min: Albrighton strips Yearwood and strides towards the Brentford box, before sending a low drive inches wide of the left-hand post. Not sure Daniels was getting there. Leicester so close to doubling their lead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fac442aa39177389702c203570a0c7417012276e/0_144_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2553c45d34e96ce83c46cc8b4bc16f88","title":"fa cup fourth round clockwatch southampton tottenham coventry birmingham live","story":"Southampton v Tottenham: Christian Eriksen has been left out Tottenham’s squad, despite travelling with the team.

United need something better than that with the game entering the final five minutes.82 min: Hoping someone in the crowd has some Zapruder footage of the United ‘goal that never was’. Back and to the left. Back and to the left.79 min: The game is just quietening down as City protect their lead following Jill Scott’s first goal since 2018. Just when we thought it was 2-2, Jill Scott restores City’s two-goal advantage. A rather strange goal this. The ball is played back to the tall midfielder who hits a rather floaty shot from 20 yards which Earps is slow to react to. Was there a hidden deflection possibly? The lack of camera angles doesn’t help. 74 min: There’s no ideal camera angle to show whether the ball was over the line or not.72 min: Drama! United free-kick on the left. Wonderful delivery from Zelem and it’s prodded home at the far post by sub Lizzie Arnot. United celebrate but there’s no goalline technology here and the referee says no goal.

City press again and Hemp charges forward but overhits her cross.65 min: United definitely look sparkier since conceding the second goal. They have to up it, of course, and perhaps there’s also an element of City just sitting on their 2-0 lead.61 min: Good chance for United as Kirsty Hanson works space down the left with Stanway out of position. She drills an angled left-foot shot towards goal which Roebuck does well to tip over for a corner. Again, United can’t profit from the dead-ball situation.59 min: A switch for United as Lauren James comes on for Jane Ross. James got 14 goals in the top-flight last season (seven this term) so she definitely poses a threat.It’s Ellen White again! Great build-up play and what a finish from White. The ball is crossed from the left by Hemp and the striker gets across the defender, flicks out a foot and it flies into the goal. A great strike from a natural finisher and City have daylight.54 min: Roebuck parries the corner away somewhat unconvincingly and McManus, from just inside the six-yard box, nods wide when she could maybe have done better.53 min: Decent spin and shot from Groenen near the City penalty spot. It’s blocked by Bonner and the ball goes for another United corner. Groenen needs treatment after being caught whilst taking the shot.51 min: You get the sense that a second goal for City could be decisive as they concede very few and United haven’t had any real clear-cut chances. The hosts are still very much in it though and win a second corner of the half. This one is dealt with easily.49 min: Drama at either end. A jinking run by United’s Kirsty Smith ends with a thumping shot which is blocked. City then counter-attack and White plays in Wullaert. She cuts back inside the last defender and, with the goal gaping, pulls the trigger from eight yards but her left-foot effort drifts over the United bar. A golden chance for 2-0 goes begging.47 min: Early corner for United after good work by Groenen, who has been quiet so far. Zelem’s delivery is excellent and into a dangerous area but City have enough bodies back.The visitors then break upfield and Scott has a shot from the edge of the area charged down.United get the second 45 in play. Jill Scott is fine to carry on for City so no half-time changes for either team. Then again, Scott is rubbing her back so it could be a see how it goes scenario.Quick note: the draw for the fifth round of the FA Cup takes place on Monday.45+2: Cross from the left is cleared by Houghton and that’s the end of the first 45. City have looked the more composed side but their goal came from an error at the back, something the visitors have been guilty of themselves on more than one occasion. Classy finish by White though and that’s the goal that puts Cushing’s team in front.45+1: Scott returns and City return the ball to United.45 min: Break in play as Scott takes a knee in the lower back. She’s on the turf receiving treatment. Meanwhile, the board goes up to indicate two extra minutes in the first half.44 min: White almost charges down a backpass. Both sets of defenders are giving their respective managers kittens here!42 min: A bout of possession for City ends with a corner... or does it? No, the referee gives it the other way.39 min: City’s turn to press United now. The hosts can’t get out and the visitors win the ball back. The best chances so far - and, of course the goal - have come from defenders being put under pressure.37 min: Jane Ross pinches possession and crosses from the left but she can’t pick out Sigsworth and Stokes gets there first to clear. City continue to dangle a carrot for the alert United front players.36 min: Worth mentioning that both sides are in League Cup action on Wednesday night, with City taking on Arsenal and United facing Chelsea in the last four.35 min: United just need to get a foothold again here with City sniffing a second goal.32 min: Almost a quick follow-up from City as space opens up down the right but Wullaert’s thumping shot is beaten away by Earps."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6d3d5734ce375b527bba15e7478ddaf2d56a005/0_398_4128_2477/master/4128.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6cbebd63b86b697a1a122da12c4d21b2","title":"books bollywood and barbs the magic of the jaipur literature festival","story":"Critics may carp, but stellar lineups, celebrity sightings and swarming crowds make Jaipur the world’s biggest literary eventFor a country too often associated with poverty and bad news, the annual Jaipur literature festival is a matter of national pride. Not only because it is officially the world’s largest such gathering, but also because it has earned its place on the global literary map, even with a serious reading public still emerging in India.Where else in the world could you listen to Weijian Shan, author of Out of the Gobi, recall his childhood during China’s cultural revolution, when Mao urged students to beat their teachers to death? Or learn how the late war correspondent Marie Colvin had to drink Colonel Gaddafi’s guards under the table in order to secure an interview with him? Or hear biographer Benjamin Moser talk about Susan Sontag’s lifelong shame at being gay?Where else, in between absorbing such literary joys, could you eat a masala dosa in the dappled sunlight under an old banyan tree watching a soft breeze make the coloured bunting dance over the lawns of the Diggi Palace?Last year, half a million people came to Jaipur for the five-day event, prompting co-founder and historian William Dalrymple to say at Thursday’s opening: “At a time when people say the love for literature is dying, we are proof that it isn’t.”The festival’s organisers invariably pull off an amazing line-up: among those taking part this year are Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee, Howard Jacobson, Paul Muldoon, Simon Schama, Leila Slimani, Shashi Tharoor, Nicholas Coleridge, Forrest Gander, Asne Seierstadand Lemn Sisssay.The organisers have also highlighted little-known or neglected areas of literature – books by Dalits and by Indian women, poetry, regional writing – providing a platform that simply wasn’t available before. That high-profile literary agents attend only makes it more meaningful.It has become fashionable to knock the festival for being ruined by its own success. Some of the gripes are understandable. The teeming crowds, particularly at weekends, have made for scenes you might see on an Indian train platform. The determination to be democratic and allow anyone to come in for free has proved problematic – if only from a security perspective.Some feel commercialism has gradually crept in, with too many stalls selling merchandise, others complain of writers being corralled away from the hoi polloi in their lounges when they had once mingled and eaten among the crowds. In the queues for delicious masala chai served in clay cups, visitors had been able to chat to famous authors. Vikram Seth was once spotted sitting on the ground because there was no free seat.The commercialisation continues. Stalls selling trinkets and clothes now begin on the road that leads to Diggi Palace, rather than inside the venue. The crowds are as big as ever. While weekdays are very pleasant, at the weekend the place turns into a literary version of the Kumbh Mela pilgrimage: the swarming crowds are such that your feet don’t touch the ground as you are carried along. The intimacy of the early years has gone the festival is now a truly titanic affair.But whatever barbs are thrown at the event, it remains the greatest literary show on Earth. In five days there are more than 200 sessions, authors from 20 countries and literature in more than 25 languages.It’s all too rare that India does an event well, never mind an event marked on the international cultural calendar. Jaipur is superbly organised, with excellently curated music and a warm, good-natured atmosphere.“The festival has carved out a place for itself in the world. Everyone is in awe of it,” said Rajasthan’s chief minister Ashok Gehlot this week.People from all over the world converge on the event – “I can’t cope with the rest of the year until I’ve had my Jaipur fix,” one person was overheard to remark – and its freshness is no doubt a factor. Like serious reading itself among the Indian public, it is a work in progress. Homes in the country rarely contain books, and a volume that sells 8,000 copies is regarded as a bestseller. The most popular genre remains the self-help book.That’s why there is none of the jaded cynicism or “seen it all” ennui of western literary audiences. People here are eager and enthusiastic. Indians, particularly in small towns, are starved of culture and long for knowledge and ideas. So prestigious is the Jaipur “brand” that it has inspired literary festivals in cities and even small towns all over India, from Kerala in the south to Nainital in the north.Of course, the nouveau riche from Delhi also come to Jaipur “to be seen” at a highbrow event and win some intellectual brownie points. They talk loudly, eat, drink, take selfies, and go home without attending a single session.It is also the annual haunt of young men from Jaipur, who turn up in leather jackets with slicked-back hair, showing off their girlfriends (or hoping to find one). And, of course, for many other local people, it is a chance to people-watch and rub shoulders with the elite and perhaps even glimpse a Bollywood star.But does any of this matter when you are comfortably seated inside one of the colourful tents, the effulgence of the sun making the colours glow, listening to the finest of minds? No. It’s simply magic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26d77c9a350bd77478321525a09eed8cc6af38f3/0_517_2583_1550/master/2583.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcc7368196d4b681607e118575c12f79","title":"how has your workplace treated bereaved parents","story":"As paid leave for bereaved parents is being introduced under Jack’s Law, we want to hear what parents experienced at work after they lost a childBereaved parents are now entitled to two weeks’ paid leave from work under the new Jack’s Law.We want to hear from bereaved parents who had to juggle the grief, trauma and practicalities of their child’s death with the demands of their employers.

From the plants you buy – and where you buy them – to the gardens you visit, the platform has driven a profound change in the tastes and habits of even established gardeners, not to mention encouraging a new generation of green fingers.Plants have been inspiring artists for hundreds of years, so they are well suited to the photo app. A younger generation (urban, cash-strapped, Insta-obsessed and renting) are driving houseplant sales, sharing pictures of their plant babies instead of the human ones they can’t afford. From the dramatic structure of mother-in-law’s tongue to blousy tea roses, you can say a lot about your taste through the species you share. Connecting with nature reduces stress, much needed in these chaotic times even bursts of online greenery, amid Instagram’s sometimes frantic commercialism, are a tonic.Certain plants look better on Instagram than others: anything with unusual leaf shapes and textures, such as the Chinese money plant, (Pilea peperomioides), trailing hearts (Ceropegia woodii), and the swiss cheese plant (Monstera deliciosa) anything especially oversized, variegated or brightly coloured, such as the hot-pink patterned leaves of philodendron ‘Pink Princess’ and anything that would fill a maximalist display, such as spider plants and string-of-pearls (see @thesill, @cultivatedbychristin, @graceandthorn, @littleandlush for inspiration). Online stardom has meant a growth in the popularity of appealing varieties, including plants that haven’t been in demand since the 1970s. Traditional nurseries are finding it hard to keep up with demand. This means Instagram-friendly plants are big business. Take the aforementioned philodendron ‘Pink Princess’. “These are so difficult to get hold of and grow so slowly that the prices are hugely inflated tiny cuttings go for £120 or more,” says Claire Ransom, founder of the online nursery, Lazy Flora. “This creates an almost mythical status on Instagram.”A trawl through Etsy, the online marketplace, confirms these eye-watering price tags: two small string of hearts plants for £69.99 heart-shaped hoyas for £52 and a variegated monstera for more than £300. They can, however, be bought for much less.When Ransom moved into a flat with outdoor space, she realised how hard it was to find the right plants. “I didn’t have a car, so getting to and from a big garden centre was a challenge,” she says. “If I managed to get a lift, the selection of plants was often poor. At smaller boutiques closer to home, plants were expensive.”So in 2017 Ransom set up Lazy Flora, one of a new breed of online plant subscription services that feed the growing appetite for houseplants. “Instagram is vital to our business,” she says. “It’s a great way to connect with people directly, and to learn about trends. One of the advantages of a subscription is that we know numbers ahead of time, so we can order the exact number of plants each month.”Ransom selects varieties based on how photogenic they are. “Leaves with patterns or interesting shapes, such as those on fittonia or burro’s tail (Sedum morganianum), or the rainbow-like colours of succulents always do well,” she says. “If our customers can take good pictures and share them on social media, that’s great for us. We sell more plants when customers can focus on closeups of the leaves or flowers, such as red calathea or a flower-laden Christmas cactus.” If Instagram favours the photogenic, it’s a brutal time for less attractive varieties. “Palms are an elegant and sturdy choice for low-light homes, but because of their lack of social media wow (they are hard to photograph because the leaves can appear messy, and aren’t particularly impactful) they have become less popular over the last 18 months,” says Paul Holt, creative director at N1 Garden Centres in London.Like fashion and interiors, plants are now at the whim of changing trends. While tropical banana leaves and pineapples used to figure large on Instagram, they hit critical mass on the high street and have been replaced by monstera and succulents. Also, large plants are hard to fit into a small rented flat, and easy to kill if not cared for in a chilly garden – many Instagram plant fans are, after all, still new to gardening and learning as they grow.Flower shows have also learned how to attract younger visitors and generate social media hype: they have introduced houseplant displays, dramatic backdrops such as flower walls and mass planting schemes, and invited influencers such as Estée Lalonde (more than 700k Instagram followers) and Joe Sugg (5.5m followers) to document events. “The RHS Instagram account grew by 20,000 followers over the first three days of RHS Chelsea this year,” says Rose Gore Browne, Chelsea flower show’s manager. The most popular posts under the hashtag #RHSChelsea were big, bright flowers – peonies, alliums and roses. Gardening has never been trendier, and the industry is having to apply green fingers to Instagram’s pulse and respond in record time. “It’s certainly strange for me,” says Lazy Flora’s Ransom, “because no one was interested in plants for a while and I’m suddenly doing a job that’s in fashion.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2f0b4d6cb19701ecd35a71a8583e9c23324d029/0_24_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49cd81146ccc7222e27ceb700feb6282","title":"vegan veganism exotic mushrooms shiitake meat substitute","story":"In Ormskirk, Lancashire, John Dorrian is busy checking the growth of the nine tonnes of shiitake mushrooms and six tonnes of oyster mushrooms he grows each week in 26 separate rooms. While this might sound like a huge haul of fungi, it’s nothing compared to what Dorrian has planned for his business, Smithy Mushrooms, in the months ahead. “We’ve been growing oyster mushrooms here for more than 25 years but have never had demand like we’re seeing now,” he says.Sales of little-known, exotic mushrooms have soared as a result of the explosion of the plant-based food revolution, with UK growers seeking new ways to keep up with all-year-round demand that now extends well beyond “veganuary”.Writer and author Shirley Conran famously declared in 1975 that life was “too short to stuff a mushroom”. But today top chefs’ enthusiasm for varieties such as brown oyster cluster, king oyster and shiitake mushrooms as fleshy, savoury alternatives to meat – matched with easy-to-follow recipes – means that amateur cooks are turning to these exotic alternatives.Dorrian says demand for lesser-known varieties has risen sharply over the last two years, with the business now planning to expand its facilities in order to grow more varieties, including those typically imported from Asia. “Traditionally, when British consumers bought mushrooms it was the white ones or, if they were a bit braver, chestnut mushrooms,” Dorrian says. “But that’s all changing. “Exotic mushrooms are incredibly versatile and can be shredded to replicate pulled pork, thinly sliced to make kebab skewers and even sliced to make scallops.”The interest in plant-based food has had a major impact on sales, Dorrian added, and the business – with major investment from Korea-based car company Hyundai – will shortly apply for planning permission for a new purpose-built farm to allow it to grow more shiitake mushrooms. Another is in the pipeline next year to cultivate king oyster mushrooms that are generally imported from South Korea. Tesco has been pushing its fungi offerings via Derek Sarno – known in the industry as the “Mushroom King” – who has created the supermarket’s plant-based food ranges. “Brown oyster cluster and king oyster mushrooms offer such a meaty texture and versatility that they can be adapted to replicate just about any meat dish, making them the perfect ingredient for plant-based cooking,” he said. “They’re delicious on their own but the mild flavours and fibrous consistency easily absorbs whatever herbs, spice blends or sauces you choose to use – from Texan BBQ, Indian, Pan-Asian to classic British comfort foods. I’ve been working with them for many years, and thanks to their incredible taste and versatility they have become a cornerstone of my recipes.”Among major chefs banging the drum for mushrooms is Yotam Ottolenghi, who has created a vegan equivalent of steak and mash featuring roasted portobello mushrooms as its showstopping main ingredient, and Simon Rimmer on Channel 4’s Sunday Brunch programme.At London’s Borough Market, mushroom displays change through the year. David Matchett, head of food policy development, said: “When British wild mushrooms are in season, that’s what you’ll find here, in all their stunning ersity. At other times, like now, our traders will import a wide variety of wild mushrooms from wherever they’re in season and at their best, currently Portugal, which is one of the few places in Europe warm enough for wild mushrooms at the moment.”Meanwhile a new campaign is being launched this month called Mushroom Miles – part of the Miles Better initiative to highlight the impact shopping closer to home has on the environment – urging shoppers to support growers based in UK and Ireland, rather than adding food miles of those imported from Poland and Asia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/380e89aa5830c6ad9582fa009a3918738785794b/0_56_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f60ec01e0db76545d9e624c40f584922","title":"black country new road yes manchester live review sunglasses","story":"Yes, ManchesterCerebral, eclectic and occasionally wordy, the gnarly rock of Black Country, New Road is a richly Generation Z experienceThere are, apparently, seven people on stage, making what sounds like eastern Mediterranean rave music. The lighting (of which there is little) and the dry ice (more copious) help to wrap Black Country, New Road in a haze of unreality.Through the fog, the outline of a violin and the shape of a saxophone are visible some silhouetted figures stand, some crouch. Eventually, one of the guitarists in BCNR begins intoning something. He builds to a holler and the band plunge into a lacerating workout, drawn mostly from early 90s post-hardcore punk. Beer flies past. Out of the anguish and feedback there eventually emerges the sweetest of melodies, on which violin and sax double up and keyboards provide icy atmospherics.Most of Black Country, New Road’s tracks follow this pattern of resisting pattern, developing over several minutes breaking down, pulling back together – a study in tension and release held to account by a fantastically able drummer. While the constituent parts of this mesmerising din are easily picked out – gnarly math-rock, like that of BCNR’s fellow travellers Black Midi, contemporary classical, jazz, klezmer – the effrontery of having all this music, all at once, feels genuinely daring. It also feels, thrillingly, like it might even take off this year.Black Country, New Road’s thoughtful, idiosyncratic fusions first gained traction thanks to a tenure at a London pub venue called the Windmill in Brixton, crucible of Fat White Family and many others. (In late December, BCNR joined forces on stage with Black Midi for a Black Midi, New Road special, where the conjoined bands played Wham! and Mariah Carey covers.)Although BCNR are largely instrumental, their coverage thus far has tended to focus on the words of guitarist Wood. When his lyrics are present, they are highly writerly – full of elliptical narratives and changing perspectives – but are also studded with trashy pop culture references and curdled tales of bad sex. Wood told one interviewer recently that he was a virgin an element of playing with the band’s public persona may be at work here. (“Fuck me like you mean it this time, Isaac!” runs one of Wood’s lyrics.) The chorus of Sunglasses, their best-known tune, is a perfectly turned Gen-Z rallying cry. “I’m more than adequate!” shouts Wood. “Leave Kanye out of this! Leave your sertraline in the cabinet!”By contrast, Athen’s, France (the possessive is intentional) tells the tale of failed intimacy with an Ariana Grande fan the lyrics quote Phoebe Bridgers’s Motion Sickness. The unreleased, but well-gigged Wet Sheets follows a dream Wood’s narrator has about Charli XCX taking a Svengali-like interest in his work. There are songs about fires at science fairs, and feeling out of step with the world. “Everybody’s coming up, I guess I’m late to the party,” notes Wood, several minutes into Opus, another pell-mell eastern Med bop.Manchester audiences in particular appreciate these sorts of well-turned non sequiturs, and the spirit of the Fall lurks just offstage. More obscurely, there is the little-known 90s British outfit Joeyfat, who originally adapted the Slint sound to a more arch British tone. And BCNR are audibly British – they hail from Cambridge, largely, and most have known one another since secondary school. “I become her father,” runs one of Wood’s scenarios, “And complain of mediocre theatre in the daytime‚ and ice in single malt whisky at night Of rising skirt hems‚ lowering IQs, and things just aren’t built like they used to be.” He pauses. “The absolute pinnacle of British engineering!”All these antecedents are moot, however, because the overall feeling at these two excellent gigs – the first in Yes’s Pink Room, and a second, after-hours set in the basement because the Pink Room sold out very quickly – resembles that of contemporary London jazz nights out, where a moshpit shouting along to a sax line is standard practice.As it is, the four men and three women making this racket barely move around, even as crowdsurfers are held aloft by the basement audience. Such is the squeeze that at least four members of BCNR – violin player Georgia Ellery, bassist Tyler Hyde, guitarist Luke Mark and Wood – all play side-on to the crowd, their physical limitations adding to the tension. They have two-and-a-half front-people: all the way over to the left, Wood resists the role. It falls to sax player Lewis Evans to provide a focal point. Ellery is at the front too, surveying the crowd coolly. There are cries of “Tyler!” – Hyde, daughter of Underworld’s Karl, studies at Manchester’s art school, while a significant proportion of her bandmates have done time at the Guildhall School in London.These are, ultimately, 21-year-olds making music for other 21-year-olds, for whom genre is a superseded hang-up. Bucking the culture of instant gratification, however, BCNR’s union of styles and emotions works. Irresolute and open-ended, it is somehow triumphal, a full-court press of dread and beauty, positively rewarding close attention and resisting easy analysis.

Now she is faced with a settlement offer that she believes would allow him to escape blame for the alleged assaults. Also today: Lily Kuo on the spread of the deadly coronavirus in ChinaThe actor, model and writer Zoë Brock was on a retreat in the New Zealand bush in 2017 when an email pinged into her inbox. It was from a friend sending a link to a breaking news story of allegations against Harvey Weinstein. The claims from several women against the film producer were eerily familiar to an incident that Brock alleges happened to her. This week, Weinstein goes on trial charged with rape and sexual assault. But for dozens of women with claims against him, their only recourse is to civil courts.

I couldn’t believe it. But I feel sad, I really love Britain. I love this country, I like the way they give you a chance to succeed. But this is, forgive my language, a kick in the balls. I have been here for 23 years, I pay tax, I pay VAT, I employ 60 people, but this is saying ‘sorry, tough, we do not want you’.”He said he had never heard of the settled status scheme which was launched last March.“I applied for permanent residency because a friend recommended it. He has a French wife and he said she got it no problem so that’s what I did.”The chef, who held two Michelin stars at his restaurant Hibiscus in London before taking over Bibendum, shared part of the letter from the Home Office with his 27,000 followers on Instagram“They have my records, they could see I was French. If this was the wrong thing to do somebody should tell me. Nobody told me I should apply for settled status, even when I went to the Home Office in person to get my photo taken.“You have people there who can’t answer questions. When I asked how long it would take, what was next, they couldn’t answer. You are made feel unwelcome.“After 23 years you feel like you are being taken for granted and they take your tax and then the robot just says ‘no’,” Bosi said. “This is the inhumanity of the government.”He has lived in the UK since 1997 and has two children with another on the way.He said if he had received the letter two years ago, before he invested his money in Bibendum, he would probably have left the country.His letter told him that he had not “provided adequate evidence to show that you have been a qualified person” to remain and could reapply providing five years worth of P60 tax records, rather than the one P60 that he had supplied.It also gives the impression that the settled status application process has yet to be launched, telling him at the end of what appears to be a templated letter that “a new scheme for EU citizens” will be “announced in due course”.One legal expert said it was a failure of communication by the government and more must be done to raise awareness under the Brexit withdrawal agreement about to be ratified.“They should have at least updated their letter to those applying for permanent residence to make them aware of the settled status scheme,” said Steve Peers, a professor of EU law at the University of Essex.“There is an obligation under the withdrawal agreement to publicise the citizens’ rights rules and this seems to be an obvious failure, if people are still misunderstanding this.”The Home Office launched the settled status scheme last March after huge controversy over EU citizens being threatened with removal after applying for permanent residency.The scheme was designed to be easy and simple and so far the department appears to have had major success with 2.7m applications in less than a year.A Home Office spokesperson said the chef had “made an application for a permanent residence card – something which EU citizens living in the UK are not required or encouraged to do. His application for permanent residence was not successful because he did not provide sufficient evidence to show he met the criteria.”They added: “We have spoken to him to help him to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme, which has already guaranteed the rights of over 2.5 million people. It’s free, there is plenty of support available online, on the phone or in person and EU citizens and their families have until 30 June 2021 to apply.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31136ce998a49f288e41848af6585f1a0e7357c/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77932bb35b0fe9163ffbbf85ebb3272b","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youMore than 1,280 infected and 18 cities in lockdown in China as officials try to stem spread of virus which has reached Europe, the US and Australia.

Chaired by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, it was called to ensure appropriate measures were in place to deal with the virus if it does spread to Britain. However Whitty said that the threat of the virus entering the UK has not been totally eradicated as medics were still waiting for the results of checks on several other people.Samples of between 10 and 20 other suspected carriers of the virus are being analysed, the  understands.On Friday night the first cases were reported in Europe with France saying it had identified three instances of the virus. All had visited China.UK government officials are systematically working through every passenger who has arrived from Wuhan over the past 14 days – the incubation period for the virus – and checking up on their health.The complex task involves cooperation between airlines, the Department of Health and the Border Force: and the most recent arrivals will be checked first.While the government emphasised that the risk to the public was limited Prof Paul Cosford, emeritus medical director at Public Health England (PHE), said it was still “early days” in the course of the virus, and that it is “highly likely” that cases would be seen in the UK.But he stressed that most of those affected abroad are making a good recovery. In an earlier interview with the Today programme, Cosford said that contingency plans were ready should cases be detected.“I think it’s highly likely that we will have cases in the UK, and of course every so often we do get new infections coming from the animal kingdom such as this one,” he said.Some public health experts privately fear that the public is at risk of becoming unduly worried about the virus and believe that the government or PHE should take steps to provide reassurance.There is also concern that some media outlets are exaggerating the risk posed by Chinese students.From Saturday the Department of Health and Social Care will publish figures every day for the number of suspected cases across the UK. But if a positive case is identified, the chief medical officer of whichever of the four home nations it emerges in will make that announcement.The Scottish government confirmed later on Friday afternoon that results for two of the five patients in Scotland tested for Coronavirus have come back negative, while it was understood that another patient was tested at Belfast’s Royal Victoria hospital.Two of those tested in Scotland had been diagnosed with flu after travelling to Wuhan in China – the origin of the global outbreak. Downing Street said four out of five suspected cases in Scotland were believed to involve Chinese nationals. Late on Friday the official death toll in China rose to 41 with more than 1,000 confirmed cases.A crucial question for how the outbreak will unfold is how contagious the virus is. Scientists around the world are trying to establish how many people, on average, each infected person will pass the virus on to, a number known as R0 in epidemiology. If this number is more than one, an epidemic will grow and if less than one it will fizzle out.An analysis posted online on Friday by scientists from Lancaster University, puts R0 for the new coronavirus at 3.8 and estimates that should the epidemic continue unabated, there could be 191,529 infections by 4 February.The paper also suggests that travel restrictions from and to Wuhan city are unlikely to be effective in halting transmission across China.In the UK universities began taking measures to stop the spread of the virus warning students considering travelling home to China to celebrate Chinese new year that they risk being quarantined on their return. Medical experts also remained at every UK airport with information on the virus being given to passengers returning from China.Elsewhere, private schools were also gearing with contingency plans for overseas pupils who were unable or unwilling to return home for upcoming holidays. China sends more pupils to UK fee-paying schools than any other country.While there is “no immediate cause for concern” the situation needs to be closely monitored, independent school groups said, adding that schools should “err on the side of caution” to minimise risks to staff and students.This came as a British grandmother, Veronica Theobald, told how she was trapped in Wuhan and had been unable to return home.The 81-year-old from Lancaster, who suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, had not been able to go outside for more than a week for fear of falling ill.Her grandson, Kharn Lambert, who has lived in the city for five years, said she was due to fly back to the UK on Monday. However, her return was cancelled after the city was placed on lockdown.Lambert, a PE teacher, said: “There is no knowing how long she will have to stay here.“I do worry if I have to go out for whatever reason that I will bring something back into the house and she will become infected and fall ill.“My family at home are extremely concerned about her, but I’m trying hard to reassure them that I am taking the best care of her as I can.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c58350a0e73d29ae4a86c642dfe1e52154e4cbe/0_476_7136_4281/master/7136.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3565c61eed01c59238bed2bfaaebb4ba","title":"has physicists gravity theory solved impossible dark energy riddle","story":"Prof Claudia de Rham’s ‘massive gravity’ theory could explain why universe expansion is acceleratingCosmologists don’t enter their profession to tackle the easy questions, but there is one paradox that has reached staggering proportions.Since the big bang, the universe has been expanding, but the known laws of physics suggest that the inward tug of gravity should be slowing down this expansion. In reality, though, the universe is ballooning at an accelerating rate.“It’s the big elephant in the room,” says Prof Claudia de Rham, a theoretical physicist at Imperial College. “It’s very frustrating.”Change could be afoot. De Rham has pioneered a radical theory that could hold the key to why the universe is expanding faster and faster and explain the nature of dark energy. The theory, known as massive gravity, modifies Einstein’s general relativity, positing that the hypothetical particles (gravitons) that mediate the gravitational force themselves have a mass. In Einstein’s version, gravitons are assumed to be massless.If gravitons have a mass, then gravity is expected to have a weaker influence on very large distance scales, which could explain why the expansion of the universe has not been reined in.“One possibility is that you may not need to have dark energy – or rather, gravity itself fulfils that role,” says De Rham.The work marks a breakthrough in a century-long quest to build a working theory of massive gravity. Despite successive efforts, previous versions of the theory had the unfortunate feature of predicting the instantaneous decay of every particle in the universe – an intractable issue that mathematicians refer to as a “ghost”.“Very clever people had worked on this and the arguments were very compelling,” says De Rham. “People thought it would be impossible to make it work.”Not deterred by slim odds of success – she previously trained as a pilot and made it through several stages of the European Space Agency’s astronaut selection process – De Rham entered the fray. But in 2011, when De Rham and her collaborators, Gregory Gabadadze from New York University and Andrew Tolley from Imperial College London, published a landmark paper on massive gravity, the response was swift and hostile.“People have their egos,” she says. “If you say ‘Well actually what you did 40 years ago wasn’t quite right’, they’re not going to say ‘Let’s talk about it’.”“It was very tough. For five or six years there was a limbo state where arguments were going back and forth.”In the end, the theory stood up and has been gaining traction in the past decade. “That’s what science does. At the end there’s a result based on maths and logic,” De Rham says. “If one is equal to one, we can all agree on that. Maths don’t lie.”In the latest acknowledgement of the breakthrough, De Rham was announced last week as recipient of the $100,000 (£75,000) Blavatnik Award for Young Scientists, two years after winning the Adams prize, one of the University of Cambridge’s oldest and most prestigious awards.De Rham is quick to point out that at this stage, massive gravity is still just a theory. Mathematically it checks out, but we don’t know whether it reflects empirical reality. But with the advent of gravitational wave astronomy, it will be possible to test predictions of the theory over the next decade and beyond.“It would be amazing if it was shown to be right,” she says. “That may or may not happen, but what will happen is that we’ll have a much better fundamental understanding of gravity and that’s just something so deep, it’s one of the big questions today.”De Rham’s more recent work covers other aspects of gravity. She is interested in the speed of gravity, which has never been directly measured and which theory predicts could in some circumstances be faster than light. She is also investigating whether gravity, like light, moves at different speeds through different materials. If it does, gravitational rainbows would exist that might be viewable with gravitational wave telescopes.As a new generation of gravitational wave observatories, such as Esa’s space-based observatory, Lisa, start gathering faint signals from the cosmos in the next decade, De Rham hopes to close in on some answers. “It’s going to be such a high level of science that we can do,” says De Rham. “It’s beautiful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/695e5f4332f1285b4ec0cf3a3dc3db3bf407490d/181_0_3241_1944/master/3241.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3114639861988be6ac84a5fbea4db38","title":"what is the coronavirus wuhan china virus symptoms","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the China virus and at what point should you go to the doctor?It is a novel coronavirus – that is to say, a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city, which also sold live and newly slaughtered animals. New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are examples.The virus causes pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died are known to have been already in poor health.Human to human transmission has been confirmed by China’s national health commission. As of 24 January the Chinese authorities had acknowledged more than 1,000 cases and 41 deaths. In the past week, the number of confirmed infections has more than tripled and cases have been found in 13 provinces, as well as the municipalities Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin. The virus has also been confirmed outside China, in Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam. There have not been any confirmed cases in the UK at present, with the 14 people tested for the virus all proving negative. The actual number to have contracted the virus could be far higher as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by WHO experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be 4,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 1,000 and 9,700.There were fears that the coronavirus might spread more widely during the week-long lunar new year holidays, which start on 24 January, when millions of Chinese travel home to celebrate, but the festivities have largely been cancelled and Wuhan and other Chinese cities are in lockdown. At the moment, it appears that people in poor health are at greatest risk, as is always the case with flu. A key concern is the range of severity of symptoms – some people appear to suffer only mild illness while others are becoming severely ill. This makes it more difficult to establish the true numbers infected and the extent of transmission between people. But the authorities will be keen to stop the spread and will be anxious that the virus could become more potent than it so far appears.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The NHS advises that there is generally no need to visit a doctor for a cough unless it is persistent or you are having other symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing or you feel very unwell.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. It increases the likelihood that the World Health Organization will declare the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on Thursday evening. The key concerns are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.Healthcare workers could be at risk if they unexpectedly came across someone with respiratory symptoms who had travelled to an affected region. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.

It was the same whenever a new reporter came into the Manchester crown courtroom and stared into the dock. Sitting there, smiling, between three hulking security guards, was a small man with thick-rimmed hipster glasses, playing with the shiny, shoulder-length hair he had not cut since his arrest in June 2017. Him? That’s Britain’s worst rapist? Predators come in all shapes and sizes, but Sinaga’s “worst ever” billing was hard to square with the boyish figure in the lumberjack shirt, scribbling notes behind the bulletproof glass as a stream of nervous young men went into the witness box to testify against him. was present at three out of Sinaga’s four trials, and Sinaga often seemed to be enjoying himself. He would cock his head to one side, as if studying a nature documentary, as he watched videos of himself raping dozens of men who had made the mistake of going back to his flat after a drunken night out. The prosecution tried to persuade the judge, Suzanne Goddard QC, that Sinaga didn’t need to see the films he had recorded on two iPhones, one perched on a dresser for long shots and another handheld for closeups. But Goddard reluctantly ruled that he should be allowed to see the evidence in order to mount what seemed to be a hopeless defence: that he wasn’t a sexual predator, but a harmless deviant. He just happened to be irresistible to young, usually straight men, who would pretend to be asleep as part of a sexual fantasy in which Sinaga would penetrate them on camera, sometimes for hours on end.There was no remorse. Were we in the presence of a psychopath? By the time the 36-year-old gave evidence in his fourth and final trial, before Christmas, he seemed to have persuaded himself that he was innocent. It was a “50 Shades Of Grey” thing, he said the sort of sex people have “underground”.When Sinaga first stood trial in May 2018, charged with drugging and raping 12 men, no journalist knew Greater Manchester police were trying to keep it quiet. They had already gathered enough evidence to suggest that Sinaga might have abused 195 men between 2005 and 2017, including before he even arrived in the UK on a student visa from Indonesia in 2007. More trials were inevitable. They had identified about 120 of the victims and 48 were eventually willing to testify, far too many for one jury to cope with. On one level, the jurors’ task was simple: they just had to decide whether the men in the videos were awake. But to do that, they had to watch hours and hours of explicit footage, much of it so traumatising that they were offered counselling once their trials were over.Sitting on the press benches, journalists could hear but not see the videos: snoring and sleep-talking, with occasional sirens.  got wind of the second trial in April last year, and attended the third and fourth in September and December. Reporting restrictions banned all media coverage to avoid prejudicing future juries, and we were barred from telling friends what we had seen and heard. It was hard in a case that felt very close to home. The locations where Sinaga preyed on his targets were horribly familiar, outside Manchester clubs where we’d had our own drunken nights out: Factory, Fifth Avenue, the Ritz, Gorilla. Crown court cases often seem distant when you’re a reporter: gang violence, domestic dramas, stupid decisions you feel quite sure you would never make yourself. But what happened to Sinaga’s victims could have happened to anyone who had been out and had too much to drink who had lost their phones and mates. If Reynhard Sinaga had invited you back to his flat, you might well calculate you’d be able to tackle him if he tried anything silly. He was only 5ft 7in. And anyway: he doesn’t look the type. Right?Some of Sinaga’s victims gave evidence in open court, shunning the offer of screens. They seemed to want to get a good look at him. Many said they didn’t remember meeting him, even when police knocked on their door several years later. They were adamant that detectives were barking up the wrong tree, until they were shown stills from the videos. The investigation team arranged to visit them at home with crisis counsellors from Saint Mary’s sexual assault referral centre. A police officer would begin by telling the men why they were there, and counsellors would start the therapy that continues today with 60 of Sinaga’s victims.“There were many different reactions but a lot of men felt completely overwhelmed,” says Lisa Waters, the centre’s deputy directorate manager. “Some were very distressed. Some were very confused. Some were very angry and wondered why we’d come and told them this, which you can understand.” Not one of the victims wanted to see the films, but some were glad to get back watches and phones they hadn’t seen since a drunken night out many moons ago Sinaga had stolen them, along with passports and bank cards, as souvenirs. A couple of men immediately went online and deleted him as a Facebook friend. They were horrified to realise the friendly man who had added them after they had woken up in his flat in a pile of vomit (“He said he saved me, that I was passed out on the sidewalk next to Factory,” said one man, giving evidence via videolink) had in fact drugged and abused them.In court, the contrast between Sinaga and his victims – tall, stocky, laddish, all but four heterosexual – was striking. Most were students, but there was also a chef, a personal trainer and two members of the armed forces. The youngest were 18, the oldest 36. One was still in sixth form.Though the trials delivered powerful justice for all 48 men, many questions remained unanswered. How had Sinaga kept his double life a secret from all his friends and lovers? When did he begin his campaign of rape? And had the police missed opportunities to catch him earlier?When reporting restrictions were finally lifted earlier this month, Sinaga’s friends told us they could not believe the man they knew as “Rey” was capable of such wickedness. Even his most recent boyfriend, whom we tracked down to a hotel in mainland Europe, struggles to reconcile the predator with the man he was in a relationship with for six months in 2013. George (not his real name) first met Sinaga through a mutual friend over drinks at Sinaga’s flat. “He was kind, always joyful,” George recalls. The pair spent hours at coffee shops, talking about everything from childhood to politics, “from the simplest to the most complicated” topics. George says Sinaga went for straight-looking guys – “I know he liked the ‘hetero’ type and the first time we met he thought I was hetero” – but adds that their sex life was normal: there was no role-play around pretending to be asleep, although Sinaga did like to wake him up by initiating intercourse. “I am confused, puzzled,” George says, during a break from work. “I would never imagine him raping somebody. It is so unlike the Rey I knew.”News of the case came as less of a surprise to his former flatmate, Andrew (not his real name). We first contacted him in May last year, during the second trial, but he wasn’t ready to talk. He changed his mind on 6 January this year, after Sinaga was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum tariff of 30 years. Whereas Sinaga’s friends all talk about the giggly party animal who was obsessed with Victoria Beckham and the Spice Girls, who recounted every sexual encounter like it was a fairytale or a Hollywood film, Andrew knew Sinaga had a predatory side.From September 2013 until early 2015, Andrew lived in the spare room of Sinaga’s flat in Montana House, a modern block on Princess Street in central Manchester. Andrew is now 27, but he was 21 when he moved in, and worked at G-A-Y, one of the biggest clubs on Canal Street, the heart of Manchester’s gay village. He paid £400 a month for the box room, sandwiched between the open-plan kitchen and living room, and Sinaga’s large master bedroom. The flat was in a great location, five minutes’ walk from G-A-Y and a 10-minute stroll from Manchester University’s main campus, where Sinaga completed his first master’s after arriving in the UK on a student visa in 2007. For Sinaga, the flat had another significant advantage, being on the same street as two nightclubs, Factory – in a building that once housed Joy Division’s record label – and Fifth Avenue. On a busy night, the Factory queue snaked right under the flat’s window. Across the street, he could see drunk students eating kebabs in the bus shelter. If he had his windows open, he could hear them remonstrating with the bouncers who wouldn’t let them back in.Andrew moved in after his sister, a longterm friend of Sinaga’s, moved out. But the two men ended up on such bad terms that Sinaga called 999 to ask police for help to evict him in February 2015. Sinaga was advised that it was a civil matter. The police had no evidence then that their time was being wasted by a serial rapist.Sinaga was hard to live with, Andrew remembers. He hogged the bathroom and spent hours in front of the mirror on his great obsession: his highlighted hair, which he maintained with industrial quantities of hairspray. Andrew was not allowed in Sinaga’s bedroom but would sometimes slip in when he was out, usually to borrow hairspray. “The rest of the flat was quite nice but it was disgusting in there,” he recalls. Sinaga had a double bed, but on the floor there always seemed to be a makeshift bed cobbled together from two grubby duvets.Sinaga’s narcissism soon began to grate. His PhD thesis said it all, Andrew says. Entitled “Sexuality And Everyday Transnationalism Among South Asian Gay And Bisexual Men In Manchester”, it was basically an autobiography: “He was doing a PhD on himself.” Leeds University failed the thesis in 2016. According to Andrew’s sister, Sinaga seemed convinced that the world would end without him. “I had an argument with him once, because he believed that if he died, all life would cease to exist,” she says. “I tried to explain that we would all still be here. He didn’t get it.”A few months after moving in, Andrew noticed something odd: Sinaga kept leaving the flat in the middle of the night and coming back a short time later with different men. “I just thought, OK, he’s out to meet a guy: a Grindr hook-up or something,” Andrew says. “Some of the places on Canal Street stay open until 9am, so it’s not that he didn’t have anywhere to go. It just started to seem unusual when it became so frequent.” He kept shtum: “I had a boyfriend who I would bring back to the flat as well, so I wasn’t going to say anything about him bringing people home. I consider myself to be a very unprying person. I didn’t really question it, and I suppose I didn’t really want to know either.”Then, walking home from G-A-Y one night, Andrew saw Sinaga hanging around outside Factory. Another time he was outside Fifth Avenue. As he recalls the encounters, he shakes his head, unable to comprehend how he failed to understand what he saw.“He was standing there on his own. That was unusual. That’s when I started to think he was taking advantage, even though I didn’t make the connection I should have. But I thought: fair enough, he goes for drunk guys – maybe he’s got low self-esteem. I could tell he had only just left the flat. He’s a very well-dressed person but he was standing there in sweat pants, flip-flops and a jumper, as if he had literally just left in his pyjamas.”Pepe (also not his real name) first met Sinaga around 2009, in the Bannatyne gym in Manchester’s gay village. He was in a WhatsApp group with Sinaga where he would discuss his conquests. Some of their messages, from July 2015, were read to the court, with Sinaga announcing that his latest flatmate was going to move out in August and he would be living alone. “You can get in lots of straight boys, darling,” Pepe replied. Sinaga responded with a picture of a 21-year-old he had raped eight times the previous evening, having met the younger man drunkenly trying to walk six miles home to Stockport after losing his bank card. “Hahahahaha,” Pepe wrote. “There’s always a new one.” Earlier, on New Year’s Day 2015, Sinaga had boasted of sleeping with another straight man he had met in Factory, saying he had begun the year with his “breakthrough to the gay world”. He sent some pictures he said he had taken “secretly” that morning. “I always wonder how you manage to get these straight boys,” Pepe mused. “Lol dunno,” replied Sinaga. “Good luck mostly lol. Plus it’s Manchester hun. There’s always a chance here.” But Pepe, who fell out with Sinaga shortly after this exchange, insists he had no idea any of the men had been raped. And he says he never believed his friend was “turning” straight men in a sinister way: “When we say ‘straight’ guys, many people aren’t comfortable with themselves as being gay, so they call themselves straight.” Pepe says he never slept with Sinaga but remembers a detective asking what role Sinaga took in bed. “I said he was the bottom, in gay slang… Many times he mentioned to us, ‘Oh my God, I went home with a guy last night and my bum is still burning.’”Despite being “out” in Manchester, Sinaga was in the closet with his parents, Pepe remembers. Every time he went back to Indonesia, he had his hair cut shorter before he got on the plane. “They knew he was different somehow but he never told his family about his sexuality, that’s for sure,” Pepe says. “He shared with us a couple of times before going home that he was nervous. His father would give him a hard time. Once, he mentioned that he wanted him to meet this girl in London, the daughter of some important person from his country. He would send us messages when he was in Indonesia saying his family were horrible and they wanted him to get married.”George, the ex-boyfriend, says Sinaga had a poor relationship with his father, a palm oil tycoon: “He told me a few times how he was glad that England gave him the opportunity of living in a country where he didn’t need to pretend to be someone else.” Yet Sinaga presented two very different faces in his adopted home. Andrew first got a sense of his dark side in 2014, when one day he heard a knock on the door. “I didn’t think Rey was in, so I answered it,” Andrew says. “There was this guy there, he must have been 18 to 21, and he looked surprised to see me. He said, ‘Oh, sorry, does a Chinese guy live here?’ I said, ‘Yeah – Rey?’ and he said, ‘Yeah – is he in?’ I said, ‘I don’t think so.’ The guy looked really uncomfortable and he said, ‘It’s just that I was here last night’ – or the other night. He said, ‘I woke up here’ and he used the word rape: ‘I just want to know if I was raped or not.’ And at that point I thought: fuck.”Andrew gave the man Sinaga’s number and shut the door. Almost immediately, he heard ringing from Sinaga’s room. “Rey came through to the living room a few minutes later, laughing, saying: ‘Did you give my number to a boy?’” Andrew remembers the visitor being tall, gym-toned, tanned, with short hair. He was nervous and stuttered slightly. “That’s when I started to worry what was going on.” But he didn’t ask any questions: “I suppose I didn’t want to know.” He also didn’t want to be homeless. “I had nowhere else to go.”  Not long afterwards, Sinaga brought home another man in his mid-20s, late at night. A fight broke out shortly after they went into Sinaga’s bedroom. “I came out of my room and saw this guy stripped down to his boxers with, like, one sock on or something. And he’s got Rey up against his bedroom door with his hand on his throat. They were shouting at each other,” Andrew recalls. “I then spent about an hour calming this guy down, getting him dressed slowly, and out of my flat, and walking him down to the front door, just trying to reassure him… I can’t remember what he was saying to me because he was very drunk and wasn’t really making a lot of sense. I think he thought Rey had tried to touch him, and he didn’t really know why he was there.”While many of the victims had no memory of meeting Sinaga, and no clue they had been abused – because, the jury was told, of the “relaxing” effect of GHB, the date rape drug he was suspected of using – others stayed in touch. One 19-year-old, who met Sinaga after a night out on Canal Street with his mum, texted with him the following day, unaware that Sinaga had raped him six times the previous evening. He’d woken up at 10am, naked and confused, and Sinaga said he’d undressed him because he’d been sick. He gave the young man clean clothes to wear – a pink T-shirt with the word “love” on it and some jogging bottoms – and the two started drinking again. Sinaga then asked him for sex and he refused, saying he had a girlfriend.That afternoon he sent Sinaga an SMS: “Yo man haha literally just got home I’m so pissed we will have to meet up tomorrow Night if your up for it.” Sinaga was enthusiastic about the idea: “Looking forward to another good old drunken night. Bring us the shots till we pass out. Ha!” But the boy got cold feet when Sinaga steered the conversation back towards sex.In 15 months living with Sinaga, Andrew says he saw no evidence of drug-taking in the flat. He knew from the gay scene what paraphernalia came with taking GHB, and never saw any of it: no pipettes, no syringes, none of the little fish-shaped soy sauce bottles you get with sushi sets that are just the right size for measuring out a dose. “He just drank alcohol, and not even that much,” Andrew says.Listening to the evidence, it was hard not to wonder why the victims did not realise what had happened to them. Perhaps it was the complacency that comes with being a young, straight man. “I thought briefly he might have done something, but I thought: stuff like that doesn’t happen,” one 21-year-old told the jury. Had dozens of young women woken up in Sinaga’s flat with no underwear on, and no memory of the night before, would they have been more likely to suspect the worst and go to the police?Only two of the men Sinaga attacked were sufficiently worried after waking up to seek medical assistance. One, a 33-year-old, called police and also contacted Saint Mary’s sexual assault referral centre in Manchester city centre, on 25 April 2017. “I just wanted to report a, like, possible sexual assault thing,” he told a 999 operator, explaining that he had woken up with a sore anus in what he thought was a hotel room, with an Asian man next to him being “overly friendly… just like cuddling me, stroking me”. He thought he might have been at the Ibis hotel, across the road from Montana House, the address on his Uber receipt.Forensic analysis identified a stranger’s semen in the man’s boxer shorts, but there was no match on the DNA database, and the police investigation focused on the hotel and went nowhere. Sinaga was unknown to police as a perpetrator, though he had reported crimes, Andrew says. Once, towards the end of their flat-share, Andrew was on his PlayStation in the living room when Sinaga brought home another stranger. “The door opened and I turned to see this giant, terrifying-looking man. He was clearly on drugs – his eyes were massively dilated – and he looked scary, thuggish, as tall as the door.”Sinaga took the man into his bedroom, smiling. Within a minute, a fight had started. Sinaga and Andrew managed to get the man out into the communal corridor, where he started smashing things up, barging into a neighbour’s unlocked flat. Sinaga called 999, and the police arrived and took the man away. They asked Sinaga if he wanted to press charges, but he declined. What on earth was he doing with a violent drug dealer who was known to carry knives, they asked. “You’re very lucky that neither of you has been killed,” the police officer said.In the early hours of 2 June 2017, Sinaga was almost killed by the last young man he brought back to Montana House. The boy, an 18-year-old rugby player, had lost his friends in Factory. Sinaga, then 34, suggested he come back to his flat and try to contact them from there. And that’s as much as the boy could remember until he woke up several hours later, lying face down, with his jeans and boxer shorts around his knees. He was in a bathroom and Sinaga, naked, was sexually assaulting him.In the ensuing fight, Sinaga bit the boy, who responded with such powerful punches that by the time the paramedics arrived, Sinaga had to be taken to hospital with a suspected bleed on the brain. Police initially arrested the wrong man, suspecting the 18-year-old of grievous bodily harm. That changed when they succeeded in unlocking Sinaga’s phones. Though police believe Sinaga has been abusing men since 2005, the earliest victim to go to court was the man he met on New Year’s Day 2015.The Sinaga story is unlikely to end there. At least 30 new potential victims have approached the police since he was sentenced, with detectives promising to fully investigate every new case they uncover. The CPS has left open the possibility of future trials, and Andrew now feels ready to go to court and testify for any of the men he met while he was Sinaga’s flatmate – particularly the one who knocked on the door the morning after, asking if he might have been raped. “I really hope he gets in touch with the police. I really want to help,” Andrew says.Only Sinaga knows how many men ended up comatose and abused in his city centre flat, or why he did it. From his prison cell at Strangeways, he has refused for two and a half years to cooperate with probation officers, detectives or psychologists. According to his mother, he still maintains his innocence. He will be 66 when he is first eligible for release – or even older, following the attorney general’s referral of his sentence to the court of appeal. Perhaps, when the enormity of that dawns on him, he may feel willing to tell all about his horrifying campaign. • Anyone with information about this case can contact GMP on 101.

His second ball to Elgar is too straight and fizzed through midwicket for four the fifth is steered to third man for another boundary.“The struggles of Buttler make me really sad,” says Phil Harrison. “Partly because I love watching him and am convinced there’s a Test player in there somewhere. But also because there’s a subset of English cricket supporters who, I suspect, have been looking forward to being proved right about this. But it’s easy to rewrite history - for about the first year he was back in the team, he was superb. One of the biggest single factors in England’s 2018 win over India and very good against SL later that year too. I think it’s probably time for Foakes - I feel like Buttler’s lost confidence in his defensive technique which partly explains that shot earlier. But my overriding feeling is disappointment about what might have been.”Yes, same here. He was extremely good against India in 2018 and decent against Sri Lanka and West Indies the following winter - but on reflection, I think that, even when he was doing so well, he had made an uneasy peace with himself about his Test-match tempo. He then played in the Ashes when mentally shattered, had a few soft dismissals and started to overthink his batting again.18th over: South Africa 29-1 (Elgar 13, van der Dussen 0) That was a sizzling delivery from Wood to dismiss Malan: 94mph, perfect line and length and with just enough movement to find the edge. Wood is given a fifth over, which is fair enough given how menacing he looked in this fourth. And what a good decision it was! He has picked up the wicket of Pieter Malan, who edged a beautiful delivery through to Buttler. It was very close to a no-ball, but Wood just landed behind the line. Ben Stokes update As expected, he has been fined 15 per cent of his match fee and given one demerit point for yesterday’s contretemps with a South African fan.17th over: South Africa 28-0 (Elgar 13, Malan 15) Although England would have liked a wicket or two with the new ball, the scoring rate is such that they will feel pretty relaxed. They have bowled pretty well, with excellent discipline, and Woakes (6-3-7-0) has been the pick of the attack. He beats Malan with a fine full-length delivery that straightens past the edge. England went up for caught behind without success. The noise that got them excited was bat on pad.16th over: South Africa 26-0 (Elgar 12, Malan 14) Malan gets his first boundary, slapping Wood up and over the slips for four. He was hit on the chest by the previous delivery. Wood’s rhythm is much better now, and later in the over Elgar inside-edges a very sharp delivery for four. It brushed the fingertips of Buttler, ing low to his right, but I doubt even Ben Foakes’ No1 fan would call that a chance.“Bob,” says Mac Millings. “Not a bad shout, that XI, but I have a couple of questions. I get why you’ve got Trescothick in there, but he did play (from memory) 76 Tests, scoring a little under 6,000 at a little under 44, so does he really count? As for Hick, he played (off the top of my head) in 65 Tests, scoring 3,383 runs at 31.32, earning him a place in a different side - the What Actually Was XI. Now Tufnell is a different matter. He played 42 times for England (121 wickets at 37.68), but how different that might have been if he’d had a single captain who trusted him. Also, stick SF Barnes in there, and put Graeme Pollock and Barry Richards in your World XI.”Millings, shut your mouth and send me a comedy XI. (Okay, I think Trescothick counts because he missed at least five years of Test cricket, and in a different culture could have been selected just for home Tests Hick because I wonder what would have happened had he started against, say, New Zealand rather than an affronted Curtly Ambrose.)15th over: South Africa 17-0 (Elgar 8, Malan 9) Oh my. The ball after being edged for the first boundary of the innings, Woakes beats Elgar with a brutish lifter. Then he does it again to complete a superb over.“Alas,” says Gary Naylor, “I fear Moeen for Tufnell in that XI.”Really? I think Moeen has overachieved in his Test career, certainly with the ball. I suppose we’ll never know what would have happened had he not been the designated utliity batsman, though I don’t think he would have averaged more than 32-35. 15th over: South Africa 13-0 (Elgar 4, Malan 9) Wood suddenly jumps wide of the crease to beat Malan with a lovely delivery that straightens sharply off the pitch. It’s another maiden, the seventh of the innings, already.Here’s Richard Firth’s WMHB XI: “Knight, Stewart (because if he had just been left to be an opener, he would have been amazing), Hick, Fairbrother, Crawley, Ramprakash, Buttler, Headley, S.Jones, Bicknell, Tufnell.”Stewart is a good shout – from memory he scored 2943 runs at 45.98 when he opened the batting and didn’t keep wicket.14th over: South Africa 13-0 (Elgar 4, Malan 9) “Not to be too maudlin,” says Felix Wood, “but Ben Hollioake probably deserves a spot in the What Might Have Been XI.”In a one-day team, almost certainly, although I never thought he’d make it in Test cricket. That sounds a bit callous, I realise, but there’s no room for sentiment when you’re picking a hypothetical sentimental XI!13th over: South Africa 13-0 (Elgar 4, Malan 9) Malan, falling over to the off side, inside-edges Wood behind square for a couple. Nothing else to report. Wood’s pace, since you asked, didn’t appear in that over. It felt like he was in the high 80s.“If Buttler is dropped for the Sri Lanka Tests, does it mark the swiftest unravelling of a coach’s legacy in history?” asks Gary Naylor. “It will be, in Tests anyway, as if Trevor Bayliss never happened. Some of us are not entirely displeased with that.”I know what you mean, but wasn’t Bayliss one of Foakes’ biggest fans in the England set up? I do agree that, for whatever reason, the GerrardLampard era of English cricket finally seems to be coming to an end. “I’ve enjoyed this series immensely, even if Buttler seems destined to join Hameed in my team of what might have been,” says Felix Wood. “Presumably South Africa’s best chance here is to put England’s fragile attack into their fifth spells and then cash in and post 600?”Oh go on then, here’s my What Might Have Been England XI (off the top of my head, since I started watching Test cricket in 1988): Hameed, Trescothick, Lathwell, Hick, Ramprakash, Maynard, Buttler (wk), Headley, S Jones, Finn, Tufnell.12th over: South Africa 11-0 (Elgar 4, Malan 7) That’s tea. It was a session of two distinct segments. England biffed 100 from 16.2 overs, including a last-wicket partnership of 82 in 8.2 between Mark Wood and Stuart Broad. Then South Africa’s openers calmed everything down by adopting the oldfangled method of leaving as many deliveries as possible. See you in 15 minutes for the evening session.11th over: South Africa 10-0 (Elgar 4, Malan 6) Mark Wood replaces Stuart Broad, who bowled an adequate spell of 5-2-5-0. His first over looks a little stiff, although the speedgun has him peaking at 91mph. Two singles from it.“That England scorecard - featuring the lowest highest score in a total of 400+ - might be my favourite since this beauty,” says Tom Bowtell. “England scored 304 in the second innings with no fifties and the highest score being Harmison’s 42 at number 11.”Was Harmison’s really the highest score? Morally? But yes, I love scorecards like that. The one burned on my brain is England’s second innings at Trinidad in 1986. Go on, extras lad!10th over: South Africa 8-0 (Elgar 3, Malan 5) Woakes beats Malan with a fine delivery. He has started well, with a fullish length and a soupçon of outswing. Jeez I love that word. South Africa are going nowhere at the moment, though I doubt that will bother two openers as temperamentally sound as Elgar and Malan.9th over: South Africa 8-0 (Elgar 3, Malan 5) Broad continues, in fact, and tempts Elgar into a loose stroke well wide of off stump. The ball whistles past the edge through to Buttler.“I’m an unabashed Foakes Fan,” says Stephen Brown. “In terms of your point about Ed Smith having the reflected glory of Buttler’s 2018 Jos didn’t have the gloves in most (any?) of those games. Surely selectors might be tempted to regain that glory by taking the gloves off him and giving them to Foakes?”Yes you’re right, he played as a batsman, but I still don’t think it will be an easy decision to leave him out – especially as the next time Buttler is dropped will probably be the last. Nobody wants to die wondering about his Test career. But my feeling is that, barring a good spell in 2018, he has never quite got his head round how to bat in first-class cricket.8th over: South Africa 6-0 (Elgar 2, Malan 4) Chris Woakes comes on for Sam Curran, who bowled a good spell of 3-1-3-0 and might switch ends to replace Broad. His first over, to Malan, is a decent range-finder. A maiden.7th over: South Africa 6-0 (Elgar 2, Malan 4) Malan, tempted into the drive by a fuller delivery from Broad, drags the ball back onto his pads. It’s been a quiet start to the innings - a bit of movement, especially for Curran, but it’s not exactly going off alarming.6th over: South Africa 5-0 (Elgar 2, Malan 3) The South African openers, Elgar in particular, are playing as little as possible. Curran gives him plenty of opportunity to shoulder arms in that over. 5th over: South Africa 4-0 (Elgar 2, Malan 2) A good over from Broad, who found a better line from round the wicket. His last delivery jagged back to cut Elgar in half that could easily have found the inside edge and gone back onto the stumps.“Many thanks to Ian Forth for the Georgics (over 65),” says Stuart Middleton. “The piling of Pelion upon Ossa also appears in The Odyssey (XI.315-16) where the giants Otos and Ephialtes threaten war against the gods ‘and were minded to pile Ossa on Olympos, and above Ossa Pelion of the trembling leaves, to climb the sky.’ (trans. Richmond Lattimore).”4th over: South Africa 2-0 (Elgar 1, Malan 1) Malan shoulders arms to a ball that jags back to hit him on the thigh pad. It was a very safe leave on length. The movement is encouraging, though, and later in the over Malan digs out a lovely inswinging yorker. With the new ball swinging Curran looks a threat, and if Broad has one more poor over I would replace him with Woakes.3rd over: South Africa 2-0 (Elgar 1, Malan 1) Another maiden from Broad, with Elgar able to leave almost everything. He hasn’t started brilliantly.“Regarding Ben Foakes and The Ongoing Argument, I guess that if your keeper is only going to score 20 runs, whoever you pick, you might as well pick the best keeper,” says David Horn. “I think whoever gets the gloves in Sri Lanka will be quite revealing of Ed Smith’s flexibility of thought, as much as anything else.”I think it should be Foakes, but I suspect Buttler will be given one more series. Ed Smith enjoyed the reflected glory of Buttler’s success in 2018, so it won’t be easy to leave him out. 2nd over: South Africa 2-0 (Elgar 1, Malan 1) Curran’s first ball, wide of Malan’s off stump, curves encouragingly through to the keeper. His fifth is even better, zipping slightly the other way to beat Malan’s crooked defensive grope. That’s an excellent start.“Helllo,” writes Vigasini Senthil. “I absolutely love following  for live cricket matches. I started watching cricket from last May (starting with the World Cup) and was hooked. Being a typical Indian cricket fan, I don’t know how I switched lanes to England. During the finals, I spent half of the matches at my prayer room. I still vividly remember myself saying to God about how I would stop watching cricket if England didn’t win the World Cup. (I still can’t believe I did this). When they did win, I was way more than happy and a tiny bit emotional too. Now I never miss any T20s, ODIs or Tests. Getting to watch England play (let alone win) makes me so, so happy. Seems like I came at the right time. I’m 15 years old btw.”If this isn’t the sweetest email we’ll receive all year, I don’t know what is.1st over: South Africa 0-0 (Elgar 0, Malan 0) Stuart Broad will open the bowling, on the ground where he demolished South Africa to win the 2015-16 series. He starts with a quiet over to Elgar, a maiden. It looks like Sam Curran will share the new ball.It’ll be interesting to see who takes the new ball for England. I’d go with Woakes and Broad, since you didn’t ask, although it’s also tempting to give it to Mark Wood while he’s still high on his own batting.Let’s look at those two innings in all their statistical glory:Nothing will ever make up for the pain of Dave Richardson and Paul Adams’ 10th-wicket partnership at Cape Town in 1996, but that still felt pretty good. It has probably finished South Africa off in the series.There have been 15,330 partnerships of fifty or more in Test cricket. At 9.82 runs per over, that was the 11th fastest. Broad holes out to deep square leg to end a riotous tenth-wicket partnership of 82 in just 8.2 overs.98th over: England 396-9 (Wood 35, Broad 39) Thanks Tanya, hello everyone. The fun continues after the drinks break, with Hendricks disappearing for another 19! Broad pulled his fourth six over midwicket, Wood lashed his second over extra cover. South Africa’s bowling in the last half hour has been execrable at best.97th over: England 377-9 (Broad 31, Wood 28) Paterson, stocky, with a Maradona-Aguero-esque low centre of gravity, trundles in and England’s flair boys only manage a couple. That’s drinks, and time for me to hand over to Rob Smyth. Thanks for all the messages this morning, ta-rah!96th over: England 374-9 (Broad 29, Wood 27) Hendricks finds some control, but they still knock three singles and a wide from the over. You can feel the frustration oozing out of every South African bowler. Broad can’t bat. But yet here he is.Some wise thoughts from Nat Godden: “It may be hard to precisely measure the Boycott boredom factor (though he was widely regarded as peerless in that area), but those of us with long memories might wonder how these two compare in respect of batting partners run out (for which Sir G was also rather well-known). The figures must be there somewhere.

Where’s the danger now? And will we ever get over the shock?Everything you know is a lie. Yesterday, the world was shaken to its very foundations when a video of Justin Bieber taking part in James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke revealed that the whole thing is a sham, and James Corden doesn’t actually drive the car – rather, it’s towed by a truck.Frankly, from this point onwards, up is down and down is up. Who knows what to believe any more? If Corden doesn’t really drive the car on Carpool Karaoke, then what else has he been lying to us about? Did he really write Gavin \u0026amp Stacey, or did he use a ghostwriter? Are the 1,000-year-old eggs he uses in Fill Your Guts or Spill Your Guts really 1,000 years old? Next he’ll be telling us that he isn’t even really a hideous dancing CGI cat. How dare he? The man, quite honestly, deserves to spend the rest of his days sitting on a throne of fibs at the summit of Porky Pie Mountain.And before you accuse me of overreacting, let me point out that I am by no means alone in my shock. Once the pictures hit the internet, all hell broke loose. “I feel lied to,” raged one presumably former Corden fan on Twitter. “Haven’t felt this betrayed since finding out Santa Claus isn’t real,” screamed another, angry enough to punch the head clean off the next cardboard Peter Rabbit cinema standee she saw. The world is on my side here. We’re hurt and angry.Oh, sure, there have been other fakery scandals in the past. In 2007, BBC One’s controller was forced to resign after a documentary edited footage of the Queen to make her look slightly more grumpy than she actually was. The BBC’s Frozen Planet wildlife series was partly filmed in a zoo. The X Factor used to film its contestants flying business class to Los Angeles, before shunting them off to economy once the cameras stopped rolling. But that’s fine. You expect lies from BBC One and David Attenborough. But James Corden? Impeccable torch of moral virtue James Corden? No. Never.There will be those who will try to defend this scandal, claiming that it is simply standard practice for the TV industry and that it probably wouldn’t have been that safe for him to be so distracted while driving, but it’s too little, too late. The joy of Carpool Karaoke was never the singing. The singing part is terrible. Nobody wants to watch a professional singer drowned out by Corden howling and shrieking like a burning witch. That’s awful. It’s offensive on every level.But now, what’s the point? All this time – with Adele, with Mariah Carey, with Paul McCartney, when he let Stevie Wonder have a go at driving – Corden has been snuggled up all tight behind a tow truck. It’s heartbreaking. Never at any point was Corden ever in danger of accidentally mowing through a crowd of tourists and wrapping his car around a lamppost. Still, at least we’ve finally worked out how he got car insurance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2eec3aa7ca885b286100a9e67a5a285643a72f1e/0_0_4722_2833/master/4722.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ffd56c25abe0e60afea49aa9cc74741","title":"some folks were tearful cia waterboarding on trial in guantanamo","story":"‘The Preacher’, one of three authorised to carry out torture method, has still not been identified after 17 years There were three men authorised by the CIA to carry out waterboarding on detainees in America’s “war on terror”. Two of them were contractors who are in Guantánamo Bay this week to give evidence. The third has still not been identified 17 years after the torture was committed.In the courtroom of the military commission, the CIA officer was referred to only by three-digit code NZ7, or simply as “the Preacher” – a nickname he was given because of his peculiar way of terrorising detainees.According to James Mitchell, a psychologist on contract to the CIA who helped draft and apply their “enhanced interrogation techniques”, the Preacher “would at random times put one hand on the forehead of a detainee, raise the other high in the air, and in a deep Southern drawl say things like, ‘Can you feel it, son? Can you feel the spirit moving down my arm, into your body?’”Mitchell gave that chilling description in his memoir, Enhanced Interrogation, and on the witness stand on Thursday, he confirmed the Preacher’s role at the CIA black sites. He was giving evidence at a pre-trial hearing in the case against five defendants charged for the 911 al-Qaida attacks, including the self-styled mastermind, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.Mitchell, together with his friend and business partner, Bruce Jessen – who is due to testify next week – have been the public face of the US torture programme for five years, settling out of court in 2017 in a civil suit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of three prisoners.Almost everyone else involved in the extensive programme, involving a network of black sites around the world, has remained in the shadows. In terms of legality, it is still the dark side of the moon.Defence lawyers at the Guantánamo military commission hearings have asked to examine 52 witnesses. They have so far been permitted to question only two, Mitchell and Jessen.James Connell, representing defendant Ammar al-Baluchi, lost his patience on Thursday when prosecutors objected that he was asking Mitchell about events he had not directly witnessed.“He’s the only witness we’ve got. The government has blocked all the CIA witnesses,” Connell complained.Four days before the current pre-trial hearing, the 40th in eight years of legal skirmishes, the prosecution changed the classification rules, and amended them again on Monday on the evening before the first open session. As a result, some facts that were previously unclassified, in published books for example, were reclassified, sending defence attorneys scrambling to reframe their planned line of questioning.The longer the hearings have continued, the clearer it has become that the Mitchell and Jessen partnership was just a small part of the infrastructure of torture, with its own bureaucracy and personal rivalries. In his testimony, Mitchell railed repeatedly against the “middle management” who he believed was plotting against him.Mitchell became embroiled in a vicious turf war with a rival, the CIA chief of interrogations, for mastery of the “enhanced programme”. Each sought to use their links to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, to get the other removed from their post. In that struggle the detainees were used as bargaining counters. The two men had them tortured for training or demonstration purposes.In the courtroom this week, the interrogations chief has been referred to by the code NX2. Mitchell calls him the “new sheriff”, but it has been reported his real name was Charlie Wise, who had honed his craft carrying out interrogations for the Contra rebels in Nicaragua in the 1980s. He apparently died of a heart attack in 2003, just weeks after being dismissed.According to declassified cables and courtroom testimony, Wise set up his own training programme, and took his students to a black site in Afghanistan, codenamed Cobalt, to practise their techniques on Ammar al-Baluchi and other prisoners. During that training, Baluchi was repeatedly slammed against a wall, suffering brain trauma as a result.“Looks like they used your client as a training prop,” Mitchell told Connell. A newly declassified paragraph in a secret CIA inspector general report quotes one of the students as saying the site was used for “on-the-job training”. Trainees had to use each of their techniques on Baluchi and other inmates in order to earn certification.An unsanctioned, improvised waterboard was also set up at the Cobalt site, according to defence lawyers. It does not seem to have been part of the training, but it was used on at least one detainee.The CIA was forced to close down its first main interrogation centre in Thailand in late 2002 when its existence was discovered by the New York Times. The “high value detainees” were transferred by rendition flights to a new site in Poland, codenamed Blue, which was run by Wise.Mitchell visited Blue shortly before Christmas in 2002, and testified he witnessed at least two extreme techniques that had not been approved by the CIA or the justice department. In one, a piece of wooden dowel was put behind the knees of a detainee who was made to kneel and then had his back forced back “until his shoulder blades were touching the floor”.In another, the prisoner’s elbows were strapped together with a strap behind his back and his hands were raised above his head. Fearing the torture would cause permanent injury, Mitchell said he tried to stop it but was told “it was none of my fucking business”.When the contractor declared he wanted to return to the US, Wise told him he was not allowed to leave, Mitchell claimed. Nor could Mitchell contact the outside world as all communications equipment at the site were locked up. For a week he was a prisoner of his rival, he said.Mitchell said he was finally permitted to go home because the tension inside the site began damaging morale. On his return he said he complained to the CIA leadership but to no avail. Wise stayed in his job and Mitchell found he was giving courses at headquarters including the banned techniques more than four months later. The chief of interrogation was only fired that summer.Throughout his testimony this week, Mitchell has portrayed himself as a moderate who stuck to the rules and only used extreme measures when he felt he had no choice.He tried to halt waterboarding of the first major detainee, Abu Zubaydah, in August 2002, arguing that the prisoner was fully cooperating, but his superiors in Langley ordered told him and his team in the original black site in Thailand to “stay the course”.In an effort to win the argument, he said he persuaded the head CIA officer in the country to witness a waterboarding for himself.“I wanted the chief of station to experience what we were experiencing,” Mitchell said. “It didn’t smell pleasant. It smelled like sweat – kinda musky.”He also conceded he and Jessen were beginning to feel a bit exposed. They realised they were the only ones in the interrogation room not wearing a mask, and the torture was being videoed.The station chief turned up to watching Abu Zubaydah being waterboarded, but dressed as a guard, his face coveredWhen his superiors insisted he persevere in Thailand, he told them to send a delegation to witness the simulated drowning.“Buddy – you want it,” Mitchell told them. “Bring your rubber boots and come on down.”When the senior officials flew in, on 17 August, he waterboarded Abu Zubaydah even though he was quite sure the detainee had no actionable intelligence to surrender. It was done purely as a demonstration for the agency VIPs. And he applied the technique to the maximum extent allowed, pouring water on to a cloth on the prisoner’s face for 20 seconds and then a full 40 seconds. According to a CIA cable describing the event, Abu Zubaydah went into spasm.The visitors were stunned. “Some of the folks were tearful,” Mitchell said.“I was tearful, but I cry at dog food commercials,” Mitchell claimed. The psychologist’s eyes did indeed well up on a few occasions during his testimony this week, but the tears came when he was describing what he saw as his personal sacrifices. In contrast, he described waterboarding dispassionately, characterising it as “temporary discomfort”.“Does he care more about dog food commercials than he cares about human beings?” asked Terry Rockefeller, who was watching Mitchell’s testimony this week from the military commission’s public gallery on the other side of a reinforced glass partition.Her sister, Laura, was killed in the attacks on the World Trade Centre. She was an actress who just happened to be working in the twin towers in New York on September 11, 2001, on a day job hosting a business seminar on risk assessment.Terry is a member of a relatives’ group called September Eleventh Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, which is seeking justice for the attacks but opposes the use of the death penalty.“The fact that he can talk about something like waterboarding in such clinical terms ... That’s just crushing to me, because my country did it and because I feel a great loss,” Rockefeller said, pointing out that the use of torture against the defendants has vastly complicated the process of putting them on trial."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1b849c6078e891c7f0036660263ec11dc626d1c/0_352_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=946398da2fa7ea390e99d6d6efa4f593","title":"overtourism in europe historic cities sparks backlash","story":"Angry protests from residents in popular areas force city hall officials to take actionAcross Europe, historic cities are buckling. Mass tourism, encouraged by cash-hungry councils after the 2008 crash and fuelled by the explosion of cheap flights and online room rentals, has become a monster. The backlash, however, has begun.Meanwhile Airbnb, the biggest but far from only holiday lettings platform, has reported triple-digit growth in several European cities over the past five years, driving 10 of them to ask the EU for help. The cities have between 10,000 and 60,000 listings each.The net result is that over the course of a year, popular short-break destinations such as Barcelona and Amsterdam are hosting 20 or more visitors for each inhabitant, prompting angry protests from locals and forcing city halls to take action.It is not always evident, however, what that action should be – or if it will work. The trade-off between the revenues and jobs generated through tourism and quality of life is a tricky one. So the idea is not discouragement but management, say city halls.Overtourism in the historic centre of Amsterdam had gone beyond the already extreme nuisance of drunken visitors vomiting nightly on 17th-century doorsteps and urinating copiously in canals, according to city hall.With more than 19 million tourists in 2018 thronging a warren of narrow streets and alleyways that are home to 850,000 people, it was getting dangerous. “At times there was a real safety concern,” said Vera Al, of the finance and economic affairs department.The most crowded parts of the city – the red light district and the main nightlife areas of Rembrandtplein and Leidseplein – were becoming unliveable in the old centre shops selling wooden tulips, vacuum-packed cheese or cannabis seeds were replacing chemists, greengrocers and hairdressers. Doctors could no longer find surgery space.More than 60,000 jobs in Amsterdam are directly linked to tourism and visitors to the city spend more than €6bn (£5bn) annually.But over the past two years, the council has adopted tough measures. Tour coaches have mostly been banished to the outskirts and new shops catering solely to tourists have been outlawed by rewritten zoning regulations.There will be no new hotels once developers have exhausted existing licenses. Pending a possible outright ban in some neighbourhoods, Airbnb-style lets must sleep no more than four and cannot be let for more than 30 days a year.Some of the worst excesses, such as beer bikes – a pedal-powered mobile bar groups of drinkers – have been outlawed in the city centre. Tours of the red light district’s windows, running once every couple of minutes, are to be banned from 1 April, when all guided tours of the old centre will also require permits.The new mayor, Femke Halsema, has even tabled four possible options for the historic sex workers’ district, known as De Wallen. These include relocating all or part of it to other parts of the city, which would be a big call, politically, for part of the fabric of old Amsterdam.Somewhat less controversially, city hall has run several successful tourist awareness campaigns, including plastering large posters portraying residentson city centre doors, each bearing the slogan “We live here.”The concerted drive involves the mayor and all eight deputies. “It crosses all departments,” Al said. “None of it is rocket science, and we hope that taken together these measures will add up.”Nationally, said Elsje van Vuuren of the Dutch tourist board NBTC, the strategy is about dispersing visitors to lesser-known but equally attractive towns. The board has stopped promoting the Netherlands as a destination and aims instead to better manage the flow.Amsterdam has no illusions, however, that its programme will reduce the number of tourists visiting the city – or even significantly slow a rate of growth due to bring 40 million visitors a year to the Netherlands by 2030.“The focus is really about restoring liveability for all those who have been affected,” said Al. “It’s about making residents feel at home again. They shouldn’t feel like strangers in their own city. We believe a city is first for living in. Only second for visiting.”About 30 million people will visit Barcelona this year, a seemingly unstoppable tide, which has prompted exasperated residents to resort to ill-concealed irony.“Don’t tell anyone you have been on holiday to Barcelona,” reads one leaflet recently handed out to tourists. “They will steal the city from us, and it will stop being attractive to you and liveable for us.”The city’s response is improved management. Its Plan 2020 initiative aims to change “from managing tourism in the city, to managing the tourist city” – although Xavier Marcé, the councillor responsible, insists residents take priority.“I’m not interested in managing a tourist city,” he said. Dispersal is the answer, Marcé believes: the problem is not so much that Barcelona has sold itself but that it’s sold itself badly. Aware the sector brings in about €10bn a year, he said: “We don’t want more tourists but that doesn’t mean we want fewer.”As the city’s well-known sites, such as the Sagrada Familia, la Rambla and Park Güell are over-subscribed, the idea is to ert people to other areas and activities. The city is in talks with booking and others to devise an alternative visitor’s package.Barcelona has also declared a moratorium on new hotels in its most touristed areas, pushing visitors to the periphery (although as Pere Mariné of the 120-member Federation of Barcelona Residents’ Associations noted, where people sleep “doesn’t make much difference. They all want to go to the Sagrada Familia.”)Despite trying hard, the city seems unable to control the rise of Airbnb and others. According to a Vic University study, Barcelona has the highest density of tourist apartments in Europe: 12 for every 1,000 residents, compared with 10 in Rome and seven in London.The battle to reduce the number of available beds will not affect the millions of daytrippers. As many as 20,000 a day disembark from cruise ships to head for the sites but spend little ashore. More arrive by coach, clogging up and polluting the city.Marcé plans to force coaches to park on Barcelona’s perimeter and their passengers to use the already saturated public transport network extra buses will be financed by a new Barcelona tourist tax, he says.While residents are fed up with mass tourism, Mariné says there is no real popular movement for change, partly because tourists mean jobs. A demo with the slogan “Barcelona is not for sale” drew 2,000 people: “That’s not going to change anything.”Ultimately, the city’s powers are limited and the Catalan regional government tends to share the hospitality industry’s view that more is better. As tour operators survey the growing Asian market, millions more are due to discover Barcelona’s not-so-secret treasures. Stephen BurgenSick of the sight of tourists picnicking on the steps of Renaissance monuments, the mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella, announced in 2017 that he would douse the surfaces with water to keep people at bay.The hosepipe ploy never became permanent, only being used a couple of times on the steps of key monuments, such as the Basilica of Santa Croce, the burial place of Michelangelo, and the Chiesa di Santo Spirito. But the message resonated.“There does seem to have been a rise in awareness and sensitivity among visitors,” said Cecilia Del Re, Florence’s councillor for tourism and the environment. “We did a lot of campaigning, telling people not to throw their rubbish on the street and to respect the city, and this is showing some results.”Hefty fines for people caught scrawling their name on the Ponte Vecchio or peeing in the street in the historic centre, a Unesco world heritage site, have also improved decorum.Attracting 14 million tourists a year, Florence is Italy’s most-visited city after Venice and Rome. Boasting a huge and rich variety of the world’s heritage and surrounded by Tuscany’s rolling hills, the city’s popularity is easy to understand.But as with Venice and Rome, the growth in tourism has seen residents driven out of town by the rising cost of living and arrival of Airbnb: according to a Siena university study, one in five properties in the historic centre is advertised as a short-term let.Some measures, however, seem to be paying off. “One of the main issues is that everyone is so focused on the historic centre, which is only a 5km sq area in a city of 105km sq,” said Del Re. “So we are heavily promoting areas outside of the centre.“We are also close to launching an app that will direct people to other sites if, for example, the Uffizi Gallery is too crowded.” The city is also working with lesser known, but equally beautiful, towns in Tuscany, such as Arezzo, to promote them.City leaders are against imposing daily limits on the numbers who can enter the centre, but have increased tenfold the cost of taking tour buses that bring people to the city for a couple of hours. They are also promoting “congress tourism”, where people visit the city for a conference or business meeting and stay for a few days.Meanwhile, Florence authorities have converted some public property into social housing to motivate young people to move in. “We want to re-incentivise people to live in the historic centre,” said Del Re. Angela GuiffridaThe crowds surging into Prague’s majestic Old Town Square to witness last year’s seasonal illumination of Christmas lights were so vast that ambulance crews and squads of police officers were needed in case things got out of hand.The packed scene and cosmopolitan nature of the gathered multitudes seemed to attest to a marketing triumph that had assisted the Czech capital’s arrival as a first-rank global tourist draw.Yet the vast number of foreign visitors crammed into the modestly sized square crystallised what has become one of Prague authorities’ biggest headaches, prompting a major rethink of its tourism strategy that may eventually include a crackdown on short-term lettings.The sheer numbers drawn by the beautiful but relatively small medieval old town – encompassing Prague castle, the 600-year-old Charles bridge and a maze of ancient cobbled streets – has put a strain on resources and quality of life that many long-established residents find intolerable.A rising exodus of native residents and the growth of often tacky tourist shops at the expense of those catering for locals finally forced the authorities to act.The first step is a major publicity campaign to encourage visitors to explore greater Prague, a city of 1.4 million residents, beyond the limited quarter on either bank of the River Vltava, where the majority of its most storied buildings, as well as touristy restaurants and pubs, are located.“Too many people are coming just for a very small number of purposes, of buildings,” said Pavel Čižinský, the former mayor of the Prague 1 municipality, which includes the historic old town district. “To disperse the tourists more, I think it is necessary to involve more those who are running the tourist industry.“The guides must say to their groups, do you want to go through these crowds where everything is twice as expensive, or do you want to go and see something which is maybe half a kilometre from Charles bridge, but which is also nice.”The local tourist authority has published brochures called Prague Walks promoting the attractions of other neighbourhoods of historic interest, including Vinohrady, Karlín, Holešovice and Žižkov. For the strategy to work, however, strategists need to succeed in a far trickier goal: persuading visitors to come back for another look.Compounding the rising volume of visitors has been the growth of alcohol-fuelled tourism spurred by the Czech Republic’s deserved reputation as home to some of the world’s best, and cheapest, beer.Lucrative organised pub crawls and stag nights have become the bane of many locals’ lives, with high noise levels and rowdy behaviour commonplace in a city centre residential area that is home to about 25,000 Praguers.

Brendan uprooted yet another casualty of the kind that now threatens that magical avenue. Four years ago Storm Gertrude toppled two of the 200-year-old trees. Their timber was swiftly transfigured into 10 heavy doors, quite masterfully engraved with dragons, direwolves and the odd kraken sigil. Installed in tourist pubs and restaurants and featured on the glossy Thrones website, this was an impressive initiative. A similar spirit, perhaps, helped carry Northern Ireland through the three-year vacancy game of Stormont’s own thrones. At the North’s Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, for example, civil servants decided it was time the province had an environment strategy. “Under normal circumstances,” its website confided, “officials would have taken our policy direction from the minister . . .” Without a political boss, it invited “big ideas” from the public for use when the next one came along.The minister appointed this month from the ranks of the DUP has strong views of his own. Edwin Poots is a Free Presbyterian, creationist and denier of evolution. He concurs with the 17th century Archbishop Ussher of Armagh that the date of creation could be set at 4004 BC.None of this, it must be said, should predispose Poots against the conservation of bioersity, composed of all God’s creatures and an indispensable thread of any environment strategy. In 2010, as then minister for the environment, he introduced a permanent ban on hare coursing, readily endorsed by the Assembly. How Poots feels about badgers is not on record, but his new responsibility for agriculture lands him with the problem of high levels of bovine TB that join Brexit at the head of farmers’ concerns. His department chiefs again took new initiatives on their own. A scientific partnership, announced in 2018, seems bound to lead to some urgent decisions on preemptive badger culling. The spur for developing an environment strategy was publication of the UK’s State of Nature report for 2019. An earlier report, in 2016, showed that Northern Ireland was the most nature-depleted part of the UK, itself one of the most nature-depleted places in the world. After a long decline, the new report shows no let-up in loss of wildlife in the North. Some of its figures are all-Ireland threat estimates. But warnings, for example, on the future of breeding curlews and other waders, speak from a long record of local research. “Most original habitats have gone,” mourns the Ulster Wildlife Trust, “and natural ecosystems are fragmented. One in five of our species face extinction.”Lough NeaghIntensive farming takes up three-quarters of Northern Ireland. Framed often by neat, close-cropped hedges, its cattle, poultry and pig farms generate quite a disproportionate share of UK levels of ammonia, the report shows.The impact was illustrated dramatically at Moninea Bog in the southwest, a raised bog and Special Area of Conservation. Ammonia from a neighbouring farm severely damaged the bog vegetation, bleaching its mosses and killing algae on trees. Measures to reduce ammonia emissions are expected to benefit bioersity “within five to 10 years”.Farming run-off has historically polluted Lough Neagh, the biggest lake in these islands and a special arena for the North’s wildlife. It holds a notable population of pollan, a herring-like freshwater fish left over from the last ice age, and its eels continue to support a precarious traditional industry.The lake in winter also attracts thousands of migrant European waterbirds. But in 2013, researchers at Quercus, the Centre for Bioersity and Conservation Science at Queen’s University, reported a dramatic decline in the wintering duck population. It had fallen from 100,000 to less than 21,000, or 75 per cent over a decade.DredgingSome of the decline could be attributed to climate change, as the lakes feeding waterbirds in northeastern Europe stay ice-free in winter. But the Quercus team drew another conclusion: that the North’s farming environment schemes have reduced the organic run-off that boosted populations of water snails and other invertebrates, the food of wintering ducks.This finds no place in the 2019 State of Nature report, which does note six additional ducks for the region’s threatened red list. Nor does it delve into the long campaign by environmentalists to stop the commercial licensed dredging from Lough Neagh of some 1.5 millions of tonnes of sand a year.And Northern Ireland still has no national park, 18 years after the Mourne Mountains were selected. Resistance from resident farmers has delayed every effort at decision.

And Ms O’Neill described him as “a significant political figure” whose “mark on our history is indelible”.‘Extraordinary contribution’Taoiseach Leo Varadkar tweeted: “History will remember Seamus as an architect of the Good Friday Agreement, a committed peace builder and a tireless champion of an inclusive Ireland.”Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald said she was “saddened” to learn of his death and he would be remembered for his contribution to Irish politics over many decades as the SDLP deputy leader and the key role he played in achieving the Good Friday Agreement.”Labour Party leader Brendan Howlin expressed “ deep sadness” at the death of Mallon. “Seamus made an immeasurable contribution to the cause of peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland,” he said.British government Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith said Mr Mallon “dedicated his political career to making Northern Ireland a better place”.Mr Mallon served as deputy to first minister David Trimble in the first Northern Ireland Executive in 1999.Lord Trimble said his role in brokering the Belfast Agreement was a “huge” achievement.“Even though from then to now there have been huge ups and downs in the political system, there has been no move away from peace.”Former taoiseach Bertie Ahern said Mr Mallon was a key negotiator for the SDLP in the talks leading to the agreement. “Seamus was strong with courage and he had commitment to peace and making progress for Northern Ireland and this whole island.”A statement from former US president Bill Clinton said: “Hillary and I are saddened by the passing of Seamus Mallon, a hero of the peace process in Northern Ireland and a profoundly good man.“A teacher in practice and in heart, the lessons of his life and power of his example are as important today as ever.”Former British prime minister Tony Blair said Mr Mallon was “one of the most important architects of peace in Northern Ireland. Brave, blunt, often prepared to swim against the tide if he felt it right, he was someone deeply respected and admired across the troubled landscape of Irish politics.”‘Likable stubborness’Archbishop Eamon Martin, the Archbiship of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland, said the people of Armagh had “lost one of our most respected sons and bravest leaders”.He called for a renewed effort by political leaders to build a shared home place on the island of Ireland as a “fitting tribute to his legacy”.Tom Kelly, a close political ally and former vice-chair of the SDLP who worked as Mr Mallon’s Westminster assistant in the late 1980s and then on most of his elections, said the former deputy first minister had a “transformative” effect on Northern Ireland, complimenting SDLP leader John Hume.“John Hume painted with broad strokes, Seamus Mallon did detail,” Mr Kelly told The .He said Mr Mallon’s relationship with David Trimble was “an odd one, but it worked”. Mr Mallon could be “Thran” – a Northern word meaning stubborn, but it was “ a likable stubborness”.“But his strength was that his instincts chimed with those of the nationalist community, specifically in rural areas when he said something, it was how people felt, they just couldn’t articulate it.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4150608.1579896541!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 auction politics an added complication for electorate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThere is more in common with the way Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael allocate funds than there are differences.  Perhaps the crisis has changed Irish election campaigns – at least a bit. The line- up of promise after promise continues, based on a benign economic scenario which may, or may not, emerge.The basis for the two manifestos is the €11 billion in “unallocated resources” that the Department of Finance said would be available in the potential five-year term of the next government. There is more in common with the way the two parties allocate the cash than there are differences – but first the health warnings.If economic growth collapses – for example due to the United Kingdom not striking a trade deal with the European Union after Brexit – then much of this money would not be available. Also, we know from experience that the cost of dealing with inflation and demographic pressures in areas like health in particular is enormous – it costs a lot just to stand still. The parties both allocate cash for this, though the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has warned that existing Department of Finance figures do not allow nearly enough for these pressures.On the flip side – and presumably recognising that prudence is politically popular due to memories of the crash – both parties commit to pay cash into the rainy fund, with Fine Gael promising €500 million a year and Fianna Fáil €750 million. Fine Gael’s figures seem to leave a little more of the €11 billion unspent, so in terms of prudence, at least on paper, there is not a lot between them.Given that real life will almost certainly end up messier than the projections, it comes down to who you trust to make the right decisions and set the right priorities.Fine Gael’s Paschal Donohoe plays up the fact that he introduced a tight budget for this year, despite cash being available before an election, while Fianna Fáil focuses on the outgoing Government’s overspending in areas like health and on projects like the children’s hospital. Whether that party’s role in the build up to the economic crisis is a factor with voters is hard to tell and will probably only be evident after the election.The other thing that has changed in election campaigns is that promises of big tax cuts are off the table and the vast bulk of extra resources are planned to go to higher spending. Both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil say they will allocate spare resources on budget day roughly four to one in favour of spending over tax, with Fine Gael producing year-by-year breakdowns of how it would add up.The Fine Gael income-tax package is a bit bigger, centred on a commitment to increase the entry point to the higher rate from €35,300 now to €50,000 and an increase in the Universal Social Charge (USC) exemption threshold from €13,500 to €20,000. Fianna Fáil promises to increase the threshold for entering the higher rate by €3,000 for a single person and cut the USC rate which applies on earnings between about €20,000 and €70,000 from 4.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent.‘Extra funding’We have seen during the term of the outgoing Government how pressure on spending each year has meant very little by way of tax reductions. Also, it would require significant moves of credits and the tax bands each year just to ensure people don’t pay a higher proportion in tax as their wages increases. So the tax burden is not going to fall, whoever leads the next administration.The economics of election 2020 is all about spending. The debate about who can deliver and how much it will cost will rage in the days ahead. On health, Fine Gael’s headline commitment is to allocate €5 billion extra. This comprises about €3.2 billion in what the party terms “extra funding”, with the rest accounted for by allocations to allow for demographic pressures and the impact on health of any new pay agreement. Fianna Fáil promises €2 billion additional in health and also says it has allowed for demographic and pay pressures. Improving the system and implementing the Sláintecare plan is a massive challenge. The same complex job of implementation awaits in housing.The Green Party and Sinn Féin manifestos will present alternative strategies. The two big parties are promising more of the same by way of much higher spending in key problem areas, only with both claiming they can achieve better outcomes. Voters will look at what differences there are on spending and tax – and there are some. But if they are choosing between the two big parties, the key decision is who they believe will deliver more efficiently, or be able to steer the economy if trouble does hit.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4151718.1579961537!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"greens want 2 5bn a year spent on retrofitting houses","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party candidate Cllr Neasa Hourigan alongside party leader Eamon Ryan during the publication of the party’s manifes  in Dublin on Saturday. Photograph: PA   The State needs to increase spending on home insulation to at least €2.5 billion a year if it is to meet targets to cut emissions, according to the Green Party.Publishing their manifesto in Dublin on Saturday, the Greens claimed it was the only party capable of playing “senior hurling” on climate change.Its manifesto calls for a 7 per cent per year fall in emissions to reach the EU CO2 reduction target of a minimum 50 per cent by 2030.The Greens also want net zero emissions in Ireland by 2040, some ten years ahead of most other parties.Their manifesto does not give specific numbers for targets for housing, on tax measures and health spending (although it agreed that €5 billion in additional spending would be needed for Sláintecare over five years).It refused to do so because it said it did not want to get involved in a meaningless “auction” on promises.Party leader Eamon Ryan said if Ireland was to reach its emissions reduction goals it will need to spend a total of €50 billion over 20 years to retrofit 750,000 houses to improve energy efficiency.The Green Party said the State did not currently have the resources to retrofit homes at scale.As a first step the party is proposing allocating of €210 million per annum for retrofitting, and a budget of €40 million to train 20,000 workers who can specialise in this area.ManifestoMr Ryan said the party would increase funding for this once enough people had been trained.The manifesto was launched by Mr Ryan, by deputy leader Catherine Martin, Senator Pippa Hackett and Cllr Neasa Hourigan in the Radisson Blu Hotel in Dublin.The party has called for the investment in public transport to be doubled and it wants 20 per per cent of all transport funds ring-fenced for cycling and walking. It also proposes that all students in the State be entitled to free public transport, at a cost of €60 million per annum.It has also set an ambitious target of 5GW by 2030 and 30GW by 2040 of energy to come from offshore wind energy, generated on floating turbines in the Atlantic and Celtic Seas.The Green Party has also set a target of 700,000 solar panels on Irish homes as well as 50,000 on commercial premises. It has called for an immediate nationwide ban on smokey coal.On education, Ms Martin said the party wanted the pupil-teacher ration to drop from the current 25 to 1, to 20 to 1 over the lifetime of the next government.The manifesto also calls for social houses to be built on public land but, unlike other manifestos, the party has not specified how many, saying it would refuse to enter the “numbers auctions” of other parties.The Green manifesto also proposes ending oil and gas exploration, ban peat extraction, as well as rewetting 20 per cent of agricultural land.The manifesto does not contain much detail on cost, with Ms Hourigan saying the costs are similar to the ones in its pre-budgetary submission.Transport policiesAsked if its transport policies would mean some of the 60 road proposed projects would be mothballed, Mr Ryan replied his party could not stop everything. But he pointed out that not one cycling or walking project was being progressed at the moment.The Green party is not proposing tax cuts. Mr Ryan said the party’s priorities were climate change, housing, health and transport.“There is no point in giving tax cuts and then having people stuck in traffic for two and a half hours,” he said.The manifesto returned to a favourite Green theme of a basic income, which has been in its manifestos for over 30 years.“The idea is that nobody will be left behind, that everyone should have a basic income... We feel it will require a new Green Deal to achieve,” said Ms Hourigan.Mr Ryan said the main difference between his party and the others was on its approach to responding to climate change.He said that the big parties had showed a lack of ambition. Mr Ryan said there was nothing in the manifestos of the other parties to show how Ireland could reach its emissions targets.The party’s policies as they affect rural Ireland has been seen as a soft underbelly, confining its support to urban areas.Mr Ryan and Ms Hackett both rejected the argument that the Greens were against rural Ireland.“The fallacy of ’this will not be good for rural Ireland’ will have to stop,” he said.Ms Hackett said: “We have the money from the CAP budget. The model of farming (will need to) be shifted around. It will always be about producing food but we can produce better food, hand-in-hand with farmers doing bioersity, supporting habitats and rewetting lands.”Mr Ryan also paraphrased a comment made by a Fianna Fáil minister to the Greens when they first entered government 13 years ago to the effect they were now playing “senior hurling”.“We are the only party able to play senior hurling when it comes to climate change,” Mr Ryan asserted.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4150397.1579904878!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"men like seamus mallon don t come along too often","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSeamus Mallon was an architect of the Northern Ireland peace process and a key figure in negotiating the 1998 Belfast Agreement. Photograph: PALast night representatives of the SDLP’s foundation generation and current one reflected on the political and historic importance of Seamus Mallon, who has died after a short illness aged 83.“He was a giant of a man,” said his friend, Bríd Rodgers, a contemporary and former colleague in the Northern Executive where he served as deputy first minister from 1998 to 2001, with Ulster Unionist David Trimble as first minister.“Ireland has lost one of its most fierce champions for justice, equality and peace,” said present SDLP leader Colum Eastwood (36), recently elected as MP for Foyle.Mr Mallon from Markethill, Co Armagh, died on Friday. He was diagnosed with cancer late last year and, according to Ms Rodgers who last visited him on Christmas Eve, was prepared and reconciled for what was to come.And recalling their days from the civil rights movement of the 1960s, through to the foundation of the party and failed Sunningdale powersharing executive of 1974, to the heady days of the 1998 Belfast Agreement and, finally, the powersharing institutions just restored, Ms Rodgers characterised Mr Mallon as a politician with a “fixed moral compass”.She recalled also how he was assailed from many sides, including facing death threats, for the principled stances he took throughout his political life.‘A force of nature’Mr Eastwood said he joined the SDLP “because of people like Seamus Mallon”, describing him as “a force of nature”.Mr Mallon was a former teacher. He served as MP for Newry and Armagh and also as Assembly member for the same constituency. From 1979 he was deputy leader of the SDLP with John Hume as leader, both men viewed as pivotal in achieving the peace. The two had occasional differences but were respectful of each other.With John Hume quite ill it was last night left to his wife, Pat Hume, to pay tribute. “History will remember Seamus as one of the great Irish patriots and peacemakers,” she said.And she added: “Men like Seamus Mallon don’t come along too often.”Mr Mallon is predeceased by his wife Gertrude and is survived by his daughter Orla, son-in-law Mark and granddaughter Lara."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4150603.1579896187!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what are the differences between ff and fg election promises","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPostering in Dublin city centre  Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin Photograph: Nick Bradshaw Tax cuts versus spending increasesBoth parties say they will split future spending on a four to one ratio in favour of spending increases over tax cuts.TaxFine Gael wants to increase the threshold at which people hit the higher rate of income tax from €35,300 to €50,000, which it says will be worth €3,000 to the average earner if the policy is fully implemented. The threshold for the exemption from the Universal Social Charge would rise from€13,000 to€20,500. The tax free allowance for inheritance tax will remain at €335,000 for inheriting sons and daughters. For the next €250,000, a 20 per cent rate would apply and the normal 33 per rate would kick in on anything above €585,000.Fianna Fáil in government would reduce the 4.5 per cent USC rate to 3.5 per cent increase the standard rate income tax band by €3,000 for a single person and €6,000 for a couple increase the home carer tax credit to €2,000 increase the earned income tax credit to € 1,650 increase the income tax exemption limit for over 65s by €500 for a single person and € 1,000 for married couples introduce a € 600 rent tax credit and introduce a € 2,000 childminder tax credit. Capital gains tax would be cut from 33 per cent to 25 per cent.HousingFine Gael wants to provide between 35,000 and 40,000 homes per year and add 60,000 social houses over the next five years. It also proposes expanding the Help to Buy scheme, which currently provides an income tax and Dirt refund of €20,000 for first time buyers to be used for a deposit on new or self build homes. People living in towns with populations of less than 2,000 would be offered State owned sites at cost, which Fine Gael says would provide 8,600 homes.Fianna Fáil says it can increase housing supply to 200,000, including 50,000 new social and 50,000 new affordable homes. The party would introduce an SSIA style scheme for first time buyers, which would see the State top up the savings of first time buyers by 33 per cent to a limit of €10,000. It would apply to the purchase of new and second hand homes up the value of €500,000. The Help to Buy scheme would remain in place and the tax refund would increase from €20,000 to €25,000.HealthFine Gael says it would spend an extra €5 billion per year on health over the next five years. This would be used to fund an extra 2,600 hospital beds 4,500 community beds 5,000 extra nurses 80 additional primary care centres and diagnostic centres three elective hospitals in Dublin, Cork and Galway and 3,840 primary care workers. Daily hospital car parking charges would be capped at €10.Free GP care would be extended to everyone under the age of 18, the income limits for medical and GP visit cards would rise, and the threshold for medical cards for the over 70s will go back to 2012 levels. Fianna Fáil in power would allocate an extra €2 billion to the health sector and claims that Fine Gael’s €5 billion promise includes pre-existing commitments. Fianna Fáil wants an extra 2,600 hospital beds to reduce emergency department waiting times to four hours double funding to the National Treatment Purchase fund to €200 million recruit 1,000 extra consultants and 4,000 extra nurses expand free GP care increase home care hours by five million over a term of office increase funding to the Fair Deal scheme by €225million. Climate changeFine Gael says it would increase the retrofitting of homes by ten times current levels increase the take up of electric vehicles from 50 times current levels and consider a car scrappage scheme for the next budget plant an additional 440 million trees. Carbon tax would rise to €80 per tonne by 2030 with €6 billion of carbon tax revenues reinvested in climate measures. The party wants to invest €21.8 billion in climate projects through the capital investment plan. The sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned by 2030. There will also be new or increased levies on plastics and coffee cups. Carbon tax would be increased to €80 per tonne by Fianna Fáil and a new national infrastructure commission would be established to examine “30 year decarbonisation planning”. This commission would “oversee the long term plans for: decarbonising Ireland a strong public transport network that balances the economic needs of the country and the development of the rural regions”. A national retrofit scheme would also be rolled out diesel cars would be banned from cities from 2030,with a “complete removal” of fossil fuel cars from 2035.Education and Childcare Fine Gael says it will further decrease the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools from its current rate of 26:1, but does not set out a specific target. It says it will gradually increase funding for higher education, which will reach €100 million above existing levels by 2025. On childcare, the universal childcare subsidy will be increased from €20 per week to €100 per week by 2025.Fianna Fáil aims to reduce the pupil teach ratio to 20:1 by 2025 and would provide an extra €100 million per year to higher education. On childcare, the universal childcare subsidy will be increased from €20 per week to €80 per week by 2025.PensionsFine Gael would increase the weekly State pension by €5 per year. It would continue with the rise in the State pension age to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028. However, a new transition pension, equal to the State pension, for those over 66 would be introduced . For those aged 65, they would also receive a payment equal to the State pension but they would not have to sign on the dole or be seeking work.Fianna Fáil would increase the weekly State pension by €5 per year and wants to “establish a commission to examine the State pension age, and defer any further pension age increase pending its completion”. In the interim, a transition payment equal to the State pension will also be paid to those aged 65 and 66.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Flights cancelled and checkpoints set up in Wuhan as city remains on virtual lockdownAuthorities rush to build makeshift hospital as number of suspected cases nears 8,500WHO says it\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquotoo early\u0026rsquo to declare emergency as Scotland reports four suspected casesVerdict aimed at preventing threat of genocide rebuffs Aung San Suu Kyi\u0026rsquos assurancesVictims were American residents air tanker crashed while fighting fires in alpine regionWHO will determine on Thursday if outbreak constitutes a global health emergencyLast year Taiwan became the first Asian country to recognise same-sex marriageControversial new law seen as unconstitutional by opposition, causing months of protestSixth death in China where wider outbreak feared as hundreds of millions begin travelling for lunar new yearHealth commission confirms that coronavirus can spread from person to personCricket ball-sized hail stones smash windows and see residents sledding through streetsOver 60 cases of novel coronavirus identified in Wuhan amid fears it could spread furtherXi Jinping\u0026rsquos name appeared as \u0026ldquoMr S**thole when translated into EnglishAuthorities still battling nearly 100 fires despite heavy rain in eastern parts of countryUS to screen passengers at three major airports arriving on flights from WuhanRescuers save 30 trekkers following incident on Annapurna circuitFacial hair of diplomat, who has Japanese heritage, reminds Koreans of colonisationMany young couples reluctant to have children due to costs orce rates hit recordMelbourne braces for another wave of unhealthy air over weekend\u0026lsquoThese pines outlived the dinosaurs \u0026ndash we had to do everything we could to save them\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4149978.1579857872!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit european presidents sign withdrawal agreement","story":"There was mixed emotions among British MEPs as they cleared their offices in Brussels.

Speculation about his successor started immediately. Such speculation is based on the out-of-date idea that it matters who holds the job.Once upon a time, the Director-General did matter, for two reasons. The first was that he (always he, not she) exercised real editorial control, and therefore decided what was broadcast. The first Director-General, Sir John Reith, did this hence the phrase “Reithian values”. The second reason was that the BBC was so dominant in broadcasting that the person in charge of it was unassailably powerful.Whenever prime ministers got fed up with the BBC, they therefore used their right to appoint the corporation’s Chairman. The Chairman they chose would get rid of the “wrong” Director-General and put in the “right” one.Thus the Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson, wearied of his Left-wing former supporter, the Director-General Hugh Greene, and put in as Chairman a former Tory minister, Lord Hill, to edge him out. Thus Margaret Thatcher, furious at the BBC’s anti-Tory bias under the Director-General Alasdair Milne (father of Jeremy Corbyn’s lovable lieutenant, Seumas), made Marmaduke Hussey Chairman. In due time, Hussey appointed the highly effective moderniser John Birt as Director-General.Things are different now. The BBC is such a huge bureaucracy that no D-G can give it an editorial character. There are no “Hallian” values. Nowadays, its executives are entirely ensnared in their own processes. Look at the comical row about its rates of pay for women – for which the BBC’s only solution is spending much more licence-payers’ money.The bigger change is technological, and therefore competitive. Satellite and cable television, deregulation of radio, and then the internet and all its works have meant that you can watch or listen to British media all day, all your life, without ever having to use the BBC.Millions under the age of 40 do exactly that. But if you have any form of live terrestrial television on any device, you must pay the BBC £154.50 a year for a TV licence. If you fail to do so, you can be dragged to the magistrates’ court, where you will be fined up to £1,000. Nearly 200,000 people, most of them poor, are thus humiliated in court every year.Should the BBC TV licence fee be scrapped pollEven this scale of unjust persecution cannot prevent technological evasion, so the BBC’s revenue is starting to slide. The system looks doomed. Until quite recently, politicians were so scared of being trashed by the BBC that they dared not reform it. Indeed, the modernising project of David Cameron’s leadership was a way of getting kinder coverage from the BBC by seeming less Right-wing. Now alternative technologies, and the victory of Brexit after nearly four years of unremitting BBC opposition, have altered all that.Boris Johnson’s thumping majority has proved it is possible to win big without having to talk to the BBC on its terms. His party paid no electoral price for defying the traditional BBC invitation to come on and be humiliated. For the first time in the corporation’s century (due in 2022), it will have to get used to the feeling that the Government does not need it.How, then, should the Boris administration treat the BBC? It is being advised to avoid “trench warfare”. It is true that the soft Left will try to unite behind the proposition that the BBC is a “national treasure” which the Tories are trying to destroy. Its rhetoric is starting to equate the BBC with the NHS as a sacred cow. There might be some backlash, especially among more educated voters, against Tory “philistinism” and political interference.The danger of braking, however, is greater than that of accelerating. Big bureaucracies always try to win over their critics with soft words – the well-known phenomenon by which ministers “go native” among officials. This is already happening. Note the sudden prominence given on the BBC to the late, great Sir Roger Scruton, the Tory thinker whom, in life, it scorned.Don’t be fooled: much better to maintain the Dominic Cummings refusal to take the BBC at its own valuation. It is well worth any government’s while to harass the BBC when it lets slip its political views. As a chartered body funded by a compulsory licence fee, it has to take seriously all accusations of bias. And as a body with its own impermeable, uniform, would-be-right-on culture, it is frequently guilty as charged.Indeed, if the Left does try explicitly to turn the BBC into its fortress in the culture wars, that will only confirm what millions know already, that it has been such a fortress for decades. When I say “the Left”, I am not speaking in strictly party terms (though I am sure very few BBC high-ups vote Conservative). I mean the more generalised de haut en bas wokery which treats Greta Thunberg as Joan of Arc and the wider population as prejudiced idiots.At present, BBC News is running items under the title “Our Planet Matters”. Of course it matters. One resents the insulting implication that millions of us think it doesn’t. But in what sense is this news? Why are we forever being preached at and ticked off? The long story of the Brexit struggle has shown millions of Leave voters that the BBC despised them, and tried to deny their voice – for example, by weighting almost all panels and audiences on Question Time and Any Questions? against them. To jumble two well-known metaphors, Boris should strike while the iron has entered our souls.When Nick Robinson grilled me on the Today programme a few weeks ago, he warned me against a split society, such as that in the United States, where no media is shared by people of differing views. My answer was that such a split has already been created here – by the BBC. Of this, the Brexit story is the final proof.In terms of methods, however, it would be foolish – and wrong – for the Government to try to act like some exterior super-editor trying to “gag” the BBC. Except in egregious cases, the Government’s concern should be not particular programmes, but the system, especially the money.Future of the BBC | The best comment and analysisIn taking its stance, it is rightly looking at the issue from the point of view of the licence-payer. The phrase “poll tax” is an exactly correct description of the licence fee. Like all undifferentiated poll taxes, it bears heaviest on the poorest. And every year, the service has more and more free riders as the rising generation finds ways of not paying.There are two obvious steps to take. The first, already hinted at by the Government, is to decriminalise non-payment, turning it into an ordinary debt without the shame of a criminal court. The second would be to cut the licence fee substantially, say by half. Rather than trying to dictate what programmes should be cut, this would leave the decision to the BBC. For the first time, its “wider still and wider” doctrine would have to reverse. Then it would have to make up its mind what mattered, and how to keep it.I do not necessarily disagree that some things on the BBC – notably Radio 3 and 4 – are good for our culture. If they are, ways, such as subscription, can be found of paying for them. But let’s see what the public wants, instead of telling it what it must have.Coronavirus: Fears rise of Chinese cover-up as 56 million in lockdown and hospitals overwhelmedComment: The BBC is panicking at the public’s rejection of its arrogant Left-liberal worldviewScreen every soldier for PTSD warns former Helmand officer, as charity runs out of funding  UK flags could be lowered under cover of darkness as Brussels plans muted Brexit Day eventsSlimmers on 5:2 diet lose twice as much as weight as those trying \u0026#39Paleo\u0026#39Comment: Britain\u0026#39s jobs market is booming... here are some of the more curious new openingsComment: The folly of HS2 is a modern telling of the Seven Deadly SinsComment: Of course Trump should go - but it\u0026#39s the voters who should kick him out Coronavirus infection: everything you need to know about the outbreak from China Coronavirus: hunt for 2,000 travellers who flew from Wuhan to Britain in last fortnightPowerful earthquake hits Turkey, killing 20 and sending panicked residents onto the streetsWuhan woman \u0026#39cheated\u0026#39 coronavirus checks to fly out for Michelin-starred meal in FranceCoronavirus: How China\u0026#39s increasing global power could be influencing global virus responseHugh Laurie: Celebrities who turn down honours are \u0026#39pompous\u0026#39Donald Trump accused of lying about 34 US troops injured in Iran airstrikeScratch \u0026#39n\u0026#39 sniff patch developed to help vegans and vegetarians beat their craving for baconFraudsters in UK are \u0026#39operating with impunity\u0026#39 amid sharp rise in cases, report revealsThree children found dead at house in DublinMinister says railways are built \u0026#39for our children\u0026#39 in strongest hint yet that HS2 will go aheadWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/23/TELEMMGLPICT000222206116_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"coronavirus hunt 2000 travellers flew wuhan britain last fortnight","story":"The government will contact 2,000 travellers who landed in Britain on direct flights from Wuhan in the last 14 daysPublic health officials have teamed up with Border Force to trace 2,000 airline passengers who flew into Britain from Wuhan, China, in the past fortnight, to check if they are suffering symptoms of coronavirus.In a significant escalation of measures to prevent the deadly virus from spreading in the UK, the government said it would be tracking down those who could have been in the incubation period when they landed, but may have appeared symptomless. Flights from Wuhan are currently suspended, but following a meeting of the government\u0027s emergency committee, Cobra, the Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Witty announced that a Public Health hub of seven clinicians will now be established at Heathrow to monitor people coming from other parts of China.The official death toll in China has now risen to 41, with more than 1,300 confirmed cases. One of those killed was a doctor in China\u0027s Hubei province.So far, 14 people tested for coronavirus in Britain have been given the all-clear but checks are still ongoing on ‘a handful’ of new cases, and an expert at Public Health England (PHE) said it was ‘highly likely’ the virus would reach the UK. On Friday night, the first cases were confirmed in Europe as three patients were identified in France. Australia also reported its first case last night while Malaysia confirmed three cases.Speaking after Cobra, which was chaired by the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, Prof Witty, said: “We think there\u0027s a fair chance we may get some cases over time.“Of course this depends on whether this continues for a long time, or whether this turns out to be something which is brought under control relatively quickly.“I think we should definitely see this as a marathon, not a sprint we need to have our entire response based on that principle.”The Department of Health said most people who develop symptoms will get them after leaving the airport and so it was essential they knew what to do if they became ill. When asked why no physical tests were carried out on arrivals into the UK from Wuhan, before flights had stopped, Mr Whitty said: Every country does this slightly differently, that\u0027s always been the case.”He said that after a meeting of the Scientific Advisory Group of Experts, it was concluded: The screening would not really provide any appreciable increase in benefit for the UK public.Dr Paul Cosford, emeritus medical director for Public Health England (PHE) said: “There are no positive cases in the UK as yet, but we will go on testing and those numbers will of course change,” he told Radio 4’s Today programme. “I think it\u0027s highly likely that we will have cases in the UK, and of course every so often we do get new infections coming from the animal kingdom such as this one.”All the people tested in the UK are thought to have visited Wuhan and four out five patients tested in Scotland were from China, Downing Street said. This graphic shows how the virus can spread. How the coronavirus spreadsDr Cosford said anyone returning from China who experienced symptoms should avoid ‘pitching up’ at hospitals or their GP, and instead contact NHS 111.But he said that the majority of people would probably recover if they contracted the virus.The Chinese city of Wuhan is rapidly building a new 1,000-bed hospital to treat victims, while Disneyland Shanghai and parts of the Great Wall of China have been closed to visitors. Starbucks said on Friday that it would close all of its coffee shops in the Hubei province during the New Year holiday.It comes as China expanded severe travel limits to more than 18 cities, corralling at least 56 million million people in a wide-ranging quarantine as authorities desperately attempt to demonstrate that they are in control of the coronavirus ahead of Lunar New Year celebrations.All 70,000 of China’s cinemas, as well as attractions such as the Shanghai Disneyland and the Beijing stretch of the Great Wall of China, closed their doors.In Wuhan, the city at the epicentre of the outbreak, construction of a brand new 1,000-bed hospital - which the government pledged will be completed within a week - also began, amid concerns about a shortage of beds and equipment.But the virus has continued to spread internationally, with the United States recording a second infection - this time a woman in her 60s in Chicago. Singapore has now confirmed three cases, while Nepal has identified its first and Thailand its fifth.Private school groups are advising their members to consider planning for the possibility that pupils may not be able to travel during upcoming half term holidays in mid-February.A spokesperson for The Girls\u0027 Schools Association said “We are monitoring the situation carefully and are advising schools to consider planning for the eventuality that some pupils may not be able to travel home, or may choose not to travel home, for the half term or Easter holidays”.China sends more students to UK fee-paying schools than any other nation, data shows.The World Health Organization (WHO) is still refusing to declare an international public health emergency, which some experts said is ‘surprising.’In the past, the agency has been accused of overreacting to emerging pandemics, such as its response to bird flu in 2009.Dr Stephen Griffin, associate professor at the University of Leeds, said:  The proportion of severe cases appears high. My hope is that this is not a decision that we might come to regret.Peter Piot, professor of global health and director at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the outbreak is in a ‘critical phase’ in which intensified international collaboration and more resources was crucial.Coronavirus: Fears rise of Chinese cover-up as 56 million in lockdown and hospitals overwhelmedComment: The BBC is panicking at the public’s rejection of its arrogant Left-liberal worldviewScreen every soldier for PTSD warns former Helmand officer, as charity runs out of funding  UK flags could be lowered under cover of darkness as Brussels plans muted Brexit Day eventsSlimmers on 5:2 diet lose twice as much as weight as those trying \u0026#39Paleo\u0026#39Comment: Britain\u0026#39s jobs market is booming... here are some of the more curious new openingsComment: The folly of HS2 is a modern telling of the Seven Deadly SinsComment: Of course Trump should go - but it\u0026#39s the voters who should kick him out Coronavirus infection: everything you need to know about the outbreak from China Powerful earthquake hits Turkey, killing 20 and sending panicked residents onto the streetsWuhan woman \u0026#39cheated\u0026#39 coronavirus checks to fly out for Michelin-starred meal in FranceCoronavirus: How China\u0026#39s increasing global power could be influencing global virus responseHugh Laurie: Celebrities who turn down honours are \u0026#39pompous\u0026#39Donald Trump accused of lying about 34 US troops injured in Iran airstrikeScratch \u0026#39n\u0026#39 sniff patch developed to help vegans and vegetarians beat their craving for baconFraudsters in UK are \u0026#39operating with impunity\u0026#39 amid sharp rise in cases, report revealsThree children found dead at house in DublinBoris Johnson signs the Withdrawal Agreement - but a battle looms as France demands EU fishing rights for 25 years Minister says railways are built \u0026#39for our children\u0026#39 in strongest hint yet that HS2 will go aheadWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/global-health/2020/01/23/TELEMMGLPICT000222274640_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?im","title":"totalitarian china incapable telling truth virus","story":"Openness to science has not translated into openness for ordinary citizens.Beijing has got better at managing disease, but the desire for total control still leaves it exposedThe temples will not hold their fairs, the trains and planes will not run and the new movie releases, from Leap to Chinatown Detective 3, have been cancelled. China must spend this New Year holiday racing to detect and contain a new respiratory disease, the Wuhan coronavirus, which has killed at least 26 people and scientists think has spread to several thousand.There is good news. The virus is not as deadly as SARS. In fact, it is only about 10 times as deadly as seasonal flu, meaning 98 per cent of people who get it will survive (versus 85 per cent for SARS). While this isn’t exactly wonderful, it isn’t apocalyptic either. Crucially, however, China is managing the Wuhan virus very differently from how it managed SARS in 2003.According to Peter Kellam, a virus professor at Imperial College, the most important factor in managing a pandemic is “sharing”. This is hardly an area in which Chinese authorities have traditionally excelled, but for scientific purposes, both China and international institutions appear to have learned from Beijing’s disastrous attempt to cover up SARS. Scientists across the world have been given access to data like confirmed infection rates and the virus’s genome, allowing the system to gear up quickly, developing diagnostic tests and researching potential drugs. An inspection team from the World Health Organisation visited Wuhan this week and “commended” Chinese authorities for their handling of the crisis.As so often in China, however, the boundaries of freedom are strictly drawn. Official state media outlets have kept reporting low-key, placing news of the outbreak below reports of Xi Jinping’s latest marvellous speech. For now, non-state media have had their leash loosened, but they are ever-alert as to when it shortens again. Whether it is air pollution, anti-foreign rage or product contaminations, the pattern is the same. Periods of relative openness are followed by crackdowns before the debate gets “out of hand”.In some ways, a totalitarian regime might be seen as uniquely well-suited for handling a pandemic. Quarantining a zone of some 30 million people, as China is attempting around Wuhan, has never been done elsewhere. Beijing’s desire to build a surveillance network capable of tracking every single inidual always and everywhere sounds like it might be useful in tracing infection. And Westerners are dumbfounded to hear that the city’s authorities are erecting a new hospital within a week.Human adaptation to threat is not quite so straightforward, however. The desire for total control, and the illusion of having it, can be just as dangerous as it is efficient. On Monday, President Xi issued an edict commanding officials to put “safety and health” before all other objectives. Unfortunately, when you have built a political culture on lies and censorship, it is difficult to change the habits of a lifetime by decree.There are multiple reports suggesting that Wuhan city authorities leaned heavily on local media and hospitals to stop news of a new virus from spreading in the initial stages, and information is still being tightly controlled. Scientists abroad may well have been inspecting its genome well before locals were given any comprehensive information about the disease.From here, it might seem inconceivable to think that a government can control the spread of domestic news about a major disease outbreak involving a 30-million person quarantine during the busiest travel time of the year. But Beijing is experienced in such matters. In 2008, authorities permitted a cover-up that led to 300,000 babies being poisoned by contaminated milk formula in order to avoid embarrassment ahead of hosting the Olympics. And across the country, the real 20-40 million person death toll of Mao’s great famine, just two generations ago, is still not widely known.Where cover-ups become tricky is when they hit international scrutiny. It was New Zealand that blew the whistle on the poisoned formula scandal, just as it was the international backlash that made the suppression of SARS impossible and therefore highly politically damaging to the Communist Party. Clearly, the party has learned this lesson when it comes to managing disease.Quick spread of CoronavirusDomestically, however, Chinese citizens know full well that they rarely get the full story from their media or government. It might not directly affect medical collaboration abroad, but it undermines the trust needed to manage public responses during a crisis like a pandemic. If the government tells its citizens not to travel, to report suspicious symptoms or to take protective measures, for example, its advice is more likely to be heeded if it does not have a longstanding habit of lying. And in a really deadly epidemic, living under a government that views its people’s lives as disposable could rather change the calculus over whether to go and get tested for a suspected infection.More broadly, it is difficult to change ingrained habits in a system riddled with corruption and distrust. New diseases like the Wuhan virus, as well as bird and swine flu, are known to be especially liable to emerge from food systems in which live, wild game mixes freely with concentrated populations, cooking and slaughtering. Officially, trade in wild animals, from delicious-sounding wild duck to the rather less appealing civet cats and pangolins, is strictly controlled in China.In practice, undercover reporters find live specimens of the poor creatures on sale all over the place, like the market from which the Wuhan virus is thought to have originated. I’ve seen such a sight myself in a Chinese market, though it was about seven years ago: rows of sorry-looking, panting animals in cages or live insects being snapped in half right next to raw meat being prepped for cooking.For now, Chinese media are being given relatively free rein to report on the problem. But how long will it be before they investigate too far up the chain and cross the wrong person – some senior official with an interest in the trade, for example – and the window of freedom closes?Clearly, China’s management of disease has improved enormously in the last 15 years and we are all safer for it. But openness to science has not translated into openness for ordinary citizens. Unfortunately, this capricious boundary means that a society that produced outbreaks like SARS, H7N9 and a live swine flu epidemic that is even now devastating the country’s pork industry still cannot openly debate the question: “How does this keep happening to us?”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The crisis of confidence at the BBC – and make no mistake, it is a full blown, all alarm bells ringing, catastrophic crisis – is probably the most visible sign of the shift but it is much bigger than this.So bear with me: I promise that the whole column is not going to be about the BBC, even though it is easily the most infuriating and useful exemplar of the problem.But no, what could be about to implode is not just the sublime, unlimited self-regard of the broadcasters. It is nothing less than the whole interlocking set of preconceptions that are so embedded in the consciousness of those who decide what it is acceptable to think that they must ignore or traduce anything that contradicts them.Of course, self-doubt should have begun with the Brexit referendum result but that scarcely slowed them down: if a majority of the country were benighted bigots then it was up to the enlightened ones to lead them out of the darkness. Or to bully them out of it. And believe it or not, a good many of the Enlightened actually believed they had succeeded in this – hence the demand for a second referendum which would allow the masses to repent of their ignorance.Future of the BBC | The best comment and analysisThen came the general election which was, in effect, a second referendum. And that was the end. You could hear the sound of an edifice falling to the ground and smashing into pieces as you watched the television coverage of this cataclysm. It was such a resounding and utterly unexpected repudiation not just of the mindset of the BBC but of virtually all of the broadcast media – and the cultural circles in which their denizens travel – that it will probably be a generation before they recover. If they ever recover.Indeed, we must hope that the vainglorious arrogance never does return. What we want is not another set of sacred tenets which can be enforced with monolithic certainty, but humility: a genuinely liberal regard for differing opinions. But you know all this. Everybody knows it – except apparently the broadcast executives who are now running around in crazy circles like ants whose nest has been demolished.Presumably this sense of mission to enforce a moral doctrine and prescribe its rules to a grateful nation emerged from the post-war period when rationing and rebuilding dominated the country’s priorities. The most charitable interpretation of this phenomenon is that it began as a belief that it was the duty owed by the educated classes to British working people who had endured terrible deprivations and danger.If you listen to the patronising tone of the many public information pronouncements of the time, this is what you hear: we are going to create a new future with better housing, a fairer distribution of resources, state-run services and comprehensive health and welfare provision. You must trust our judgment in all things: we know better than you what is needed. Which is pretty much exactly the tone that the political descendants of those public policy managers adopt today, only now they are talking about climate change, multiculturalism, economic globalisation and gender identity.Arguably, a good many of the solutions that the Enlightened Benefactors imposed on society even in that earlier incarnation were wrong-headed or dangerously skewed by the political fashions of the time. Were vast council estates really a social improvement on the old Victorian terraces which might have been renovated rather than demolished? Were rationing and the nationalising of public services actually ways of ensuring fairness, or just a handicap to economic recovery?Lord Hall\u0026#039s message to all BBC staffBut at least back then it was plausible to claim that most people in the country bought into those beliefs. The trauma of the war had created a genuine sense of national unanimity. There had probably never been such widespread agreement on priorities and so much willingness to make sacrifices for the general good. If the specific programmes were questionable, they would be challenged only by a small and rather unpopular minority of sceptics.Needless to say, that is not the case with the doctrines being enforced by the great unidentifiable Authority now. Even if you accept that climate change is a fact, you might want to see less shrill alarmism and more attention paid to possible solutions that do not involve pauperising the developing world. (The BBC recently put Sir David Attenborough’s announcement of imminent climate crisis at the top of its main news bulletins. With great respect to the saintly Sir David, something that he says is not the most important news story of any day.)You may welcome migrants of all colours and backgrounds, and have limitless compassion for the disabled, without wishing to see classic literary texts re-written and programme presentation rotas designed to ensure their visibility. You may sympathise with the problems of sexual minorities but be disturbed by the proportion of attention that is devoted to their demands. In other words, you may be angry and frustrated by the implicit assumption that you and your reservations are beyond the pale.I am sure it is not an accident that adversaries of the official enlightened wisdom are only invited to participate in broadcast debate under the most loaded and disadvantaged circumstances, to be set against a solid phalanx of the upholders of Virtue – which is why so many of us have given up trying. It is really rather difficult to argue with people who think you don’t have a right to exist (quite literally, in the case of Israel).But the truth has finally hit.

Rudyard Kipling decided against a knighthood, and Evelyn Waugh turned down a CBE in the Fifties.Coronavirus: Fears rise of Chinese cover-up as 56 million in lockdown and hospitals overwhelmedComment: The BBC is panicking at the public’s rejection of its arrogant Left-liberal worldviewScreen every soldier for PTSD warns former Helmand officer, as charity runs out of funding  UK flags could be lowered under cover of darkness as Brussels plans muted Brexit Day eventsSlimmers on 5:2 diet lose twice as much as weight as those trying \u0026#39Paleo\u0026#39Comment: Britain\u0026#39s jobs market is booming... here are some of the more curious new openingsComment: The folly of HS2 is a modern telling of the Seven Deadly SinsComment: Of course Trump should go - but it\u0026#39s the voters who should kick him out Coronavirus infection: everything you need to know about the outbreak from China Coronavirus: hunt for 2,000 travellers who flew from Wuhan to Britain in last fortnightPowerful earthquake hits Turkey, killing 20 and sending panicked residents onto the streetsWuhan woman \u0026#39cheated\u0026#39 coronavirus checks to fly out for Michelin-starred meal in FranceCoronavirus: How China\u0026#39s increasing global power could be influencing global virus responseDonald Trump accused of lying about 34 US troops injured in Iran airstrikeScratch \u0026#39n\u0026#39 sniff patch developed to help vegans and vegetarians beat their craving for baconFraudsters in UK are \u0026#39operating with impunity\u0026#39 amid sharp rise in cases, report revealsThree children found dead at house in DublinMinister says railways are built \u0026#39for our children\u0026#39 in strongest hint yet that HS2 will go aheadComment: In the 21st century we should be able to imagine life without the BBC licence feeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/royal-family/2018/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000177366592_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imw","title":"job share vacant since harry meghan left","story":"Princess Eugenie, pictured with Jack Brooksbank, is back on InstagramWorkers of Britain, keep, erm, working – figures released this week revealed that employment is now at a joint all-time high. A record number of women working full-time (you’re welcome) were partly responsible for this boon, though a 0.2 per cent drop in job vacancies was also recorded. The latter of which seems surprising, given the number of high profile gigs up for grabs at the moment. Such as:Prince Harry’s arrival in his new home of Canada on Monday confirmed the Sussexes’ departure from the British bosom and thus an opening for a new royal “it” couple. Which Princess Eugenie seems very keen to fill, ending her months-long Instagram hiatus by posting a picture of herself and husband Jack Brooksbank in Buckingham Palace on Thursday.The tenth in line to the throne had been keeping a low profile following allegations surrounding her father, the Duke of York, that served up the unlikely double whammy of sullying both the monarchy and Pizza Express Woking. But the Harry and Meghan-shaped hole proved too golden an opportunity to pass up, with Eugenie’s return to social media a pertinent reminder that a young couple willing to live in their grandma’s palace in exchange for the odd flash of public engagement is always close at hand.Top contenders in the “you had one job” stakes are the Gloucester Marathon marshals who, in fairness, did marshal runners along the course – just in the wrong direction. This led to 15 participants in Sunday’s race being wrongly placed – including the winner – and one entrant being disqualified which, though not identifiably down to the marshals, was probably somehow their fault too.The race organisers intend to sue the (unnamed) marshalling firm for an approach that seemed to consist mostly of pointing and hoping for the best, while participants have shared their relief that “justice has prevailed.” It’s certainly put the 2020 Gloucester Cheese Rolling competition on the map. Not that having one will make any odds to the marshals.How to navigate the advent of Netflix, the licence fee furore and underpaying women to the tune of millions? By quitting as BBC Director General, to take the strategy employed by Lord Hall this week.The opening has apparently aroused much interest at No 10, where Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings are reported to have begun searching for a replacement “sympathetic to their aims”. The pair have not identified what it is about the corporation they find so egregious, yet are apparently certain it needs a “big change,” which is very specific and actionable advice.Future of the BBC | The best comment and analysisLast month, Cummings revealed his intention to hire “misfits and “weirdos” underlings that would eventually make his own role redundant. Was it all a set-up to facilitate his attempts on W1A? Stranger things have happened – not least his wardrobe choices a few days hence of two scarves, one jumper sleeve rolled up to the elbow and a miniature American football in hand. Cummings-era dress down Fridays at New Broadcasting House would be interesting, if nothing else.Sandi Toksvig is stepping down as the host of the Great British Bake Off, a programme in which amateur cooks fondle bread in a tent set to a running commentary of cake-themed pre-watershed smut. Laughing at the words “soggy bottom” for the eight zillionth time appears to have finally lost its allure for Toksvig, who has co-presented the programme since it moved to Channel 4 in 2017. Guesses as to who will replace her have abounded since: will it be Mel and Sue, Bake Off’s original hosts? Meghan Markle, now she’s able to pursue acting work again? Prince Andrew, given the impression that dough-based encounter in Woking more than two decades ago apparently made? Stay tuned.Designer Jean-Paul Gaultier gave his final catwalk show in Paris this week, bowing out after five decades of couture creations including “man skirts”, “granny hair” and Madonna’s 1990 cone bra. Having released an ‘80s dance tune, fronted late-night show Eurotrash (which also starred Carla Bruni and Melinda Messenger) and become a leading voice in the fight for men to take up wearing kilts, Gaultier’s departure from fashion will be keenly felt.Gigi Hadid walks the runway during the Jean-Paul Gaultier Haute Couture SpringSummer 2020 showThough given the advent of eco-pressures on designers, perhaps his exit is well timed – nobody wants a recyclable cardboard cone-boob catastrophe on their hands.Girlfriend for Laurence FoxBeing born into an acting dynasty must be awfully dull. This is surely why Laurence Fox has turned his hand to releasing albums (yes, multiple) bemoaning his orce, as well as appearing on Question Time to decry the censorious Britain in which we now live. One can hardly say anything these days, Fox protested, though he managed to squeeze in accusing a member of the audience of racism, criticising a film for featuring a Sikh actor as a WWI soldier and revealing he once ended a relationship because his other half was too “woke”. Won’t someone free Fox from the shackles of our authoritarian state?After the election bloodbath, Jeremy Corbyn called for a “period of reflection”. Helpfully for absolutely everybody except Labour, that period appeared to have either never begun or ended as soon as Rebecca Long Bailey entered the race to become leader – and was tipped to win.Read more | Labour leadership raceThat fanfare has since subsided, mercifully, with several unions giving their backing to candidates less confused as to whether their surnames contain a hyphen. At least “opposition leader” is now one of those rare things: a role with job security for the foreseeable.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

My mission to make our house more sustainable starts with thinking about making it warmer this week, I’ve been mostly thinking about thermostats.Given my day job is technology editor here at The Independent, it’s the technological solutions that seem most immediate. And starting with the thermostat seems an obvious one, given how much money and emissions are wasted on central heating.We recently got a smart thermostat, after struggling with a decidedly un-smart timer on our boiler. There was of course nothing green about that, given that it spent much of the time coming on when we weren’t even in. And there was plenty that wasn’t comfortable about it, either, since it would often be on when the house was too hot, or not in as we shivered in the cold. (In the end we gave up and mostly turned it off and on manually.)Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe have the Nest Thermostat E. (Nest, which is now owned by Google, are probably the most famous of the smart home companies, and the thermostat is probably their most famous product the E supposedly stands for a variety of things including “easy” and “energy-saving”, but basically means that it’s the cheaper version.) It works by getting your location and learning how you tend to like your heating, setting up a smart schedule and turning the heating off when you’re not there.So since the beginning of the year I’ve been thinking about how best we can optimise the amount of energy that thermostat uses. Though it is smart, it still works on what you tell it as such, you can change what sort of temperature you want it to be.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

So the main thing I’ve done is turn the heating down before we get into bed, ensuring that we aren’t wasting heat that will only be around once we’ve gone to bed. (Another of my personal pledges for 2020 is to ensure that I pay full attention to my sleep, after reading Matthew Walker’s luminous book on the subject, and this helps with that too.)Why I\u0027m making my home more eco-friendlyThe Nest gives you a leaf when you’re being energy-\u0026nbspand eco-conscious by having the temperature lower than it might expect. And I feel generally rewarded, too: while there’s no real way to know the impact this is having on our own gas usage, it feels like we almost certainly are saving energy.Smart thermostats – or, if you are like me and didn’t have a non-smart one before, any kind of thermostat – feel like a wonderful symbol of how easy it can be to be more efficient. As it turns out, we aren’t much colder our house is still heated when we need it. It’s just that it won’t be heated when we’re not there, or when we’re already warm enough. Saving money and emissions on heating has actually made life easier.Getting one is expensive, of course: the Nest Thermostat E is £199, and you’ll have to pay for installation if you live in a confusing, complicated house like ours. But most people probably won’t need to, and there are plenty of deals and discount schemes from energy companies that should make it a little more easy to swallow.I suspect, as we head through the year of making our house more sustainable, that not all the changes we make will be quite so seamless, comfortable or sacrifice free. But I certainly hope so, because this feels like the kind of change that is incredibly nice to make, not only helping save the world in the tiniest way, but also saving money, and saving us from being cold.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He describes himself as funny, caring and considerate – a well-rounded person. His celebrity crush is Aladdin star Naomi Scott.Ollie is an estate owner and heir to the Lanhydrock estate in Cornwall. He claims to be an alpha male but expects to be the butt of all jokes. He\u0027s a self-confessed attention-seeker who wears his emotions on his sleeve. His celebrity crush is Lily James.Meanwhile, the show has been sponsored by fast fashion brands (Missguided and then I Saw it First) for the last three years, giving viewers the opportunity to shop the female Islanders’ looks directly. Personally, I’ve always thought that Love Island contestants dress terribly: it’s Benidorm beaches meets Kardashian kitsch. But with prices starting at £5, the clothes are devastatingly cheap. Far cheaper than the designer garb we see on most TV stars. So I can understand the appeal. But I also know that every time someone buys one of those bikinis, or sparkly bodycon dresses, they’re adding fuel to fast fashion’s ever-blazing fire.But perhaps the onus is not on the consumer, or even the Love Island star. Lauren Bravo, author of How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, explains that the brands are the ones who should really be shouldering responsibility here. “These days we’re so used to instant gratification, and the idea that anyone can aspire to celebrity, that it seems reasonable for TV stars to sell us clothes and vice versa,” she tells me. “And it’s really hard, because I know what it’s like to love fashion and crave the clothes you’re seeing on people you admire, not to mention the huge social pressures on young people to keep that endless parade of new looks rolling over on their Instagram grid, so telling people who can’t necessarily afford to spend any more that their shopping habits are destroying the planet can feel snobbish and unfair.”Why I\u0027m giving up fast fashion #20PledgesBut, Bravo adds, the fact remains that those clothes simply cannot be made as cheaply as they’re sold. Somewhere down the line, someone is paying the price, whether it’s a garment worker barely surviving on poverty wages or a community grappling with industrial pollution.That’s not to say you can’t “get the Islander look” in a sustainable and eco-friendly way. Bravo suggests heading to secondhand shopping apps, like Depop, where you’ll find plenty of pre-loved items not dissimilar from the ones you see on the show. Some of them will be from fast fashion brands, but if you’re buying it there, you’re keeping that item in circulation as opposed to letting it wind up in landfill.\u0026nbspOr, you could take a closer look at some of the trends championed by Love Islanders, both past and present, and see that many (cycling shorts, mesh, high-waisted jeans and leopard print) hark back to another era, like, say, the 1990s. And what better way to shop Nineties fashion than by heading to your local Beyond Retro or Rokit, which will be jam-packed with original clothing from the decade that is not only more sustainable, but a hell of a lot cooler, too.How to Break Up with Fast Fashion by Lauren Bravo (£12.99, Headline Home) is out nowOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension.

But she added the bank would always be governed by its mandate to achieve price stability.The idea that the ECB will adjust its policy to help fight climate change has been at the top of the agenda since Lagarde was appointed president late last year.\u0026nbspShe acknowledged that the debate over the ECB’s role would be controversial and spark criticism. “Is there going to be mandate creep? Isn’t that going to be a distraction? Why should it be the role of central banks?” she gave as examples.She insisted the greater danger was to do nothing. “Failing to try is already failing,” she said, adding that the ECB should consider every area where it could participate in an agenda shared by the European Commission and many eurozone leaders.She insisted that the review would be open to alternative views from within the ECB’s governing council. “I’m not a despotic president of the governing council — all views are welcome,” she said.Earlier the bank said that decided to keep its interest rates on hold, as had been expected. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00 per cent, 0.25 per cent and -0.50 per cent respectively.Lagarde said that rates would stay at their historic inflation level until the bank saw inflation get a level “sufficiently” close to its 2 per cent target.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is patently absurd to compare Takeaway with Amazon when evaluating the outlook for future competition.”The decision to open up a probe came after the CMA said it had “reconsidered its position” more than six months after Takeaway first bid for Just Eat.The competition watchdog said: “Information we now have available to us suggests that Takeaway could have been well-placed to enter the UK market, if the merger hadn’t happened, and compete with Just Eat – so it’s important we open a formal investigation to find out more about this.“Ultimately, our job is to protect UK consumers. Merging businesses can always choose to formally notify a merger to the CMA if they want to avoid the risk that the deal could be called in for investigation at a later stage – and Takeaway chose not to do this.”The CMA said that it could not be specific about the new information it had received. Cat Rock urged the regulator to complete its work quickly so that the deal could be completed.Earlier this month Just Eat shareholders agreed to a £5.9bn all-share offer from Takeaway after a drawn-out battle with rival bidder Prosus.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Its reading of 52.9, up from 50.0 in December, was also at a 16-month high, while the rebound in manufacturing to an eight-month high of 49.5 was not enough to tip over the line into expansion.Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg\u0026nbspBank, said that the jump in the PMI for January provides yet more evidence that UK economic activity has started to turn up sharply since the election.“Brexit progress, the promise of a big fiscal stimulus in spring, and the end of the risk that far-left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn could one day become prime minister have lifted confidence and lowered uncertainty,” he said.Market traders pared back their prediction of the likelihood of a rate cut from 70 per cent on Friday to less than 50 per cent after the release of the\u0026nbspPMI data.Simon Wells, chief European economist\u0026nbspat HSBC, said that, on balance, he believed the PMI survey would keep the Bank of England on hold at the last meeting of its monetary policy committee to be chaired by outgoing governor Mark Carney.However, he added: “Before the market races to price out any chance of rate cuts this year, it is worth keeping in mind that GDP and retail sales data were very weak, and inflation has been soft.“The PMI is still consistent with a 0.2 per cent quarterly GDP growth rate, in line with the BoE\u0027s November forecast, and still fairly sluggish. We therefore still think a rate cut could happen in May, although January now looks less likely.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This was the lowest since the aftermath of the global financial crisis in the final quarter of 2009 when it hit 9.5 per cent.The fall was driven by a sharp fall in profits in the North Sea oil and gas, that slimmed to 1.3 per cent from 2.3 per cent as the prices of both fuels fell in the third quarter.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, the drop in profits was witnessed across business with services firms suffering a 0.4 points fall to 15.2 per cent and manufacturers down by a steeper 0.9 points to 11.1 per cent.Earlier this week figures showed the number of firms issuing profits warnings hit a four-year high in the final quarter of last year, according to business advisers EY.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gabriella Zaghari-Ratcliffe stands next to her father Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and his mother Barbara, as they address the media in Downing Street following a meeting with Prime Minister Boris JohnsonRosa Connolly takes a close look during a preview of the Tyrannosaurs exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland, EdinburghThe sun sets behind tower cranes and the London skyline in the city financial districtPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, speaks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson as they attend the UK-Africa Investment Summit at the Intercontinental Hotel in London.

The share of companies warning in 2019 hit 17.8 per cent, just surpassing 2008’s figure at the peak of the financial crisis. A third of FTSE-listed retailers issued warnings in 2019.The figures came as the retail industry said shops shed 57,000 jobs in 2019 as employment in the once-vibrant high street and shopping centre contracted for the fourth successive year.The British Retail Consortium said the total number of retail employees fell by 1.8 per cent in the final three months of 2019 compared with a year earlier.

Savers in countries such as Germany have grown angry at near-zero savings rates.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe said that for the first 10 years of the ECB’s life its goal was to fight high levels of inflation. “The financial crisis was the pivotal point at which eventually inflation was too low, so it’s been a reversal of the situation. It requires that we look at the strategy very carefully and how effective we can be.”The process is expected to conclude by the end of 2020 and Lagarde declined to say if any decisions had been taken. “I would not include, exclude or anticipate how we are going to deliver it,” she said.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

But she added the bank would always be governed by its mandate to achieve price stability.The idea that the ECB will adjust its policy to help fight climate change has been at the top of the agenda since Lagarde was appointed president late last year.\u0026nbspShe acknowledged that the debate over the ECB’s role would be controversial and spark criticism. “Is there going to be mandate creep? Isn’t that going to be a distraction? Why should it be the role of central banks?” she gave as examples.She insisted the greater danger was to do nothing. “Failing to try is already failing,” she said, adding that the ECB should consider every area where it could participate in an agenda shared by the European Commission and many eurozone leaders.She insisted that the review would be open to alternative views from within the ECB’s governing council. “I’m not a despotic president of the governing council — all views are welcome,” she said.Earlier the bank said that decided to keep its interest rates on hold, as had been expected. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00 per cent, 0.25 per cent and -0.50 per cent respectively.Lagarde said that rates would stay at their historic inflation level until the bank saw inflation get a level “sufficiently” close to its 2 per cent target.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The voluntary agreements between different industry players have not yielded the desired results.Apple set to release cheaper and smaller iPhone, report saysBut Apple rejected that characterisation, suggesting that phone manufacturers had actually unified around two different ports. All iPhones have used its Lightning cable for nearly a decade, and most new Android phones use USB-C, it pointed out, claiming that this approach does work.Apple is unlikely to license its proprietary Lightning port to other phone manufacturers, meaning that any new EU rule would almost certainly mean the company would be forced to switch to a new port. That would mean Apple customers throwing away their wires and other accessories, the company claimed, which would have a direct negative impact by disrupting the hundreds of millions of active devices and accessories used by our European customers and even more Apple customers worldwide, creating an unprecedented volume of electronic waste and greatly inconveniencing users.Instead, Apple suggested that regulators should\u0026nbspfocus on the other end of the wire, where the charging cable plugs into the power. Unifying those ports would allow users to plug their charging cables into similar ports\u0026nbsp– in hotel rooms or\u0026nbspcafés, for instance – no matter what plug was on their phone.We do not believe there is a case for regulation given the industry is already moving to the use of\u0026nbspUSB\u0026nbspType-C through a connector or cable assembly, Apple said in its statement. This includes Apple’s\u0026nbspUSB-C\u0026nbsppower adapter which is compatible with all iPhone and\u0026nbspiPad\u0026nbspdevices. This approach is more affordable and convenient for consumers, enables charging for a wide range of portable electronic products, encourages people to re-use their charger and allows for innovation.The Lightning port was introduced in 2012, with the iPhone 5, as a replacement for Apple\u0027s old 30-pin connector. Since then it has been used on almost every one of Apple\u0027s portable devices, though the recent iPad Pro uses the industry standard USB-C port.Apple gave no firm indication that it would stick with the existing Lightning port in its iPhones. It has been rumoured that the company is moving towards getting rid of the charging port entirely, and recent handsets have included wireless charging that does away with the need for a wire.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But eagle-eyed royal fans spotted a mistake in the trailer for the third season. When Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth II is shown celebrating her 1977 Silver Jubilee, the voiceover gets the date of the Queen’s coronation wrong by a year, saying the Silver jubilee was 25 years after the Coronation. It was actually 24 years, as her coronation took place on June 2, 1953.  The ITV fish-out-of-water detective drama stars Rob Lowe as a US police chief who moves to the UK to take up the role of Chief Constable with East Lincolnshire police. He wears four medal ribbons – Diamond Jubilee Medal, Golden Jubilee Medal, Queen\u0027s Police Medal and Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. The trouble is not only are they in the wrong order, but he shouldn’t be wearing any of them. He’s an American who hasn’t previously served in the British police.Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) states that his sister Samantha was abducted by aliens but his recollections of it are contradictory. During hypnotherapy regression therapy, he says he was unable to move at the time, but during flashbacks, he is perfectly able to do so. Mulder is also seen wearing a wedding ring in the season five episode “Travellers. Why had he never mentioned being married? In reality, Duchovny had recently got married. But it added a big change to Mulder’s past.How old is the Doctor? In the classic-era he states he’s anywhere between 500 to several thousand years old. But in the revived series, David Tennant’s Doctor claims he is 904 years old. Unless he’s lying, somewhere along the line, the continuity has slipped up.During Ralphie’s death scene in his kitchen, Tony Soprano is almost blinded by a can of spray, but knocks Ralphie to the floor and kills him. The scene was meant to end with Tony putting his hands on the counter and gasping for air but James Gandolfini, who brilliantly plays Tony, accidentally put his hand down on the oven’s lit burners. The cry of pain was real – but this mistake worked perfectly for the scene.622 Game of Thrones The greatest oops moment in GoT’s was in the final season when a stray Starbucks cup is sitting on a wooden table next to Emilia Clarke’s character Daenerys Targaryen. Did nobody spot it? There were also plastic water bottles near Samwell Tarly’s and Ser Davos’s feet in the final episode.When Marge tells Homer she is pregnant with Maggie in the episode “And Maggie Makes Three”, which first aired in 1995, a picture of Maggie can be seen hanging on the wall of the living room – a right clanger – considering this is before she is even born.The second season of the TV drama is set in October 1984 – a year after the first season. Considering the show trades in nostalgia, you would have thought they\u0027d get the soundtrack right – but they didn’t. Mistakes include The Smith\u0027s song There is a Light That Never Goes Out playing in the background during a flashback between Will and Jonathan. Trouble is, this particular Smiths song wasn\u0027t released until 1986. There was also a motoring error: Barb\u0027s Volkswagon Cabrio was actually made in 1988. In the first season’s episode Provenance, it seems that the actors got a bit lazy, referring to characters by their real names, not their character’s name. Dean appears to call his brother “Jared”, when the character’s name is Sam Winchester and an extra calls the character Dean Winchester “Jensen”, which is again the name of the actor who plays him. It’s one of those shows in which fans searched for hidden clues and meanings. But they picked up on more than intended. In the plane crash scene in the first episode, right before the turbine explodes, a mysterious dark object sweeps upwards only visible to fans sifting through the scene frame by frame. Was it an early manifestation of the smoke monster? No, according to producers, it was just a CGI error.More name mix-ups occur early on in the long-running US sitcom. The aspiring actress Penny, played by Kaley Cuoco, refers to her dad as “Bob”, but once he’s introduced on the show, he is called “Wyatt”. Also there is a plot mistake regarding the broken elevator in the apartment building. When they lug the time machine up the stairs in season one, Leonard explains to Howard that the elevator has been broken for two years. But Howard should know this considering he was there when Leonard blew it up. This is revealed during a flash back in a later episode, where it also states that the event took place five years ago, not two.The BBC hit drama had a continuity error when its star Suranne Jones is seen drinking a glass of wine in her kitchen. As she gulps the wine and texts from her phone, the fridge door in the background is open, then closed, then open – all by itself.1322 Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season one establishes that vampires have no breath – it\u0027s confirmed when Angel is unable to perform CPR. But the vampires talk, pant and even smoke – all which require breathing – while Spike is even tortured by drowning.During a scene in season nine, episode 15 (“The One with the Mugging”), Jennifer Aniston was replaced with a stand-in while her character Rachel was still in shot. She sits at the table at the edge of the frame and is even wearing a different top. In another scene, Phoebe, is chatting to her friend  Monica, but it’s not Monica. It’s Courteney Cox’s body double who has been left carelessly in the shot.Fans laughed out loud when Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) finds Seb Franklin (Harry Visinoni) injured on the pavement and picks up her mobile to call emergency services. She managed to do it without touching the screen, unlocking her phone or dialling any numbers.1622 Malcolm in the MiddleIn the US sitcom about a dysfunctional family, when Lois walks out holding her ruined dress that is soaking wet to confront her kids, there is a crew member crouching in the hallway holding a bucket.The heartthrob paediatrician Doug Ross, played by George Clooney, had a son prior to his romance with Carol – or did he? Although he mentions the son a few times in season one, he claims later in the series not to have any children.In the first episode of this sci-fi series, the steering wheel has disappeared from the set of the spaceship. Serenity’s pilot Wash, played by Alan Tudyk, can be seen improvising with his hands around an imaginary wheel. It’s hard to believe this mistake wasn’t caught.The mistake actually ended up changing the plot of the series. Supposedly, David Lynch accidentally caught the crew member Frank Silva on camera when his reflection appeared in a mirror in a scene when Laura Palmer was shown screaming. Lynch liked it so much that he decided to keep it in and cast Silva as the character Killer Bob, a dark spirit who haunts Laura.2022 Two and a Half Men Charlie Sheen is seen talking on an upside down iPhone while sitting in a flash red car with a sexily clad woman next to him.The whopper of a mistake did not happen on screen, but in a promotional shot posted online. It was a surprise to see a plastic water bottle perched on the mantle piece behind the Earl of Grantham and Lady Edith considering the series is set in the 1920s. Other mistakes onscreen include a TV aerial on top of a house and double yellow lines on the road.More name mix-ups occur early on in the long-running US sitcom.

The cry of pain was real – but this mistake worked perfectly for the scene.622 Game of Thrones The greatest oops moment in GoT’s was in the final season when a stray Starbucks cup is sitting on a wooden table next to Emilia Clarke’s character Daenerys Targaryen.

Considering the show trades in nostalgia, you would have thought they\u0027d get the soundtrack right – but they didn’t. Mistakes include The Smith\u0027s song There is a Light That Never Goes Out playing in the background during a flashback between Will and Jonathan. Trouble is, this particular Smiths song wasn\u0027t released until 1986. There was also a motoring error: Barb\u0027s Volkswagon Cabrio was actually made in 1988. In the first season’s episode Provenance, it seems that the actors got a bit lazy, referring to characters by their real names, not their character’s name. Dean appears to call his brother “Jared”, when the character’s name is Sam Winchester and an extra calls the character Dean Winchester “Jensen”, which is again the name of the actor who plays him. It’s one of those shows in which fans searched for hidden clues and meanings. But they picked up on more than intended. In the plane crash scene in the first episode, right before the turbine explodes, a mysterious dark object sweeps upwards only visible to fans sifting through the scene frame by frame. Was it an early manifestation of the smoke monster? No, according to producers, it was just a CGI error.More name mix-ups occur early on in the long-running US sitcom. The aspiring actress Penny, played by Kaley Cuoco, refers to her dad as “Bob”, but once he’s introduced on the show, he is called “Wyatt”. Also there is a plot mistake regarding the broken elevator in the apartment building. When they lug the time machine up the stairs in season one, Leonard explains to Howard that the elevator has been broken for two years. But Howard should know this considering he was there when Leonard blew it up. This is revealed during a flash back in a later episode, where it also states that the event took place five years ago, not two.The BBC hit drama had a continuity error when its star Suranne Jones is seen drinking a glass of wine in her kitchen.

Serenity’s pilot Wash, played by Alan Tudyk, can be seen improvising with his hands around an imaginary wheel. It’s hard to believe this mistake wasn’t caught.The mistake actually ended up changing the plot of the series. Supposedly, David Lynch accidentally caught the crew member Frank Silva on camera when his reflection appeared in a mirror in a scene when Laura Palmer was shown screaming. Lynch liked it so much that he decided to keep it in and cast Silva as the character Killer Bob, a dark spirit who haunts Laura.2022 Two and a Half Men Charlie Sheen is seen talking on an upside down iPhone while sitting in a flash red car with a sexily clad woman next to him.The whopper of a mistake did not happen on screen, but in a promotional shot posted online. It was a surprise to see a plastic water bottle perched on the mantle piece behind the Earl of Grantham and Lady Edith considering the series is set in the 1920s. Other mistakes onscreen include a TV aerial on top of a house and double yellow lines on the road.More name mix-ups occur early on in the long-running US sitcom.

So even the Amigos, Mariah Carey, Michelle Obama and the rest was just a lie.”“Who thought James drove that car the entire time he is talking and singing?” another said.“I have seen James\u0027 eyes on the road 30 per cent of the times that he is driving. I wondered how he didn’t crash. I actually feel better now.”“However, on the rare occasion when there is a stunt component and the producers feel it is unsafe to drive, we will use a rig.”Justin Bieber\u0026nbspis preparing to release a new album\u0026nbspfollowing the release of his single “Yummy” earlier this month.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, due to over-fishing and the industrialisation of food production, the iconic snack is now said to contain only 20 per cent fish or less, with substitute ingredients such as flour, chemical enhancers, pork and lard sometimes making up the bulk of the product.

It is patently absurd to compare Takeaway with Amazon when evaluating the outlook for future competition.”The decision to open up a probe came after the CMA said it had “reconsidered its position” more than six months after Takeaway first bid for Just Eat.The competition watchdog said: “Information we now have available to us suggests that Takeaway could have been well-placed to enter the UK market, if the merger hadn’t happened, and compete with Just Eat – so it’s important we open a formal investigation to find out more about this.“Ultimately, our job is to protect UK consumers. Merging businesses can always choose to formally notify a merger to the CMA if they want to avoid the risk that the deal could be called in for investigation at a later stage – and Takeaway chose not to do this.”The CMA said that it could not be specific about the new information it had received. Cat Rock urged the regulator to complete its work quickly so that the deal could be completed.Earlier this month Just Eat shareholders agreed to a £5.9bn all-share offer from Takeaway after a drawn-out battle with rival bidder Prosus.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They needed to cook for two hours on the International Space Station, compared with less than 20 minutes on Earth.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThere\u0027s still a lot to look into to figure out really what\u0027s driving that difference, but definitely a cool result, Mary Murphy, a manager for Texas-based Nanoracks, said this week. Overall, I think it\u0027s a pretty awesome first experiment.Nobody\u0026nbspyet knows what they taste like because they were sealed into inidual pouches and packed for\u0026nbspspaceflight. They have since been brought back to Earth on a\u0026nbspSpaceX\u0026nbspcapsule, and are frozen in a lab near Houston, Texas.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Five frozen raw cookies were already up there.Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano was the master baker in December, radioing down a description as he baked them one by one in the prototype Zero G Oven.SpaceX to send Nasa astronauts to space soon, Elon Musk saysThe first cookie — in the oven for 25 minutes at 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius) — ended up seriously under-baked. He more than doubled the baking time for the next two, and the results were still so-so.The fourth cookie stayed in the oven for two hours, and finally success.So this time, I do see some browning, Parmitano radioed. I can\u0027t tell you whether it\u0027s cooked all the way or not, but it certainly doesn\u0027t look like cookie dough any more.Parmitano cranked the oven up to its maximum 325 degrees F (163 degrees C) for the fifth cookie and baked it for 130 minutes. He reported more success.Additional testing is required to determine whether the three returned cookies are safe to eat.As for aroma, the astronauts could smell the cookies when they removed them from the oven, except for the first.That\u0027s the beauty of baking in space, according to former NASA astronaut Mike Massimino. He now teaches at Columbia University and is a paid spokesman for DoubleTree by Hilton. The hotel chain provided the cookie dough, the same kind used for cookies offered to hotel guests. It\u0027s offering one of the space-baked cookies to the Smithsonian Institution\u0027s National Air and Space Museum for display.The reminder of home, the connection with home, I think, can\u0027t be overstated, Massimino said. From my personal experience ... food is pretty important for not just nutrition but also for morale in keeping people connected to their home and their Earth.Eating something other than dehydrated or prepackaged food will be particularly important as astronauts head back to the moon and on to Mars.Nanoracks and Zero G Kitchen, a New York City startup that collaborated with the experiment, are considering more experiments for the orbiting oven and possibly more space appliances. What\u0027s in orbit now are essentially food warmers.There\u0027s an added bonus of having freshly baked cookies in space.We made space cookies and milk for Santa this year, NASA astronaut Christina Koch tweeted.Additional reporting by Associated PressBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s a depressing fact that films directed by previous winners have more chance of being nominated than those directed by newcomers.Because of this, the\u0026nbspbest film in any given year almost never wins the evening’s most coveted prize – in fact, it’s sometimes\u0026nbspnot even\u0026nbspnominated in the first place.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOver the decades, there have been countless glaring omissions\u0026nbsp– films that were nominated but were beaten by far inferior films\u0026nbspand classic films\u0026nbspthat failed to secure a single nomination.As the 2020 Oscars approach – a ceremony that’s fast becoming a two-horse race between a film that actually deserves the top prize (Parasite) and a film that does not (1917) – we’ve run through 20 brilliant films that you would have expected to be a\u0026nbspBest Picture winner, but weren’t.Click through the bellow gallery to see what films made the listCreated with Sketch.Oscars: 21 great films that never won Best Picture Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Long revered as one of the greatest films ever made, Orson Welles\u0027 debut – a film following newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane – was just another nominee back in the day, losing out to How Green Was My Valley. The Searchers may be considered John Ford\u0027s greatest film, but it was not treated as such back in the 1950s. In fact, the western starring John Wayne failed to earn a single nomination. Around the World in 80 Days turned out to be more the Academy\u0027s cup of tea.Not only did Alfred Hitchcock never win an Oscar (save for his memorial award in 1968), but neither did any of his films – one of which is Vertigo, a classic that won Sight \u0026amp Sound\u0027s once-a-decade greatest films of all time poll in 2012. If it had been nominated, it would have faced stiff competition in the form of eventual winner All About Eve.One of the films that kickstarted the New Hollywood Cinema era, The Graduate may have won director Mike Nichols an Oscar, but it ultimately lost out to Norman Jewison\u0027s In the Heat of the Night.  Stanley Kubrick\u0027s sci-fi classic remains one of the most influential pieces of cinema there is. The Academy didn\u0027t agree. The Academy nominated Kubrick for Best Director and awarded the visual effects in favour of considering 2001 for Best Picture (it didn\u0027t even get nominated). That year\u0027s winner was Oliver!, the musical by Carol Reed.Despite Taxi Driver\u0027s failure to win the main award, its nomination in four categories showed the Academy had good intentions. That All the President\u0027s Men and Network also lost out to eventual winner Rocky shows that, ultimately, it never really stood a chance.Francis Ford Coppola\u0027s ambitious Vietnam War epic Apocalypse Now received a grand total of eight nominations, but only went home with two prizes (for cinematography and sound) losing out to drama Kramer vs. Kramer.Of all the Oscar blows dealt to Martin Scorsese over the decades, none landed harder than Raging Bull losing out to Robert Redford\u0027s weepie Ordinary People, an oversight many consider one of the Academy\u0027s most egregious.  Another sci-fi classic overlooked by the Oscars was Blade Runner, which didn\u0027t even get nominated in the Best Picture category (Gandhi ended up winning). Ridley Scott\u0027s The Martian went on to receive seven nominations in 2017 – evidence, perhaps, of the Academy taking responsibility for its past errors.1023 Do the Right Thing (1989)Spike Lee\u0027s Do the Right Thing failing to win Best Picture at the 1990 Oscars is one thing – losing out to Driving Miss Daisy is another thing altogether.   Having awarded both The Godfather Part I and The Godfather Part II Best Picture in 1972 and 1974 respectively, the Academy seemed destined to appreciate Martin Scorsese\u0027s Goodfellas. But no – Kevin Costner\u0027s directorial debut Dances with Wolves was the most appealing choice for voters.New talent on the block Quentin Tarantino\u0027s second feature Pulp Fiction won him the coveted Palme d\u0027Or at Cannes in 1994 – a success he failed to match back on home turf. While he won an Original Screenplay Oscar, his film was beaten by Forrest Gump......and it wasn\u0027t the only one. Frank Darabont\u0027s adaptation of Stephen King\u0027s prison-set novella The Shawshank Redemption also fell victim to Robert Zemeckis\u0027 Oscar-friendly Forrest Gump. We don\u0027t see that film sitting atop the IMDb top 250 though, do we?If Heat was released today, there\u0027s no way it wouldn\u0027t be a Best Picture frontrunner. That it was completely ignored in favour of Braveheart is a huge travesty.You may think it was remiss of the Academy to shun Fargo, but it did come pretty close to winning, its chances bolstered somewhat by seven nominations and two wins (Actress for Frances McDormand and Original Screenplay for the Coen Brothers). It lost out to The English Patient.Having won Best Director five years previous for Schindler\u0027s List, Steven Spielberg was strongly expected to take home the top prizes for his Second World War epic. Cue Shakespeare In Love upsetting everybody.David Fincher\u0027s Facebook drama got shunned in favour of British patriotism in an Oscar two-horse race for the ages that ultimately saw The King\u0027s Speech crowned winner.1823 We Need to Talk About Kevin (2011)Lynne Ramsay has directed two films that would have been deserving of Best Picture: You Were Never Really Here and this, We Need to Talk About Kevin. It\u0027s easy to see why Hollywood was temporarily more charmed by The Artist, but it\u0027s clear which film will stand the test of time.It\u0027s almost unthinkable to recall that the Coen brothers\u0027 Inside Llewyn Davis only scored two Oscar nominations in the cinematography and sound mixing categories, respectively. In the ensuing years, the film has been hailed as one of the greatest of the 2010s, meaning that its no-show at the Oscars will go down as one of the Academy\u0027s biggest omissions. Still, it would have had a hard time winning over 12 Years a Slave.For the 2015 Oscars race, you were either team Birdman or team Boyhood. Richard Linklater\u0027s labour of love, shot intermittently over 12 years, ultimately failed to win. If there\u0027s any justice, Andrea Arnold will one day become an Oscar winner, but in a perfect world, she would have already won for American Honey, a drama deserving of Best Picture if there ever was one.Horror rarely gets recognised at the Oscars, but Get Out is the closest the genre had come in years. Jordan Peele may have taken home the Best Original Screenplay award, but the stars aligned for Guillermo del Toro\u0027s fantasy The Shape of Water instead.Roma was strongly expected to become the first ever foreign language film to win Best Picture. It had everything going for it, including a standout festival run and universal acclaim. But then Green Book snatched its trophy away in a late stage awards season twist that still seems too ridiculous to be true.Long revered as one of the greatest films ever made, Orson Welles\u0027 debut – a film following newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane – was just another nominee back in the day, losing out to How Green Was My Valley.

If there\u0027s any justice, Andrea Arnold will one day become an Oscar winner, but in a perfect world, she would have already won for American Honey, a drama deserving of Best Picture if there ever was one.Horror rarely gets recognised at the Oscars, but Get Out is the closest the genre had come in years. Jordan Peele may have taken home the Best Original Screenplay award, but the stars aligned for Guillermo del Toro\u0027s fantasy The Shape of Water instead.Roma was strongly expected to become the first ever foreign language film to win Best Picture. It had everything going for it, including a standout festival run and universal acclaim. But then Green Book snatched its trophy away in a late stage awards season twist that still seems too ridiculous to be true.The Oscars take place on 9 February.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The scientists hope to have a pilot factory producing the batteries within five years at the Berkeley site.The ultimate aim is to have a factory based at one of the former power stations in the South West that takes Carbon-14 isotopes directly from the graphite blocks for use in diamond batteries. This would significantly reduce the radioactivity of the remaining material, making it easier and safer to manage,” said Professor Tom Scott, director of the South West Nuclear Hub.With the majority of the UK’s nuclear power plants set to go offline in the next 10-15 years this presents a huge opportunity to recycle a large amount of material to generate power for so many great uses.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And they hope that it could shed light on where other such superluminous supernovae get their intensity from.The new breakthrough came when researchers discovered that the star gained its intense brightness when a normal supernova crashed into a shell of material that surrounded it.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

They suggested that vast amounts of iron could account for that particular line, as researchers call it – and when they tested that scenario, it worked.Scientists detect ‘unknown’ burst of gravitational waves in spaceIt became even more exciting when it quickly turned out that very large amounts of iron was needed to make the lines - at least a third of the Sun\u0027s mass - which directly ruled out some old scenarios and instead revealed a new one,\u0026nbspsaid Anders Jerkstrand from the Department of Astronomy at Stockholm University.The researchers suggest that before SN 2006gy\u0026nbspbecame what it is today, there was a double star made up of a white dwarf as big as Earth, and a huge hydrogen-rich massive star the size of our solar system. As the bigger star became even bigger, the smaller one was caught up in it and fell in towards the centre.When it got there, the white dwarf exploded into a Type Ia supernova – a normal supernova. That then collided with the envelope surrounding it, creating the giant collision that sent the light streaming across the universe.That a Type Ia supernova appears to be behind SN\u0026nbsp2006gy\u0026nbspturns upside down what most researchers have believed, says Anders\u0026nbspJerkstrand.That a white dwarf can be in close orbit with a massive hydrogen-rich star, and quickly explode upon falling to the centre, gives important new information for the theory of double star evolution and the conditions necessary for a white dwarf to explode.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The police are only contacted if the user requests help, or does not answer their phone.If it is accidentally triggered, the alert process can be stopped by entering a code.

It was the first time since August 2019 that it had registered above 50 points, which marks the line between expansion and contraction.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIHS\u0026nbspMarkit\u0027s chief business economist, Chris Williamson, said: “It seems likely that the rise kills off the prospect of an imminent rate cut by the Bank of England, with policymakers taking a wait-and-see approach as they assess the performance of the economy in the post-Brexit environment.The results of the survey, which is based on reports from managers in offices and factories, were the highest in 16 months and signalled a moderate expansion of business activity across the UK private-sector economy.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gabriella Zaghari-Ratcliffe stands next to her father Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and his mother Barbara, as they address the media in Downing Street following a meeting with Prime Minister Boris JohnsonRosa Connolly takes a close look during a preview of the Tyrannosaurs exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland, EdinburghThe sun sets behind tower cranes and the London skyline in the city financial districtPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, speaks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson as they attend the UK-Africa Investment Summit at the Intercontinental Hotel in London.

Its reading of 52.9, up from 50.0 in December, was also at a 16-month high, while the rebound in manufacturing to an eight-month high of 49.5 was not enough to tip over the line into expansion.Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg\u0026nbspBank, said that the jump in the PMI for January provides yet more evidence that UK economic activity has started to turn up sharply since the election.“Brexit progress, the promise of a big fiscal stimulus in spring, and the end of the risk that far-left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn could one day become prime minister have lifted confidence and lowered uncertainty,” he said.Market traders pared back their prediction of the likelihood of a rate cut from 70 per cent on Friday to less than 50 per cent after the release of the\u0026nbspPMI data.Simon Wells, chief European economist\u0026nbspat HSBC, said that, on balance, he believed the PMI survey would keep the Bank of England on hold at the last meeting of its monetary policy committee to be chaired by outgoing governor Mark Carney.However, he added: “Before the market races to price out any chance of rate cuts this year, it is worth keeping in mind that GDP and retail sales data were very weak, and inflation has been soft.“The PMI is still consistent with a 0.2 per cent quarterly GDP growth rate, in line with the BoE\u0027s November forecast, and still fairly sluggish. We therefore still think a rate cut could happen in May, although January now looks less likely.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This was the lowest since the aftermath of the global financial crisis in the final quarter of 2009 when it hit 9.5 per cent.The fall was driven by a sharp fall in profits in the North Sea oil and gas, that slimmed to 1.3 per cent from 2.3 per cent as the prices of both fuels fell in the third quarter.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, the drop in profits was witnessed across business with services firms suffering a 0.4 points fall to 15.2 per cent and manufacturers down by a steeper 0.9 points to 11.1 per cent.Earlier this week figures showed the number of firms issuing profits warnings hit a four-year high in the final quarter of last year, according to business advisers EY.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gabriella Zaghari-Ratcliffe stands next to her father Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and his mother Barbara, as they address the media in Downing Street following a meeting with Prime Minister Boris JohnsonRosa Connolly takes a close look during a preview of the Tyrannosaurs exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland, EdinburghThe sun sets behind tower cranes and the London skyline in the city financial districtPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, speaks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson as they attend the UK-Africa Investment Summit at the Intercontinental Hotel in London.

Djifanghor, 27, is a single mother who lives alone in the village of Niaguis with her mother. After her father died in 2008 her eldest brother was forced to work away to protect the family income. Belange, 23, lives in the village of Soutoure, near Kolda. Her parents have always traditionally farmed rice \u0026amp peanut crops but have noticed the rainy season is unstable – sometimes there is more rain and sometimes there is not enough. Elie, 27, along with her family fled Oussouye in the Ziguinchor Region of Senegal in 1998 at the height of the conflict. She recalls stories of how the rebel groups lit fuel around shelters and make-shift homes and those residents who tried to escape were shot. “I still hear the crying and screams of those who perished … that is still what I have in my mind”. Dry inlet at Mandina village near Sedhiou. In recent years water reserves where Cattle used to graze the lush grass at the bank has dropped significantly. All that remains are the discarded nets from a once active fishing area for locals, now a vast area of cracked mud and salt crystals.Khady, 32, lives 4km from Ziguinchor. She participated in both the Agricultural Training camp in December 2018 and spent 3 months at the Incubation camp where she learnt how to transform her crops.A dry inlet bed at Mandina near Sedhiou, where cattle once grazed the lush vegetation on the banks – now all that remains are their footprints and hoof marksAlima, 31, says her ancestors have always been farmers: “My mother, my grandmother and my great grandmother all were, but they farmed very differently. They would grow rice, maize and millet only, whereas we are choosing what is easier for us to grow. We can now make more profit than in the past.” Cezi, 29, lives in Carounate, near Ziguinchor. Her father was killed in 1995 during the conflict when she was just 4 years old. “A lot of people were killed on the same day in my area, houses were destroyed and several families were forced to move away. “My schooling was affected – I felt ashamed when the others talked about their fathers and I didn’t have one. It all affected my studies.” She explains how hard the period was for her family, in particular her mother. “She used to drink alcohol as she said it was the only way to forget the ‘bad souvenirs’ (memories) from that day.” Cezi is one of 11 family members at home.The Ampa Awagna project since its introduction in 2017 has trained 354 students in agricultural techniques and empowered 90 participants with the knowledge and skill to start their own companies. Projects like these are monumental in a region where 72 per cent of young people live on less than £1.50 per day. Famatou, 32, lives in the village of Saleykegna. She has struggled in the past to provide enough food for her family to eat. She explained how she had heard the Ampa Awagna project was providing small scale farmers with improved techniques growing crops to increase yields. Since her training, her onions have doubled in size and she has the ability to earn well and provide for her five children. “I get one production and I can earn 35,000 CFA (£54). I’m very happy now that my vegetable garden is doing better. I hope it will continue to be successful, otherwise, this will affect my family, I just love to see my garden grow.”Aida, 36, lives in Takou village, near Sedhiou. She has five children and is 8 months pregnant but still works tirelessly on her small holding and with her chickens. The family only eat twice a day but Aida has a business plan to grow her poultry farm. “My mother used to grow rice and peanuts just for food. People still do grow these here but only in the rainy season, which is very short. Lydie, 25, lives in Boukitingho near Ziguinchor. She attended the Ampa Awagna Y CareYMCA course and learned how to upscale the vegetables she grows by turning produce from the market into syrup, juice and marmalade. This enables her to earn a more consistent income the whole year-round. She is already teaching other women in the village the new skills she learned at the course. “We have a joint piece of land in the village where we can grow our crops, and there we grow carrots, salad, onions and maize.Y Care International, the YMCA’s aid and development charity, is empowering young women across the world and is supporting a programme in Senegal to address youth unemployment and help the next generation of farmers adapt to climate change. Beneficiaries like Fatou are able to create sustainable lives for themselves and their families.Bouya, 23, lives in a village on the outskirts of Kolda. An orphan, she lost both her parents to illness. Until now Bouya has been totally dependent on her uncle for support. “I’ve just completed the agricultural training camp at Ampa Awagna and I am now planning to develop my own smallholding. The plot of land belonged to my father.  My idea is to start growing okra, lettuce, tomato and cucumber – okra is a great crop because it is resistant to the heat.Laurentine, 26, runs a smallholding of pigs near Kolda. She is using the new farming methods she learnt on the Ampa Awangna camp and is extremely positive about the future. “Before the training, we used traditional methods. The programme taught me the modern way is to keep them in the shelter as when they wander around they can bring back diseases”. She now has 40 pigs and hopes in the next 10 years to move to a much larger holding where she wants 200-300 pigs.Belange, 23, lives in the village of Soutoure, near Kolda. Having excelled at the initial 2-week agricultural training camp at Ampa Awagna, Belange was asked to complete the 50-day intensive agricultural camp. She explained: “When I returned, I started growing in my vegetable garden, rearing pigs and poultry. I am earning much more than I did before the training. I’m growing tomatoes, peppers and chillis and I have much more output. Our life is better now – we don’t need to get help from others or have to ask people for money.”Khady, 32, watering her crops of Aubergine and Ochre near Ziguinchor. Watering the crops to ensure they produce the best yields takes several hours a day.A beneficiary of the Y CareYMCA Ampa Awagna, Belange, 23 stands marking the spot, where the rice harvest should have reached. The deficit in rice crop yields (the staple diet) reported by several farmers or total crop-losses due to inconsistent rainfall have pushed vulnerable households with depleted food stocks to begin using negative coping strategies such as decreasing the number of meals per day for the family. Alphonse George Manga, regional executive secretary for YMCA Senegal, explained: “We are in a changing world, we can’t stay in the past. For this century things are changing for the better for women. I think in the future there will be a role reversal. Where previously, women were required to stay at home, they are now far more skilled and empowered. They can do and be whatever they want if they are just given a chance and a little bit of help.”Fatou, 30, comes from a family of farmers approximately 20km away from the village of Bousra where she now lives with her son Ibu.

They can do and be whatever they want if they are just given a chance and a little bit of help.”According to estimates from UN agencies, the conflict in Casamance, Senegal, claimed the lives of over 5,000 people. The Movement of Democratic Forces in Casamance (MFDC) emerged in 1982 as an armed separatist group advocating for independence, creating a guerilla force who began attacks on the Senegalese army in 1990.In lower Casamance, 78 villages were completely destroyed, creating\u0026nbspover 60,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) and subjected them to a life of fewer opportunities. Tens of thousands also crossed borders seeking refuge in Guinea-Bissau and the Gambia.Although an eventual ceasefire was implemented in 2014, today few MFDC combatants remain and violent incidents are in decline. The fear of sporadic attacks has now been replaced by far greater fears of youth unemployment and food insecurities driven by the changing climate.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHigh levels of poverty and hunger persist in Senegal despite solid economic growth in recent years. Chronic malnutrition affects\u0026nbspapproximately 17 per cent of children younger than 5 years of age, according to the UN World Food Program.Countries in the Sahel who rely on agriculture as primary sources of food and income are most at risk of crises and disasters. Unpredictable weather patterns, frequent droughts, floods and land desalinisation threaten the livelihoods of vulnerable communities.In Dakar, street artists from all over the world make their markThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated: “A number of countries in Africa who already face semi-arid conditions may see a reduction in projected crop yield by up to 50 per cent\u0026nbspin 2020 and reduced revenues by as much as 90 per cent by 2100.”However, a new generation of small scale farming has emerged from women in the region. They are defying\u0026nbspwhat predominantly male farming practices\u0026nbsphave done for generations and are adapting to the climate changes.Most Senegalese\u0026nbsphave noticed changes in the weather and seasons – they talk of drought, increases in temperature and distinctly shorter rainy seasons but most do not draw the connection with global climate change.Y Care International, the YMCA’s aid and development charity, is empowering young women across the world and is supporting a programme in Senegal to address youth unemployment and help the next generation of farmers adapt to the climate crisis.Leigh Daynes, CEO for Y Care International, explains:\u0026nbsp“The high unemployment and poverty levels experienced by young people in this remote and rural area of Casamance have only been further exacerbated by climate change. Families are now really struggling to cope with the shortfall of crops and having enough food to eat.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You erased a continent.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnd in a video statement, the 23-year-old added that, for the first time in her life, she now “understood the definition of the word racism”.The cropped image was made available to news outlets across the world after being taken by the Associated Press news agency following a press call in the Swiss town.It said it had removed Ms Nakate only to improve the picture’s composition and it had not acted with “ill intent”.David Ake, director of photography, said: “The photographer was trying to get a picture out fast under a tight deadline and cropped it purely on composition grounds because he thought the building in the background was distracting.“When we went back to add more pictures to the report, which we almost always do when we are working under very tight deadlines, we added additional pictures with different crops.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester holds a sign reading On the move mocking the LREM party\u0027s slogan during a demonstration in Paris, as part as a nationwide multi-sector strike against the French government\u0027s pensions overhaulA Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

The varied landscapes and lives of residents wedged in these borderlands speak of two different systems that have coexisted on one another’s doorstep.Far from the marches and salvos of tear gas and petrol bombs over the past half-year of anti-government protests that have convulsed Hong Kong, the residents in this border realm have borne witness to both rapid urbanisation, as China booms, and the preservation of a slower pace of life.About 20 miles\u0026nbsplong, this boundary meanders between fish ponds, farmland, sleepy traditional villages and grassy hills on the Hong Kong side, with the gleaming skyscrapers of China’s high-tech city of Shenzhen on the other. Shenzhen, once itself the bucolic backwater, has risen into China’s giddy vision of a digital, high-tech future.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHong Kong is world’s most visited city in 2019We may have won the elections battle, but the war is ongoingHong Kong police ‘hack into more than 3,700 mobile phones’Mr\u0026nbspLam, now in his eighties, lives in a house without mobile phone reception, where he farms and catches crabs. A narrow sliver of water separates him from mainland China. He recalls living in a wooden cabin along the Shenzhen River\u0026nbspwith his family 70 years ago. There were only “old and broken” sheds on the far shore back then, he says, gazing into the distance. “Of course, the mainland is much more advanced than before. Everything is good, even the streets are beautiful.”Over past decades of political upheaval in communist China, waves of mainlanders flooded across the border into Hong Kong, seeking peace and a better life. Lam still remembers the flashlights of the British-run police piercing the dark as they chased illegal immigrants making a dash for freedom.Andrew Kwok, an old fish farmer living in the area, recalls those who drowned making the perilous crossing. “There were a lot of them, hundreds of dead bodies in the river,” he says.The flickering, lonely torches have now been replaced by a vibrant mega-city with a million flashing lights. The living quality for people on both sides may have converged, but a gulf remains. For these two peoples, it remains a struggle to reconcile shifting eras, values and dreams.Merrin Ke, 23, grew up in Shenzhen but got her masters degree from Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University. She had flitted easily between both sides, up until recently, when she moved to Shanghai. “I think the situation in Hong Kong is quite sensitive now, which is easy for people to have conflicts due to different political stands,” she says. “That’s why I’ve decided to leave Hong Kong to work and get away from the intense environment.”Even though the protests in Hong Kong show no sign of abating, Ke remains optimistic unity will overcome ision. She says: “Hong Kong people used to come to have fun in Shenzhen and people from mainland China also liked to visit Hong Kong. But now such things are becoming less and less. I still hope everyone can put differences aside, and it’s not enough for just one side to do this. It requires the joint efforts of both sides.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailAnd even if they were illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, or third, fourth generation migrants, neither the municipal authorities nor the local police has the jurisdiction to act in the way it did - that would be a matter for the federal authorities.Ms Adavi said the incident was particularly concerning because it came just days after the local BJP legislative assembly member (MLA) for the area, Aravind Limbavali, tweeted a video of the settlement, saying it was “without cleanliness… a site of illegal activity” and housing people who “are suspect to be illegal immigrants of Bangladesh”.Such comments do not exist in isolation. Only two days after the demolition, the BJP’s most senior official in West Bengal state, Dilip Ghosh, said there were “two crore (20 million) Bangladeshi Muslim infiltrators” who had entered India, adding that “we will not allow any to stay here”.Ms Adavi said there was clearly a link between the evictions in Bengaluru and a broader anti-immigrant “sense across India right now”, with the government recently passing a citizenship law for refugees that excludes Muslims, and the exercise of creating a register of legal citizens (NRC) in Assam state.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester holds a sign reading On the move mocking the LREM party\u0027s slogan during a demonstration in Paris, as part as a nationwide multi-sector strike against the French government\u0027s pensions overhaulA Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

November 2010Mr Dolgopolov said there was no point trying to argue his case in Russia’s court system.“The judges pass the decisions they are told to pass,” he said.\u0026nbspThe Russian Interior Ministry has since confirmed police have opened an investigation into a possible crime under Russia’s anti-blasphemy laws.Behind Mr Dolgopolov’s fears is a very sobering reality: over the past decade, the Kremlin has introduced a series of broad-brushed laws that criminalise “extremism” and the “abuse of feelings of religious believers”. The measures are largely arbitrary and have been used to clamp down on dissent and inconvenient voices.\u0026nbspPussy Riot member Maria Alyokhina leaves Russia despite ban on leaving“The threat of criminal prosecution in Mr Dolgopolov’s case is very real,” said Samir Gainutdinov, a lawyer working for the Agora advocacy group. “Just mentioning Jesus in the same sentence as profanity could serve as a pretext to a charge.”\u0026nbspIt is not clear\u0026nbspexactly which part of Mr Dolgopolov’s routine provoked the complaint.\u0026nbspBaza, a publication\u0026nbspconsidered close to Russian law enforcement, blamed\u0026nbspprofane jokes involving Jesus and the Virgin Mary.\u0026nbspIn the recording of his February stand-up performance, Mr Dolgopolov\u0026nbspcertainly does mix themes of\u0026nbspGod,\u0026nbspatheism and profanity\u0026nbsp– often hilariously. But President Putin, his political system and his supporters also come in for particular ribbing. In one section, the comedian\u0026nbspsuggests Russians would walk into molten lava in their masses if “the wise leader” Putin told them.\u0026nbsp“As far as I know it was because of the religious jokes, but I don’t exclude there being another reason,” Mr Dolgopolov\u0026nbspsuggested.\u0026nbsp‘Gift for satire’: Russian humourist on law banning criticism of stateThe comedian said he was always conscious of the fact his routine touched on taboo subjects. Indirectly, authorities even made their feelings about him known – in one case, police called a venue to warn them “not to joke about Putin like that” after he had performed there. But\u0026nbspMr Dolgopolov also believed his relative obscurity was insurance against the authorities taking a more active interest.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I didn’t really understand what the job was then.While the rules are dferent in every US state, typically in Wisconsin funeral directors have to pass an associates degree followed by an apprenticeship and internship to become licenced.For Jordan, the apprenticeship involved a lot of time at the back of the mortuary, learning the art of embalming.But while shes grown used to the tough job, some cases have proved particularly hard to remain detached from.She says: “If theyve shot themselves in the head, weve had to deal with that. One week here we had two -year-old suicides in one week. That was a terrible week.“Seeing those young boys and then seeing one of their families. It was devastating. It’s harder when you identy with people. They’re the same age as my cousin.“And especially when people are my age, you think, ‘That’s my age, they’re , that’s me’. Orthey look like your grandparents or they’re your parents’ age. Little things like that will get you.”However, she insists: I absolutely love my job. I love meeting with families and being there for them. I love being the first person to reassure them.Meanwhile, theres long been myths and rumours on whether a body can move or make a noise after death.According to Jordan, it is in fact true- and shes seen it first hand.She says: “While I’ve never had a body move, sometimes their hand may fallits been held up when they died. It can make you jump, especially when it hits you.“The scariest thing is when you’re first transferring the body to the cot. It’s called the death rattle. When you pick them up their lungs squeeze a bit of air, it makes a gurgling sound. It’s hard.“I do everything in my power not to yell or put my hands up.And while this job might not be for everyone, I love being the first person to reassure families that everything’s going to be okay.Noah Watry, , is a licenced funeral director from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Noah pledged to bring his creativity to the job when he first started training, and hes stayed true to his word.From hunting down bands for funeral ceremonies, to organising a taco truck for one family to honour their loved ones passion for food, he tries to ensure they all have a very modern and memorable goodbye.A typical day for Noah can begin in the early hours of the morning,hes the on-call director, with some nights seeing him collecting up to six bodies single-handedly.Sadly, some deaths have impacted Noah more than others.He says: “There are a few I’ll never forget. My first child I’ll never forget because she looked exactly like my niece.“I remember she was the same age and looked exactly like her. I remember calling my sister straight after. It was a car accident, she was eight years old.While many deaths can be peaceful, others require a great deal of skill to ensure the deceaseds family can see them looking like themselves before they say goodbye.Noah says: “I’ve had bad suicides, where they’ve shot themselves and I’ve had to put their face back together. It’s almost like plastic surgery sometimes.“There would be a lot of suturing back up. There will be re-forming of the face. We ask the families for photos of them, taken from dferent anglesthey have them, to recreate their face.“There’s dferent materials we use. Sometimes you have to use clay, sometimes you have to use putties. Then you’re able to use cosmetics and cover that up, to form the face exactly how it needs to be. It definitely takes some time.While Noah has been in the industry for several years now, he still struggles with old stereotypes of funeral directors - and its even previously impacted his love le.He says: “Sometimes people look at you like you’re an old creepy person!I once went on a date with a girl and when she found out what I did, she was like, ‘Oh my gosh, how do you expect to find someone to marry then ’ I was like, ‘Wow I guess that’s not going to be you then!’”Mum Evie Vargas, , from Chicago works for Frigid Fluid, a company that creates embalming fluids. She recently left her job as a funeral director.She says of her time as a director: “You’re ultimately doing a really great thing for a family because you’re preparing their loved one for that final goodbye.In some cases emotions can run high and Evie admits shes been at the receiving end of some very angry outbursts from family members before.She says: “It’s something you have to deal with. You have to understand they’re not mad at you, they’re mad at the situation. You have to brush it off.“When I first started I would take it personally. It took me a while to realise they’re not mad at me and I did the best that I could.”As a younger person in the industry, Evie is now keen to embrace new trends.She says: “I think people are more in charge of their deaths than ever. People have dferent ideas, like green burials. People don’t want to be embalmed and want toback to the Earth naturally.”Brian Waters, , is married with two kids. He works for two small family funeral homes in Indiana, having grown up with his parents in the industry.While Brian admits he found his parents jobs odd and often scary when he was a child, it soon became normal and began to interest him more in his teenage years.However, being from a small area also means hes seen people he knows pass away too.He says: More often than not [its people I know]. It is a lot harder when there’s a personal connection.For Brian, some of the worst memories he has are following a sudden or unexpected death.He says: “Sudden tragic loss is awful, when you hear those guttural screams of grief. Those sounds never leave your head. They’re always bouncing around in there. It’s hair raising, it gives you goosepimples.“That often happensit’s a child of any age.”Tragically, Brians job was made much harder in  when he and his we sadly lost a baby of their own.He now admits the tragedy gave him a new perspective on the job.Brian runs his own podcast on the funeral industry, in an effort to lt the stigma around how much ceremonies cost to organise. He insists, unlike many may believe, most funeral homes are barely getting by.He says: “I think people think because we dress up, we wear a suit and the cars are clean, that there’s money falling out our ears. It’s a really tight ship for most funeral homes these days.“We can work anything from  to  hours a week. There’s many sleepless nights, your brain starts to slow down, but that’s small town family business.”Ingrid Johansen, , works part-time at a local funeral home cemetery in El Cerrito, Calornia.Ingrid currently goes to college in Sacramento, while working part-time - mainly helping out in the embalming room as well as front of house.For Ingrid however, the hardest part of the job is seeing people her own age come through the doors - especially following a violent or gruesome death.Ingrid now hopes to push for new traditions and transparency in what she does, and one way is through death cafes.These are set up across the world for people to go and chat to others openly about death, should they be worried about opening up to their family.She says: With Death Cafes, I’d love to see the eventual expansion into schools , and for more expansion into cities small towns as well.While their jobs prove emotionally draining at times however, all these brave morticians agree that, above all , theyre happy and proud to be helping families at their most dficult time.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Prince Charles will see to that.Harry will continue to receive £million from his father, but although Charles has amassed a personal fortune of over £million, the money might not be coming from that closely guarded pot.The prince could instead be paying him through a outdated racket called the Duchy of Cornwall.Charles could claim this as a business expense which means he can reduce the amount of tax he pays. The public would be paying for Harry by the back door.Harry of course has no connection with this sprawling property company called the Duchy, but that has never stopped Charles benefiting from its special tax status.The status of the Duchy has been contested for decades and while Charles insists it is private, thats strongly disputed by others.Charles has also claimed as business expenses the cost of  personal staff to pamper him – butlers, valets, gardeners.He had the cheek to argue that Camilla’s personal costs even before they married were a Duchy expense so claimed for her staff, her travel, her jewellery, and the stabling of her horses.And he got away with it. The line was only drawn when he tried to claim his polo ponies as business expenses.In my time in Parliament I saw plenty of MPs claiming for duck houses, moat cleaning and the like. Is this dferent So what is this Duchy  Well it’s not just in Cornwall where it has land. Its tentacles stretch far and wide. It even owns the Oval cricket ground. Extra cover for the Prince as he hits the taxpayer for six.The Duchy turns in a profit of over £million a year. That is money that many argue should go straight to the Treasury. Instead it becomes pocket money for the Prince.He has reluctantly agreed he should pay tax on this money but the vast array of creative expenses he conjures up means in a recent year when the Duchy made £.million, only £.million was paid in tax at  per cent.That can only be explainedhe dreamed up more than £million in expenses.Charles says the Duchy is a “private estate” — which it is legally, but it acts like a public body that reverts to the Crown when theres no Duke of Cornwall.It has had notices served on it by the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency and they can only be served on a public body.It is the harbour authority for the Isles of Scilly. The Information Commissioner has ruled it is public.But by insisting it is private means the Duchy’s accounting practices can be hidden away. No right of access for the National Audit Office. No freedom of information.If you go cap in hand and bow and scrape, they might let you see some old Duchy paperwork. On the other hand, they might not.In this medieval throwback, Charles scoops up the property of anybody who dies without leaving a will. The general right for a King or Queen to do this was abolished in . But not in the Duchy.Yet this so-called private estate suddenly becomes public when it suits Charles. Unlike any other private estate in Britain, it doesn’t pay any corporation tax or capital gains tax.No wonder Charles is worth over £million.Suddenly the private Prince becomes a public figure, demanding – and getting – the right to change government legislation that affects the Duchy in a way he doesn’t like.To be fair, he does pay the market rent for the vast property he occupies at Highgrove. He pays it to the Duchy which then s the money to him, tax-free, as the Duke of Cornwall in a sort of merry money-go-round.He got Duchy employees to grow trees on Duchy land and then sold the timber to... The Duchy. Charles pocketed £.million tax free for this racket.The Duchy of Cornwall is not some hobby growing a bit of organic lettuce here and there. Nor is it a small collection of twee cottages as you might infer from the pictures the Duchy uses in its publications.No, it is a hard-headed ruthless property company with advantages in tax and law that no other company has.It is a massive money-making machine for Prince Charles, money that rightly belongs to us all but that he erts to himself.It’s time for this medieval monstrosity to be sorted out.

Which they are on ­commercial rivals like Nick Ferrari on LBC or Julia Hartley-Brewer on TalkRADIO.At least those stations don’t start from a position of: “Brexit is evil and a majority Tory government isn’t much ­better.”No one is proposing for a single second the BBC be axed. But the poll tax that funds it should be.Its websites that write clickbait about TV shows like Love Island — well ­covered by other online outlets — should be stopped too. Not to mention its recent push into the already saturated podcast market.The BBC’s job is not to be a monolith, shutting out commercial organisations and dominating the entertainment and news industries.That’s what makes yesterday’s decision to axe Victoria Derbyshire’s BBC programme ridiculous.Her award-winning morning show is one of the only news programmes on the ­corporation to properly cover the working class.It is unbiased, feisty, fair and will cover entertainment stories or whatever happens to be the splash of The Sun that day, without the snobbery of the rest of BBC News.That sort of non-commercial show is just the type the Beeb should be making. But — of course — under its latest cuts, it is the first to go.The next Director-General must be an outsider who understands the madness of the BBC’s current priorities and is ­prepared to enact real change.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And climate change, whether the prince wants to acknowledge it or not, is an innately political issue.Two of the world’s biggest players – the US and China – are nowhere close to where we are on the so-called crisis.It’s up to Boris Johnson to criticise them and for Charles to calm them down with ceremonial State visits.Sure, Charles should be offering his support and sympathy to the people of Australia impacted by bushfires, for example.Perhaps he could even visit the area and talk about the damage.But offering a ten-point solution politicians should enact is insane – especially given he flew to Davos on a £, private jet trip that emitted six tonnes of carbon.If the hypocritical prince is so impetuous that he can’t see the time has come for his role to change, I genuinely fear for the Royal Family.The last thing the country needs is another two-bit political wannabe trying to gain popularity on the back of Greta.What we desperately need is a future king who can bring us together beyond politics and beyond the embarrassing PR mess engulfing his family.CHRIS MARTIN swore at fans this week who were trying to get his autograph following a Coldplay gig in LA.Shocking, isn’t it  Who asks for an autograph these days How vintage. ORLANDO BLOOM will voice Prince Harry in a comedy cartoon called The Prince for US broadcaster HBO, which is set to poke fun at our calamitous royals.I hope the actor has put in the hours perfecting how to whinge relentlessly. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

providing no other complaints are lodged.The doctors sudden denial comes after he confirmed to both The Sun Online and trade site World Trademark Review that he was behind the objection notice.Hours later, his family also flip-flopped over whether he was involved.His brother Ammiel, of Salford, Manchester eventually claimed it must be a mix up.Speaking from his doorstep, the told The Sun Online: Ive been in touch with my brother and he insists its not him.Dr Worcester worked as a doctor in the NHS in London from  to  and studied medicine at University College London before moving to Australia.According to the General Medical Council register, Dr Worcester is currently registered in the UK without a licence to practise.However, he registered with the Australian Medical Council in  after moving overseas with his family.The formal ‘notice of threatened opposition was filed to the UK Government’s IPO on Tuesday and could have meant Harry and Meghan would have to shell out in lawyers fees and other costs to get the right to use the name in the UK.But the trademark application can continue to go ahead after the objection notice was rescinded.The Queen has yet to decide whether they can still use the “royal” part of their name - which could be worth billions.After registering a trademark, there is a period of ‘opposition’, when anyone against its use is first allowed to make this known and has the effect of extending the time before the trademark can be used.It gives opponents the time to mount a case against its use, although they may decide not to object.The period of opposition for Harry and Meghan’s application was due to end on February , but that period is now extended until at least March .June : The couple file for the Sussex Royal brand with the Intellectual Property OfficeJanuary  : Meghan and Harry reveal they intend to step back as senior royals and become financially independentJanuary : The Queen allows the couple to step back, and they agree to pay back the £.m of taxpayer money spent on Frogmore CottageJanuary : A notice of threatened opposition is filed against the Sussex Royal trademarkJanuary : The Intellectual Property Office confirmed the notice was being rescinded Lee Curtis, a chartered trademark attorney and partner at specialist law firm HGF, said: “Filing a notice of threatened opposition is relatively easy and can be done online for free.“The filing of a formal notice of opposition is much more involved.“Right now, the threatened opposition delays the progress of the Sussex Royal application by at least one month, buta formal opposition is ultimately mounted, this will involve the payment of an opposition fee, the drafting of formal grounds of opposition and the filing of evidence and legal submissions in support of the opposition.“The whole opposition could take at least a year to get to a decision and is thus not an action entered into lightly with a possible costs award against the losing party.”Meghan and Harry were previously reported to have trademarked  items including pencils and socks six months ago in their bid to become financially independent.The couple agreed to drop their HRH titles and pay back the £.million spent on renovating their Frogmore Cottage home as part of the deal to quit the Royal Family. Experts predicted they could rake in millions in commercial deals while still pocketing £million a year from Prince Charles.However Charles has urged Prince Harry and Meghan Markle not to profit from their Royal titles with strict rules expected on branding.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His we has been given the status of victim by the court.Her lawyer Ruslan Dzhanabaev told EASTWEST News: “During the incident she was not in the room.“The couple quarrelled and she ran out into the corridor. She does not know whether Mohamed intentionally harmed the child or not.“We are waiting for the results of the examination.”The lawyer said: “Madina is in contact with Mohamed and she has no desire to jail him at any price.”But he said: “We do not want to push the investigation. We respect our court and believe in its forensic analysis.”He added: “For unknown reasons, the investigation is denying her a meeting with her husband.“He is now in pre-trial detention and Madina is his only family member in this country.”Witnesses said that the we was crying loudly when she ran to the hotel lobby at around am on  October .She was in floods of tears and begging for help, a hotel staff member said.He was living in Hong Kong and on a family visit to Kazakhstan when he was detained on suspicion of murder.The highly experience pilot worked previously for airlines VietJet Air, Scoot, and AirAsia.The Foreign Office said: We are in contact with the police in Kazakhstan following the death of a British child and the arrest of a British man in Almaty.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The project is already massively over budget, it may well break the £billion mark soon, and running a decade late.A row about what to do about it is brewing in the Tory party.“HS is building up to be quite a serious disagreement within the party,” says one leading backbencher.Birmingham Tories are keen to save the scheme, believing it to be key to the re-election prospects of their West Midlands Mayor Andy Street.One argument they are deploying is that going ahead with HS would make it easier for the Government to scrap the third runway at Heathrow.They point out that when David Cameron backed the scheme while the Tories were in opposition, it was, in part, as an alternative to Heathrow expansion.Given that Boris Johnson has said he would lie down in front of the bulldozers before he allowed a third runway to be built, it would be extremely embarrassing for himthe project proceeded.But for a Prime Minister, who boasts of his commitment to infrastructure, to scrap two of the biggest transport projects in the country would be politically dficult. This might well be what saves HS, in some form.This Government knows what it wants to do.But the real challenge is actually delivering on this agenda, of ensuring that, when Boris Johnson pulls the levers, something happens.I UNDERSTAND that Boris Johnson is keen to amalgamate the Department for International Development and the Foreign Office this year.His experience as Foreign Secretary has left him convinced that you need to align the two departments.The UK will, though, remain committed to spending . per cent of national income on foreign aid.In preparation for this beefed-up role for the Foreign Office, I’m told Rob Oxley – the Prime Minister’s Press Secretary – is heading there to work for Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary.Oxley was with Boris and Dominic Cummings on the Vote Leave campaign before working with them in Downing Street.He is a trusted member of their team and his presence in the Foreign Office will ensure smooth relations between Downing Street and the FCO.He is also across the international issues, having previously been a special adviser at both the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development.KEIR STARMER is out in front in the Labour leadership race.He has four times as many nominations from constituency Labour parties as any other candidate. Right now, this race is his to lose.If Starmer does win, it will consolidate a change in British politics. He will find it easier to squeeze Liberal Democrat voters in the south than to win back those Leave voters Labour have lost in the Midlands and the North in recent years. Labour’s sht to being a party of urban graduates will continue under him.The problem for Labour is that this approach simply will not win them enough seats to govern.In a generation’s time, it may well work. But not now. Starmer’s supporters argue that he comes without Jeremy Corbyn’s baggage and that many of the voters Labour lost at the last election will come back to the party as soon as they are offered a credible leader. This, though, seems an optimistic reading of events.One supporter of another candidate claims that the sense Starmer “looks the part” and “you can imagine him as PM” is just because he is a man. “Never underestimate the sexism of the Labour party,” she complains.NIGEL FARAGE will vote for the withdrawal agreement when it comes before the European Parliament next week. Farage had previously been a trenchant critic of the deal.He has described it as “awful”, “ per cent the same as Mrs May’s deal” and “a Remainer’s Brexit”. But he’s been convinced by the Government’s statements about how it doesn’t intend to be a rule-taker after Brexit.For this reason – and because it would look absurd for him to vote against Brexit – he will now back the deal. Farage plans to leave UK politics on January . But he intends to keep a watching brief, saying he is prepared toto the frayBoris Johnson’s government pulls back from its current position.Farage’s experience with the Brexit Party, which went from launch to topping the poll in the European elections in a matter of weeks, has persuaded him that new political parties can have an instant impact when required.THE row over a potential peerage for John Bercow is not going to go away. He is claiming he is entitled to one.But the Government is keen to stop the former Speaker getting one given how he twisted parliamentary procedure to aid those MPs who were trying to block Boris Johnson on Brexit.Meanwhile, the former chief clerk of the House of Commons, Lord Lisvane, has made a formal complaint alleging that Bercow bullied staff.One MP who Bercow appointed to the  of chairs tells me the most likely outcome to the row is that the House of Lords Appointments Commission does not accept Jeremy Corbyn’s nomination of Bercow.But rather than rejecting it outright, it will say “not now” and insist that all proceedings relating to Bercow’s alleged bullying are dealt with before a decision is made on whether he can go to the Lords or not.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Simple as.Yes, the track is vulnerable. In  it was destroyed by a storm and, while it was being repaired, Cornwall was effectively cut off from the rest of the country.But this bit of track, designed and built by Brunel, is extremely pretty and charming and that, in the coming years, is going to matter more than a few Corns being cut off for a week or two.As we leave Europe, we have in our minds that we will be a modern, dynamic nation with magnetic levitation transportation systems linking all the towns and villages. We see glass towers piercing the clouds in Rochdale and space ports in Basingstoke.Ain’t going to happen.If we decide that everything old-fashioned and historical must go to make le more modern, then we can wave goodbye to the Tower of London, because that piece of real estate should obviously be sold to commercial developers.They say the submersibles these people use are causing “untold damage” to the ship.Hmm.

They love our changing of the guard, and our castles and our awkward Elizabethan houses.

Then the judges go home to listen to The Beatles and The Who.We need to capitalise on that. We need the red telephone boxes back. We need warty peasants on every street corner and lots of men tipping their bowler hats when they see a lady.Because then, tourists will be queuing round the block to give us their dollars and their dongs.And we can start by leaving that pretty bit of railway line in Devon alone.Yes, it’ll mean that from time to time Cornwall will be cut off.

Then they heard a house master coming down the corridor and everyone rushed to get back into bed.They dropped the boy tied to the chair and he crashed to the ground below and broke his back. We never saw him again.”Nights were “absolutely fearsome”, when the lights went out and the dormitory monitor was in charge.Tom, who now lives in Plymouth and has written his le story, The Last Foundling, said: “We knew that before he went to sleep he’d want to have his bit of fun.”One day, while waiting outside the headmaster’s office aged , he overheard a staff member say his mother’s name and where she lived.He secretly kept the information to himself during his ten years in the institution and five years spent with a foster family and their daughters, Monica and Janet. After another five years in the Army, Tom finally tracked down his mother, who by that time was married to a solicitor and worked as a legal secretary in Edinburgh.He said: “I wanted to make it a surprise. I went into the lobby and the receptionist rang up to Jean.“I couldn’t face her as she came down the stairs, so I had my back to her and heard footsteps. My heart was racing and I thought, ‘What am I going to say ’“She came up behind me and I turned around, and she said, ‘Can I help you ’ I said, ‘I don’t know’, and she said, ‘Do I know you ’I said, ‘Perhaps in another world’.” After an emotional reunion the pair exchanged letters. Then Jean invited Tom to live with her and her husband, Duncan Mackenzie.And in another twist of fate, decades later, after Duncan died, Jean resumed her relationship with Tom’s real father, Raymond.More than  years after they were wrenched apart, Tom’s family was finally reunited.But most of the , children cared for by the Foundling Hospital were not so lucky, with just one per cent being claimed by their families.Of the rest, boys were prepared for careers in the Army or Navy, and girls trained for domestic service, all of them turned out to fend for themselves in their early teens.Education was not a priority, as former foundling John Caldicott remembers. Now , he lived at the hospital from  to .He said: “We were brought up aswe were in the Georgian era, wearing unorms and marching everywhere.“We were children of our time. The discipline would not be accepted today. Boys were separated from girls and it was a monastic style of le.”After leaving the hospital at , John was apprenticed to a radio and music shop in Oxford and went on to work for Oxfordshire County Council.When the hospital opened in the Georgian era, apprenticeships were an informal model of adoption, with an employer taking over a child’s care and putting them to work in exchange for food and lodgings.The Foundling Hospital model was deemed so successful that similar institutions were set up in New York, Paris and around the world.In Britain, that all changed with the  Children Act, which recommended that children should be taken back by their birth mothers or found homes with foster parents.After the hospital’s closure in  it became Ashlyns School, which still contains stained-glass windows, a staircase and monuments from the original London hospital.The Coram children’s charity continues the Foundling Hospital’s work to this day, as one of Britain’s largest independent adoption agencies.And as for the thousands of children who passed through the hospital’s doors, their history will be digitised in a new project that will make pre- records available for the first time.Thanks to a £.million National Lottery Heritage Fund grant, history buffs will be able to view petition letters from mothers seeking hospital places for their children, as well as the heartbreaking tokens they left with them.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Today, the prince had the courage to speak up for the plight of the Palestinians while on a visit to Jerusalem. As he rightly reminded his audience, a just and lasting peace in the Middle East can only be found through a two-state solution. These words carry all the more weight coming from someone who has long championed dialogue between dferent faiths. And it must surely be noted that on both the issue of climate change and the Middle East peace process he has placed himself on the opposite side to Donald Trump.  On both these subjects he spoke with authority and genuine compassion. Our future king has never been shy of expressing his views. But in the last few days he has started to find his true voice and shown the crucial role he can play. Filling the gap There should be no need for private police ... or a private health service.

Married Ruthin School teacher Toby Belfield, , is alleged to have texted schoolgirls, calling them aposnaughtyapos and asking one about pictures of her in a red dress, according to messages obtained by the Times. He is also said to have referenced breasts, virginity and sexuality, North Wales Live reports. The messages believed to have been sent by the principal at the £,-a-year school also apparently suggested he would visit the girls at university and asked one of them where her aposlove for your principalapos had gone. Mr Belfield had previously been dubbed Britainaposs strictest head teacher after he hit the headlines for threatening them with expulsionthey formed romantic relationships while attending the school. He later backtracked on the policy that saw him warning pupils he would give them a worse reference for universitythey got a boyfriend or girlfriend while attending Ruthin.A inspection report this week criticised the top private school in Denbighshire founded in , blasting it as aposinadequate,apos and describing the pupils as aposat risk of harmapos due to its poor leadership and safeguarding processes. The text messages were unearthed separately by the Times newspaper following the reportaposs publication just days ago.

Another message says: Iaposm not your principal any more so when we meet in Moscow youaposre a free lady.  Other text messages reportedly sent by Mr Belfield included one calling a pupil a naughty girl, and another complaining where is your love for your principal accompanied by broken heart emojis. In another series of messages to a female pupil, he complains he hasnapost seen any pictures of her in her lovely red dress and follows up telling her she looked stunning as always.  Sources told the newspaper the texts were to six girls, had been circulated in the north Wales community and had been passed to authorities. A  damning CIW report, published earlier this week, found pupils were at risk of harm amid a senior management culture that was both controlling and autocratic.  In another exchange, Mr Belfield is accused of telling a pupil the boarding schoolaposs staff had been warned was a apospotential sexual threat to young boys. The principal is also said to have bragged on social media about taking first-class and staying in five-star hotels on global recruitment drives to recruit pupils, who hail from countries including China, India and Nigeria. Teachers told the Times he had not been at the school since the end of last term. An insider told the newspaper a safeguarding concern had been raised with the school regarding the inappropriate messages allegedly sent by Mr Belfield. They said he had been suspended during a previous investigation then ed to the school.  The schoolaposs official website gives no indication of Mr Belfieldaposs whereabouts, and still prominently displays a welcome message from the principal on its site. School can be and should be a happy place, it says.The damning Care Inspectorate Wales report this week described the schoolaposs leadership under Mr Belfield as aposcontrollingapos and aposautocraticapos and noted low morale among staff.

David Lee had been trimming the heel of a shoe in his shop when his hand suddenly got caught in the machine and he was forced to watch his severed thumb drop onto the floor. After freeing himself, he immediately started thinking about how he would be able to earn a living after the accident.He told Derbyshire Live: “Straight away, I knew how bad it was and I just worried that I wouldn’t be able to fix shoes again. I cried my eyes out when I thought about it, as I thought I was going to lose my shop.“I was more concerned about that than my thumb because this is my passion. It all happened so fast but I felt no pain at all and straight away just turned all the machines off and actually went outside for a fag, while I waited for the ambulance!” David went to King’s Mill Hospital, in Mansfield, where he was then transferred to the Pulvertaft Hand Centre, at Royal Derby Hospital where the idea was put to him that a new “thumb” could be created using one of his big toes. Hearing that there could be a chance for him to carry on his job, David instantly said he would do it. He said: “As soon as it was put to me that attaching my toe gave me a chance to carry on my job, I instantly said let’s do it. I’d never heard of a procedure like this before but I also knew that the Royal Derby Hospital had the best hand surgical team in the country.” Five days later, David underwent the -hour operation surgeons spent around  hours, which has been performed only a handful of times at the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton and is only considered for patients with certain types of amputations. Miss Jill Arrowsmith, one of the two consultant hand surgeons who performed the operation, said: “This procedure is only offered to patients who have lost a lot of their thumb, usually down to close to the knuckle. “Not having any of the thumb can be very disabling, especially for those who do a manual job. This type of injury could mean that these patients are not able to remain at work, so we’re delighted to be able to provide this treatment option. “Toe-to-thumb reconstructions are quite rare but we have been really pleased with all of the outcomes these patients have achieved. There are lots of dferent ways to reconstruct thumbs but using the big toe gives the best al and cosmetic benefits, as it is the thing most like a thumb on the body.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email A grieving mum has shared a devastating image of her daughteraposs coffin in a desperate bid for an NHS law change.Mum-of-two Angela Bain, , is campaigning to enable families to escalate their concernsthey feel their loved ones are not receiving proper care after the death of her little girl Amy Lornie. She believes hospital medics aposignoredapos her pleas and failed to diagnose the five-year-oldaposs deadly brain tumour.Amy was just four when she fell ill in April  and visited doctors with vomiting, weight loss, headaches, lethargy, clumsiness and out-of-character mood swings.However it was five months before the youngster was scheduled for an MRI on August , the mum says. Angela claims that instead of conducting the scheduled MRI, medics left Amy screaming and writhing around in agony in her hospital bed for around nine hours. She says nurses repeatedly dismissed her concerns about her daughteraposs aposdeterioratingapos condition, instead giving Amy paracetamol that aposdid nothingapos to ease her suffering. When one nurse allegedly responded to Angelaaposs plea for help by askingAmy had missed her nap time and might just be tired, the mum demanded to see a doctor. But when Angela got back to her daughteraposs bedside, she says Amyaposs body was completely limp as she had stopped breathing - and the little girl would never wake up again. Doctors and nurses got Amy breathing again and rushed her for an MRI which revealed a large brain tumour and bleed on the brain. Despite emergency surgeries to relieve the pressure on Amyaposs brain and remove the tumour, Angela says it was too late for her daughter whose brain stem was apossquashedapos during the bleed. Angela also claims doctors who removed the tumour told her that Amy would have had an % chance of surviving with cancer treatment. After weeks hoping Amy would wake up to begin chemotherapy, the family made the heartbreaking decision to take the little girl off her le support and she died days later in Angelaaposs arms. The mum believesher concerns about Amyaposs worsening condition had been listened to, her daughter would still be alive. She is now campaigning for aposAmyaposs Ruleapos to be enforced.  Angela, of Aberdeen, Scotland, said: I was back and forth finding doctors, nurses, anybody because Amy was rolling around in bed absolutely screaming in pain. I was going crazy for somebody to listen. Iaposm normally a nice person, I donapost raise my voice. But I was angry, I was shouting, I was swearing. It was so frustrating. I knew something wasnapost right. They kept saying they would give her paracetamol but that wasnapost doing anything for her pain. It was horrible watching her suffer like that. Around pm I went to the nurse and told her Amy was deteriorating right in front of my eyes and she asked meAmy was tired because sheaposd missed her nap time. Amy was five, she hadnapost had nap time for a long time. I told the nurse I needed to speak to a doctor. When I got back to Amy, her body was just floppy. Sheaposd stopped breathing. After they rushed her away I remember thinking aposwhy did no one listen to meapos. I really didnapost recognise myself that night, I was so angry. She never woke up again after she stopped breathing. The last moments that Amy was Amy were just pure pain roaring out of her. Those are my last memories of her. I feel like I canapost really remember her voice, all I can remember is her screams. The surgeons got a really really sick little girl and did their best to try to fix her but it was too late. In reality she was gone before she even got to them. Her brain stem has been completely squashed. It was flat as a pancake.  aposHappyapos little girl Amy, who was aposfull of leapos and loved to sing and dance, first fell ill in April  when she became unable to keep food down due to bouts of aposviolentapos vomiting. Over the next five months, Amy visited her GP and out of hours hospital doctors several times - always with the same symptoms of sickness, loss of appetite, tiredness, headaches, clumsiness and mood swings. At first Amy was treated for a viral infection, then a urinary tract infection, then reflux and even referred to a dietician with possible food intolerances but nothing was helping. Mum Angela and her partner Ross Lowe, , watched in despair as Amyaposs weight plummeted, going from wearing clothes for five-year-olds to those for three-year-old. Some months all Amy could stomach was a teaspoon of water every five minutes, given to her night and day by Angela and Ross just to keep the little girl hydrated enough. When her daughter took a particularly bad turn on August  - just two weeks after her fth birthday - Angela took Amy to Royal Aberdeen Childrenaposs Hospital. Angela claims hospital nurses carried out tests, raising concerns about Amyaposs problems balancing and that one of her eyes appeared to be larger than the other. The mum-of-two says Amy was scheduled to have an MRI at the hospital the next day at pm but this didnapost happen until after pm when Amy stopped breathing. Amy was then taken for emergency surgery to put a shunt in her brain to relieve some of the pressure before she could be flown to Edinburghaposs Royal Hospital for Sick Children on August . In Edinburgh, surgeons were able to remove the entire tumour from Amyaposs brain and the mass was found to be a cancerous medulloblastoma growth. The oncologist allegedly told Angela that with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, Amy would have an % chance of beating the cancer completely and surviving. With newfound hope, the little girlaposs family waited for weeks for her to wake up for treatment but Amy never opened her eyes again.  Angela said: Amy was a happy little girl, everybody loved her. She was amazing. She was a natural performer and loved to sing and dance. She was obsessed with Cats the musical. She was just so full of le and then bang - she wasnapost anymore. The surgeons in Edinburgh couldnapost have done any more. When they managed to remove the whole tumour, it gave us a sense of hope. Thataposs what doctors do, they fix people. It was a huge shock to find out Amy had cancer. I knew something was really wrong for months but I never expected that. It was just unreal. It was like it wasnapost happening to me. It was like I was standing back watching somebody aposs le. But the oncologist was really hopeful. He told us Amy had an % chance of survival with treatment. She just needed to be awake for the treatment. As time went on and she wasnapost coming around, I realised there wasnapost going to be a happy ending. We know now that her brain stem was pretty much dead from the pressure of the tumour and the bleed. And the brain stem doesnapost regenerate. If she had just got to Edinburgh sooner,Aberdeen had done the MRI they scheduled,someone had listened to me when Amy was in pain, she would have survived. It all comes down to her diagnosis not being fast enough because thereaposs a complete lack of awareness of the symptoms of brain tumours in children. Itaposs not fair, she should still be here. She didnapost even get the chance to fight and she had a lot of fight to give. A medulloblastoma PNET is a malignanttumour formed from primitive or poorly developed brain cells, according to the NHS. Less than  children a year develop medulloblastoma in the UK. However, it is still the most common malignant brain tumour in children, representing % of all childhood brain tumours. They are most common in children between the ages of three and eight, and are slightly more common in boys than girls. Symptoms include: nausea and vomiting , lethargy and irritability, headaches, clumsiness, dficulty with tasks like handwriting, gradual decline in school work, changes in personality and behaviour and abnormal gait. After being informed that Amy would only live for three months without cancer treatment, her family made the heartbreaking decision to take her off le support. Amy was transferred to Rachel House Childrenaposs Hospice in Kinross where she took her last breath on September  while in her mumaposs arms. The family held a funeral on October  and Amy was buried in a white cat costume to honour her love for Cats the musical. Her tragic death has had a devastating impact on Amyaposs family with Angela still struggling to process what has happened. And Amyaposs big sister Melissa Lornie, eight, wants nothing more than to see her sibling again. Angela said: Taking Amy off le support was the hardest decision but we knew she was going to die anyway. I was lying on the bed and Amy was lying on me with her head on my chest when she took her last breath. It was really peaceful. There was no struggling. It sounded like a really contented sigh when youaposre sleepy. And then she didnapost breathe again. I think she was waiting for it to just be me and her. We hadnapost been alone for so long, there were always doctors and nurses and family but as soon as we were alone she took her last breath. To this moment, I donapost think I have fully processed whataposs happened. I know sheaposs gone because she died on me but at random points in the day it hits me again. Itaposs like I have been totally paralysed. Getting up in the mornings is hard but I have to for Melissa. When Amy died a part of me died too. Melissa is really not good, she misses her sister. None of us like being in our house anymore. Itaposs like being trapped. There are so many bad memories.

Andrea Horvathova was found unconscious at a property in Mutley, Plymouth, on the evening of Sunday March , . The hearing was told her boyfriend suggested she had taken a couple of lines of speed, a couple of lines of MDMA, and maybe ketamine, along with spiced rum. Senior coroner Ian Arrow noted the cause of death was given as sudden cardiac death brought on by her response to multiple drugs being consumed. He concluded he would record a verdict of drug related death. Police had also been called to the address after a group of people were reported to be under the influence of drink and controlled drugs, Plymouth Live reports. Andrea and another woman were both suffering the effects and raced to Derrord Hospital. The other woman survived, but Andrea died three days later on March , aged just . An inquest, presided over by senior coroner Ian Arrow noted how she had amphetamine, alcohol, Ecstasy, cocaine and a potent designer drug nicknamed Flakka in her system. Flakka - also known as Alpha PVP, or alpha-Pyrrolidinopentiophenone - is a stimulant that has had catastrophic effects on some communities in the United States. Plymouth Coroners Court heard a pathologistaposs toxicology report found Andreaaposs heart and liver had been damaged. The combination of drugs would have very likely resulted in a heart attack, the court heard. She had no physical injuries on her body. A statement from a close friend of Andreaaposs was read to the court.  She said she had known Andrea for two years and they regularly went to social events.She said Andrea, who was born in the Czech Republic, had revealed she had grown up in a care home and in June  had met a man called Alex whom she had a relationship with and had talked about going travelling with. The statement noted how Andrea and Alex had taken drugs together, but after their relationship ended Andrea began to take even more drugs, adding: she was upset by the end of the relationship. Her friend said Andrea worked in a factory and took le to the max and loved parties, saying up late, drinking and partying. She described Andrea as happy-go-lucky strong and independent woman. However, she then began another relationship with another man, who she lived with. At .pm on March  Andrea had emailed her friend askingshe could come around to visit. The pair later attended a small gathering at a house where Andrea began drinking.

The Duchess of Sussex, who was known for having strong political views before marrying in to the Royal family, will now be much more free to express herself publicly after the couple declared they would become financially independent. Speaking to the Daily Mail, a royal source said: The Duchess is said to be frustrated that she was forced to stay out of politics after getting engaged to Harry.She has strong political opinions and will now take advantage of the greater freedom she has to express them publicly. The course added that she could even intervene in the forthcoming US election, in plain defiance of royal tradition. The Queen - and by extension, the Royal family - tend to remain politically neutral.By convention, the Queen does not vote or stand for election and it seems that many of the other members of the Firm follow suit, even though they would technically be allowed to.But since Harry and Meghan announced that they are stepping back from their senior positions in the royal family, they could have more freedom to get involved with politics in Canada, where they are currently living, or in the US, where Meghan is originally from.Yet, it could still cause a diplomatic stormMeghan was to be openly critical of current senior politicians. In the past, Meghan has been outspoken about her political views, calling Donald Trumpmisogynistic and isive during his  presidential campagin.She also missed an official Royalwith Trump when he visited the UK in June as she was on maternity leave with her then-newborn son Archie. At the time, the President said he didnapost know that he wouldnapost be meeting Meghan during the visit, adding, I hope she is OK.  Before meeting Harry, Meghan allegedly discussed her political ambitions with Piers Morgan, telling him in : As a kid, I wanted to be either the president or a news broadcaster like you.That same year, she gave a speech at a United Nations event where she said: I am proud to be a woman and a feminist. In , a source who the Daily Mail claimed was a former associate of Meghan, said: Meghan was quite clear that she wanted to be president one day.  But Kensington Palace quashed the reports soon after, saying: This conversation you describe with an associate is fictious. Through her charity and showbiz work Meghan has already got friends in high circles, mixing with Barack and Michelle Obama along with US TV queen Oprah Winfrey. Best pal Jessica Mulroney is also well connected, as the daughter-in-law of Canadaaposs former prime minister Brian Mulroney.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA self-conscious singer who spent years aposlooking miserableapos claims sheaposs been cured of her aposresting b***h faceapos thanks to dramatic surgery. Paige Dobson, , would try and stop the skin on her chin aposcrease, pull and dimpleapos by keeping her expression neutral. But it left her looking aposconstantly miserableapos and appearing to permanently sport a aposresting b***h faceapos. But her le has been transformed after she underwent a gruelling five-and-a-half-hour operation on her jaw, which included a nose job. The op saw her jaws broken, realigned and secured in place with metal plates and screws. Speaking a year on from the surgery, Paige, from Netheravon, Wiltshire, said: Before my surgery I was so self-conscious and always avoided smiling. I hated having pictures taken and always covered half my face with my hand. Whenever I closed my mouth it would crease up andI laughed too much Iaposd be really gummy, it held me back from enjoying myself and being able to smile nicely in photos. The orthodontist said braces wouldnapost do anything because my overbite was so bad. When we looked back on pictures my mum always used to say aposPaige why have you got a resting b**** face apos She was obviously kidding, but it was from where my mouth was pulling so I constantly looked miserable. I felt it because I looked it - but now all I do is beam in photos. Paige suffered years of ridicule from cruel bullies who imitated the way she laughed and even followed her home from school, with the teen trying to hide her overbite by refusing to smile for pictures.  But since the le-changing surgery, Paige has gained so much confidence she now loves to smile - banishing her  b***h face once and for all. In addition to hating having pictures of herself taken, Paige also had to deal with bullies who mocked her appearance with cruel impersonations. Paige said: When I was  I got bullied to absolute hell. There was a group of people who would always make comments, laugh and impersonate how I would lookI was laughing, it was really cruel.  The main girl in this group got her boyfriend to follow me home from school and shout abuse at me for six months - it was so bad we had to get the police involved. After two-and-a-half years in braces, Paige underwent surgery, known as bimaxillary osteotomy, at Salisbury District Hospital in Odstock, Wiltshire, on January  . Surgeons broke Paigeaposs top and bottom jawbones and fixed her jaw in a new position with plates and screws.  Once theyaposd re-positioned her jaw, doctors realised her nose was off centre so they had to break her septum to be able to realign her nose with her jaw - effectively giving Paige a aposbonusapos nose job. The transformation was so radical that when Paigeaposs mum, -year-old hairdresser Tracey Dobson, walked into the room post-surgery she didnapost recognise her daughteraposs side profile. Paige said: I didnapost come round from the anaesthetic until pm that night.  When my parents came in the room my mum said as she walked towards me she took a step back and went to walk away because she didnapost recognise me as my side profile was already dferent. The operation hasnapost just changed my jaw itaposs changed my nose too - everything is completely dferent. Paige took six weeks off college where she was studying Performing Arts A levels to recover, and at the six-month mark had her braces removed. A year on from the op, Paige says she aposdoesnapost recogniseapos the person she sees in the mirror and feels like le has just begun.

White Maltichon Henry was out  with his -year-old owner when they were both caught up in the attack in in North Lanarkshire, Scotland on Thursday evening. The owner, who has not been named, suffered a minor injury after a bullet grazed her hand. Three thugs, armed with guns and knives, were targeting Marc McDermott, who was shot in the backside.Armed police raced to the scene just after pm and later found the attackers’ getaway car burned out nearby, reports the Daily Record.It’s understood McDermott had just parked a x car outside a family member’s house in the street before being pounced on by the gang as he got out.  Three masked men chased Mr McDermott before shooting him in the middle of an expensive housing estate in Cumbernauld. McDermott, , was being treated in hospital yesterday, where his condition was described as non-le threatening. The area was cordoned off for several hours yesterday as police carried out forensic searches nearby. A White Nissan Naa x was later seen being towed away by police. Last night, McDermottaposs partner Cheryl Fraser told the Record: “He doesn’t want to disclose anything for his safety.”Sources said trouble has flared after firebugs torched a house belonging to a major player in the Glasgow  underworld. It’s unclear why McDermott was involved in this revenge attack. It’s understood his daughter lives in the house which was targeted some months ago. A source said: “It’s not yet clearthis is a case of mistaken identity but the gunmen were ordered to carry out the attack after the house was torched and set on fire.  He has suffered two gunshot wounds to his lower body and is receiving treatment in hospital.”One local said: “You don’t expect a shooting in an estate like that which is full ofexpensive houses.”Last night police issued a major appeal to find the three attackers who are described as wearing dark clothing and possibly balaclavas. The silver Ford Focus was found a few miles away at Fannyside Mill near Blackthorn Roundabout at about .pm the same night.The partial registration plate is  ZKZ. Detective Chief Inspector Gillian Grant, senior investigating officer, said: “This was completely reckless and the fact this happened in a residential street shows the suspects had a complete disregard for the safety of the public. “A woman who was simply walking her dog has been left absolutely devastated. “There is an increased police presence in the area and reassurance patrols will be carried out.

What should have been the happiest day of her le was completely ruined because she spent the day knocking back detox shakes, resulting in disaster when she gambled on a fart and lost in a big way. She ended up ruining her £, dress, but refused to let that get that stop her from having a first dance with her husband in front of their nearest and dearest. But things went from bad to worse and ended up with the couple feeding each other wedding cake with poo-stained hands. The wedding planner was first alerted to the issue when she heard the dreaded words we have an issue over her headset. She took to Reddit to share the horrying details, which she admits still make her cringe. Her post has attracted more than , comments with most users being pretty grossed out by the turn of events and others labelling her a hero and a champ. Things didnapost exactly start well, and the planner claims the bride had been quite the bridezilla from day one. She wanted the reception to take place in a historic barn at one of the family properties, which caused numerous issues.  It had no water or electricity, leaving the planner to arrange for a bank of generators, buckets of water, additional auxiliary tents - as the barn wasnapost big enough to house all the guests. After hearing what had happened the planner told guests there would be a short delay before heading to the loo to help her poor assistant, who was cleaning the bride off with toilet paper. She claims the bride had let out a substance no human body should emit. She writes: Iaposm just looking at her manicured nails. Residue of diarrhea are just embedded in her nail bed. I start trying to scrape the poo out with a fabric stain wipe.  But the bride insisted the show went on. Despite the stench that she brought out of the bathroom with her - which the groom noticed - the newlyweds took their place on the dance floor to start the choreographed number. The planner writes: As the groom spun his bride around, hand on her waist, he is squishing the poo up the insides of the waist trainer, up and out the back waistband. To our horror, we watch as a oily stain spread across the mid back of the gown. As we are still cringing from this, the groom sets his hand firmly in the middle of the poo stain.

Itaposs a running joke with all of our friends that he always looks so confused, Jenner added. He was definitely overlooked because of his nose, which is weird because we think itaposs the most adorable thing about his look.  I was told that Big Dog Ranch Rescue, where we got him, took him all over the country to try and get adopted. But no one was interested and he stayed at Big Dog for over two years till we came along. Our other two dogs are rescues - Lyric, three, a Catahoula Leopard Dog, and Banjo, four, a Jack Russel who was dumped in a parking lot.

A dramatic video shows chaotic scenes as crowds of people wearing face masks while waiting to be tested fill jam-packed corridors of a hospital in Wuhan, where the virus originated. People who appear to be medical staff are seen in full protective body suits pointing and shouting as they try and make their way through the queues. In one disturbing scene, a patient appears to be slumped ill on a chair while a woman standing with him wails and shakes in apparent distress. Have you or a family member been affected by coronavirus  Contact webnews@mirror The video was recorded by someone waiting to be tested for the virus themselves, and provided to theby a source who did not wish to be identied. They said: The hospitals can’t keep up with the amount of people being tested and it’s resulting in people falling unwell and passing out. The country is in panic and a lot of people are sicker than theyaposre saying. They don’t have control of it.  The virus has killed  people in China and infected at least  others, including a case in Chicago and another near Seattle. France confirmed earlier this evening its first three cases of the Wuhan coronavirus, with one patient being hospitalised in Paris and another in the southwestern city of Bordeaux. Health Minister Agnes Buzyn told a news conference these were the first two confirmed cases in Europe and that more cases were likely to occur in France. earlier reported how tests for coronavirus on  people in the UK came back negative but there are checks ongoing on other people, according to the Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty. Mr Whitty spoke following a meeting of the Governmentaposs Cobra emergency committee in Whitehall, chaired by Health Secretary Matt Hancock. All the people tested in the UK had visited Wuhan.  In a statement, Mr Whitty said: I am working closely with the other UK chief medical officers. We all agree that the risk to the UK public remains low, but there may well be cases in the UK at some stage. We have tried and tested measures in place to respond. The UK is well-prepared for these types of incidents, with excellent readiness against infectious diseases. We have global experts monitoring the situation around the clock and have a strong track record of managing new forms of infectious disease.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email Teenager Ibolya Knill was wearing bright red high-heeled sandals when she was rounded up by Nazi troops in surprised raids on Jewish homes in Hungary.A week later, the -year-old was to marry, and in the pocket of her carefree summer dress nestled a pair of wedding rings she had just had engraved with the date of their big day: June , . Tragically, that date was to take on a very dferent signicance.For when the morning of June  finally arrived, Ibolya – known as Iby – still wearing her red heels and by now filthy summer dress, found herself crammed “like cattle” into a wagon heading to the notorious death camp Auschwitz in Nazi-occupied Poland.Where there should have been flutters of girlish excitement in her stomach, now there was just a heavy, gnawing sense of dread. There was no way of getting word to her fiancé, Gaspar, and there was no reasoning with the guards. “I went to them and said, ‘Today is supposed to be my wedding day’,” she recalls. “They said it made no dference. I didn’t talk of [Gaspar] again. There were a group of us in the wagon who decided to stick together. But we also decided to talk of nothing from the past, not our families or friends. It was our way of coping. I didn’t tell them.” Monday marks the th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz by Soviet troops. Iby, now , remains bright and resilient as she reflects on the devastating turn her le took. Originally from Bratislava, in what was then Czechoslovakia, she was born to a Jewish mother. After the Nazis invaded, she was smuggled to Hungary, where she lived with non-Jewish family of her father, carrying  documents that stated she was not a Jew. But in March , the Nazis also invaded Hungary. Iby was at the house of a Jewish friend that was raided, and she did not have her fake papers on her. Even with them she would have been in a precarious position, as she had been arrested and interrogated over her involvement in the resistance. She was also frightened of being caught out as an illegal immigrant. She confided these worries in a man she had recently met, Gaspar. He proposed, in the hope Hungarian citizenship would keep her safe.  Iby recalls: “We had only known each other for a matter of days, but I think he fell in love with me. “Under the circumstances, that was enough. People didn’t know what was going to happen to them, and le moved quickly. “He gave me money to buy the wedding rings and to get them engraved.” She would never see Gaspar, or those rings, again. Before she got on the transport to Auschwitz they were stripped from her, along with her earrings. The conditions of her five-day transport were appalling, and by the time she arrived at Auschwitz, exhausted and terried, Iby had every reason to feel utterly crushed. But instead, anger surged. Pushed onto the railway  of the death camp, she linked arms with friends she made during the journey.  Scared and starving though she was, Iby – in her defiant red heels – burst into the Hungarian national anthem, leading the group in song as they walked towards the camp’s notorious Angel of Death, Dr Josef Mengele. This was the man responsible for deciding which of the frailest new arrivals to send straight to the gas chambers. Her act of courage protected her and her new friends. She says: “We didn’t think we had anything to lose, and had been told to look livelywe wanted to live. Mengele laughed – he thought it was funny. I remember him – a very smart chap, with two dogs and two women in unorm behind him. He just waved us on through the gate. I was so angry. And that anger stayed with me. It helped me survive.” After her brush with Mengele, she was pushed into a “huge room”. “They stripped me of everything but my high heels – prisoners kept their shoes – they looked absolutely crazy.”  She is able to laugh a little, despite the horror of the memory. “Prisoners in striped pyjamas came and cut the hair all over our bodies. “We were pushed into showers and dressed in rags.” Iby was not tattooed with a registration number, because the tattooists ran out of ink. She has since found it out:  it remains ingrained in her mind. She was marched to Birkenau, the largest of the sub-camps within Auschwitz, where prisoners were crammed  to a hut. Chillingly, “There was no trees, grass or birdsong,” she recalls. Iby, who now lives in Leeds, West Yorks, has never ed to Auschwitz – and has no desire to ever go back. “I’m told it’s still the same, the atmosphere has stayed the same,” she says. They lived in just two rooms - one containing buckets for toilets and another to sleep in.  “The only way was to lie like spoons, heads on hips,” she says. “You had to fight your way outyou needed to get to the buckets in the night. But you wouldn’t be able to get back in. You’d have to sleep standing by the wall.” The prisoners called the green-flecked soup they were served from buckets ‘grass food’. “But the thirst was worse than the hunger,” she recalls. The only way she and the others knew which day it was, she says, was because once a week they were taken to be showered. The showers were in the same location as the notorious gas chambers – and Iby had no way of knowing to which they would be taken. Worst of all, she explains, was the smell that pervaded the camp. “The whole place smelt of burning flesh,” she says adding that she cannot attend a barbecue to this day.  She had no idea what had happened to her family, until one day a prisoner emptying the buckets told her that her mother was in Auschwitz, and searching for her. They never saw each other in the amp, but were reunited after the war. Later, Iby found out her father had been in Auschwitz, too. “But he was gassed – the very last time the gas chambers were used.” Iby herself left the death camp after “ days and  nights” – still wearing her red heels, with her rebellious spirit burning bright. Pretending to be a nurse, she volunteered for a slave labour transport to another camp, in the hope it would be better. As she waited to be loaded onto a wagon, a teenage girl approached. Iby recalls: “She was a twin. She and her sister and watched their parents go to the gas chambers, and were being experimented on by Josef Mengele. They knew that after that they would die. “She asked me,I survived, to tell the story of Auschwitz. I promised I would.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds starbucks closed china coronavirus","story":"NewsMcDonalds and Starbucks closed in China as coronavirus ruins Year of the Rat celebrationsPopular tourist destinations including Shanghai and Hong Kong are taking extreme measures in a bid to prevent the spread of the virusShareCommentsByFelix TamKara ONeill:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video what-know-new-form-coronavirus-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news mcdonalds-starbucks-closed-china-coronavirus-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

The city,  miles from virus epicentre Wuhan, has also shut down its cinemas in a bid to prevent the spread of the deadly illness, according to Bangkok Post.The disease has killed  people in China, with experts believing that number could continue to rise. Year of the Rat celebrations are also being cancelled around the country due to fears that gatherings of large crowds could help the virus spread at an alarming rate. The Lunar New Year is the countryaposs biggest holiday, and a time when many people would travel to visit family. Today, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam declared a virus emergency in the Asian financial hub, announcing several measures to limit the cityaposs links with mainland China. Schools, already closed for the holiday, will now remain shut until February , while inbound and outbound flights and high speed rail trips between Hong Kong and Wuhan have been halted. Lam said confirmed that all official visits to the mainland and official Lunar New Year celebrations would be scrapped immediately.She also said she had sought the assistance from Chinaaposs State Council to ensure on-going mask supplies were adequate. They may also ask universities to extend holidays too. Lamaposs statements came hours after she ed from the World Economic Forum in Davos and amid broader tensions as her team grapples with at times violent anti-government protests that have rumbled on for seven months. I hereby urge all citizens stay united to fight against the epidemic to protect all Hong Kong peopleaposs health and safety, Lam said. She added that it would be impractical to shut down all border crossings with the mainland. Some protesters have railed against growing interference from Beijing seeking to curb the cityaposs freedoms while others have expressed fear over greater integration with the mainland. The cityaposs health authorities have confirmed  coronavirus cases, all linked to Wuhan, where the virus first appeared, with a further  people being treated as suspected of having the disease. The first case was confirmed on Wednesday, a -year-old man visiting from Wuhan who crossed by high-speed rail from neighbouring Shenzhen.The condition of one of the people confirmed with the virus deteriorated on Saturday and the patient was now on a respirator, Hong Kongaposs government funded broadcaster RTHK reported.Hong Kong earlier deployed temperature screening equipment at the airport and the high-speed rail station. Air passengers are required to fill in health declaration forms while isolation wards have been set-up in hospitals.Reuters witnesses have described the widespread use of masks in offices and on public transport, a reflection of the cityaposs strong memories of an earlier coronavirus crisis.

Meanwhile the UK Government, led by Boris Johnson, has busied itself trying to convince taxpayers to raise £, in order to make the currently out of commission Big Ben ring again on #Brexit Day#.But what about ordinary Dundonians on the street – have punters really been that worried about the upcoming split “I’ve done no preparation at all,” said Val King, an admin assistant from Forfar.“It has come round quite quickly. I think everyone will be much the same they’ve been busy with Christmas, and this has just been ongoing the whole time.“You’ve had this thing about Big Ben, which has been absolutely ridiculous. What a waste of money.“You only have to look around and see how many people there are on the streets to know the money could be better spent.”Alex Simpson, , an art student at DJCAD, said: “I wasn’t old enough to vote at the time of the vote so people my age didn’t get a chance to have a say.“It’ll just be a case of seeing what happens. I don’t think anyone can really believe it’s happening though.“I really don’t think it will make much dference to people’s day-to-day lives, they’ll still get up and go about their day the same.”Monica Anderson, a retired council worker from Dundee, admits she’s still uncertain as to whether Brexit will actually take place.But she is hopeful it does – even though she was a remain voter in .Monica said: “I’m still waiting on it actually happening. I’m still doubtful it will actually happen because it has dragged on so long – but I would like to see it happen.“I voted remain before, but I don’t want Scotland to become independent from the UK so I would like to see Brexit happen.“I don’t think we should held hostage by politicians in Brussels. If there was another vote I would vote leave again.“I would say people are fed up – by now it is either going to happen or it’s not.”Sandy Robertson, , a former jute factory worker from Forfar, was less optimistic – and thinks leaving the EU is a mistake.He said: “I still think we should remain. Things should just be left the way they are. I think the English voters made a mistake when they voted to leave and we’re just having to put up with it.“It wasn’t Scottish voters who voted to leave.“I think there were a lot of people in the farming and fishing industries who influenced people to vote leave as well.“It’s just been a big mess that we’ve been dragged into against our will.”Earlier this month city councillors approved the latest recommendations put forward by officers to prepare Dundee  for Brexit.In his report before the council’s policy and resources committee, chief executive David Martin warned that Brexit continued to hold “signicant financial and operational risks” for the council.He wrote: “Both the Cross Party European Group and the officers’ Brexit Advisory Team have continued to meet regularly to consider the risks facing the council and the city in order to make any preparations possible.“Staff in frontline services across the council, including libraries and community centres, as well across our community planning partners, have been briefed and given a handout to support and signpost citizens.“In addition, we have worked with Dundee and Angus Chamber of Commerce to promote the scheme to their members and ensured welfare rights advice services across the city are briefed.#He said that the chamber had also recruited additional staff resources to support export documentation and to assist in wider preparedness work.In addition to that, elected members had been given information in case constituents raised queries via their surgeries.Mr Martin said: “Dundee’s Central Library is a location for the Assisted Digital Scheme for those needing help to make online applications, and we are also publicising the assistance available locally from the Citizens Advice Bureau.“The Children and Families Service and the Health and Social Care Partnership have been made aware of responsibilities for applications on behalf of looked after children and vulnerable adults.”He said that the impact on servicesthe council#s workforce was reduced as EU nationals left the country was low.  but that the authority had sought to re-assure those affected that we want them and their families to stay, and to signpost them to information and support.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e2ab665786043.48396401.jpg ","title":"callachan aiming to end below par east end record with dark blues","story":"East End Park is a venue Ross Callachan is no stranger to.In his six years in the Raith Rovers first-team, he took part in the Fe derby four times, twice in Dunfermline.On neither occasion, however, was the -year-old able to end up on the winning side.But Callachan is hoping to change all that tonight when he heads there as a Dundee player after joining on loan until the end of the season from St Johnstone last week.The Pars are on a poor run of form themselves, losing their last five in the league.However, Callachan insists that counts for nothing and all the Dark Blues can focus on is doing what’s required to earn all three points after the disappointment of exiting the cup to Motherwell in his debut last weekend.“I’ve played them a few times home and away but it’s always tough going to East End,” he said.“They’ll be looking to win, losing their last five games, so I think it’s a must-win for both teams.“It was disappointing to be out of the cup but at least we can focus on the league now.“We have  games left until the end of the season so, hopefully, we can go and push for the play-offs.”Callachan is realistic, however, and knows the pitfalls of the Championship from his time at Raith.With just four points separating Dundee in fourth and the Fers in fth, he hopes to draw on all his experience to help the Dee in this one and every game after.“It’s very tough.

I’ve been in the league before with Raith and in the play-offs, too. I’ve been there and done it all before.”Although keen to kick on and help the Dark Blues this term, Callachan is just happy to be playing again after enduring a long spell out of the team at Saints.He only made four appearances for the Perth men this season, the last coming in September, and is enjoying feeling wanted again.“I’m hungry to play, do well and help the team,” he said defiantly.“I want to get games under my belt because it was frustrating at St Johnstone.“You’re sitting in the stands and you feel you can help the team but the manager thought otherwise.“I’m just happy somebody wants me here and I feel like I’ve fitted in right away.“Hopefully, I can go and play and show what I can do.“The initial attraction was Dundee were interested in me. My head was turned right away.“Obviously, not playing at St Johnstone made me want to come here.“The plan is to help the club get to where it wants to be, back in the Premiership.“We’re in the play-off spots now so, hopefully, we push and climb up to second.“Dundee United are going to win the league so the main thing for us is getting to the play-offs and going up that way.“We want to finish as high as possible.”Playing alongside and learning from quality players like Graham Dorrans is another reason why Callachan was happy to make the switch up the A, across Tayside.And he was delighted to see his team-mate sign a new deal this week.“He’s, obviously, played at a right high level and you can tell he’s a good player who can help the team.“Him signing a new deal can only be good for us.“It’s good for everyone we have that competition.“It’s good for the club and for the boys, competition is always good.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/shutterstock_1593132328-775x564.jpg ","title":"clean rabbies napper teles call to dundee city council to get bird dirt off statues head","story":"Scotland#s national bard will be celebrated across the world tomorrow but the Tele has issued one demand to the city council ahead of Burns Night: Clean Rabbie#s napper.The Robert Burns monument, which can be found outside the McManus galleries, has stood in the city since  and is a symbol of pride for many in both Scotland and Dundee.It is one of four identical statues commemorating the Scotsman across the world, with the others being found in Dunedin, New York and London.However, the effigy has fallen victim to attacks from above in recent years, with seagulls and pigeons leaving droppings on the poor bard#s head.The sorry state of the statue has encouraged the Tele to make a stand and demand Rabbie is shown the respect he deserves.An offer to send a Tele reporter up to clean it ourselves was rebuffed by council chiefs # so now it#s up to the local authority to have it gleaming again.Many Dundonians agree with our view and Cullen Armstrong, , who works part-time at Thorton#s Law, said: #It just needs people with a scrubbing brush to go up and give it a good clean.#I don#t know how you#d protect it from the birds, but it definitely needs a good clean.#Connor Ferguson, a -year-old security consultant from the Hilltown, also believes the poet#s likeness could do with a bit of a clean up.He said: #Well obviously it needs the bird droppings cleaned off it.#It could do with a bit more care and attention, so it looks good for all the tourists that are coming into the city.#Hilltown resident Simon Young, a -year-old therapist, said: #I was just thinking that it wasn#t looking its best.#It absolutely could do with a clean.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road .

Christmas time had been dficult because it was the first Christmas without her granny, who had died earlier in the year. But now she was back at school and into the routine with her friends.Her parents had hoped this would help, but her sense of loss was still overwhelming for her. Perhaps at her age she didnrsquot understand exactly what was going on inside, but all she knew was that her granny shersquod loved was gone and she missed her.Then one evening during a bedtime story, Jessica started to cry and told her dad that her granny was melting like a snowman. At first he wasnrsquot sure what she meant, but then he understood.Jessicarsquos memory of her granny was fading. This was a second loss for her. The first loss was of her grannyrsquos physical presence, her actual hugs, her voice and care and love, even the smell of her perfume. Now Jessica was losing her memory of all this and she knew it. So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum. It was a terrying thought and it made her not just sad but scared and insecure inside.Her dad tried to reassure her that he or her mum werenrsquot going to die, but despite being only six years old, Jessica now knew that such promises couldnrsquot be kept forever.ldquoNana didnrsquot want to die either, but she did. And now shersquos melting.The next day at school was another dficult one for Jessica, and home time often didnrsquot make it better because in the past it had usually been her granny whorsquod picked her up.Her dad was waiting for her.ldquoWe are not going straight home today, he told her.ldquoWhere are we going ldquoTo Nanarsquos seat.A cloud suddenly came over Jessica.

Inside, her emotions were spinning. Then she looked up.ldquoI donrsquot want to, it will just make me sad, she said to her dad. So they didnrsquot go.But later that day, Jessica began to talk about Nanarsquos seat. ldquoShe always gave me sweeties and wersquod look for whales and pirates. She told me a story about how a pirate once landed here at Prestonpans, but he didnrsquot leave treasure, he just built the town.ldquoGreat story, said her dad.The next day, Jessica agreed to go to her nanarsquos seat. When they arrived, she hesitated to sit and had a wave of emotion.ldquoI miss Nana, she saidldquoSo do I. Shall we sit on her seat and miss her together.ldquoBut we have to eat sweeties.ldquoJust so happens Irsquove got some in my pocket, said the dad with a smile. His daughter smiled back and sat on the seat. Her dad joined her.ldquoNo, dad, that was Nanarsquos place, you sit this side instead.And so they sat, missing Nana together, being sad together, but also remembering her together.ldquoCan you tell me the story about the pirate  asked the dad.ldquoDonrsquot want to.ldquoOK, maybe next time.The next day, they ed to Nanarsquos seat. This time, Jessica told a bit of the pirate story. The dad remembered it from his childhood and realised that his own grief in losing his mother had closed him down to talking about her. It had felt too painful.He began to sit on lsquoNanarsquos seatrsquo by himself when Jessica was at school, even though he had never done it with his mother when she was alive he had always been lsquotoo busy to watch the sea with her.

Her dad even began to tell funny stories about his mum from when before Jessica was born, when he was a boy.lsquoNanarsquos boxrsquo was put in a safe place, but where Jessica could take itshe wanted to.

And it ainrsquot pretty. In fact, itrsquos getting downright scary, especially as every week the narrative seems to sht closer to the isive and damaging - but also very deliberate - culture wars being waged in Trumprsquos America.We witnessed this first hand over the last couple of weeks with the grim spectacle of groups of well-spoken middle class white men, mostly of a certain age, being rounded up and brought into television studios to sit on sofas next to black women and explain to them not only what racism is and is not, but also why theirlived experiences of it are worthless. And, when the women speakers pointed out the irony and injustice of this set-up  Calm down dear, yoursquore getting hysterical.Question Time provided perhaps the most eye-watering example of this when actor Lawrence Fox - who had been invited to sit in the ldquovoice of the people chair - unleashed a shocking but very revealing attack on a mixed-race member of the audience who suggested Meghan Marklersquos treatment by the media and others had been racist.:The curse of the House of Windsor: how love has torn apart the royal familyMr Fox, a Harrow-educated member of an established acting dynasty known for his role in the detective series Lewis, tore into the woman - who it turns out is an academic researcher in race and ethnicity - talking over her, aggressively calling the suggestion of racism ldquoboring, adding imperiously: ldquoWersquore the mostly tolerant, lovely country in the world.\" The actor compounded matters by using the tired and predictable ldquoyoursquore the racist defence when quite reasonably questioned on how a spfing white chap like him could be so sure about what racism is and is not.:Netflix chief confirms interest in deal with Harry and MeghanI donrsquot doubt that from Mr Foxrsquos privileged perch, Britain is indeed tolerant and lovely.

Laughably, most of the similar types Irsquove met in le honestly believe they earn their opportunities on merit.The ennui of privilege, eh  They tend to be bored with uppity totty of all races, of course. Theyrsquore probably terribly fed up with feckless poor people banging on about foodbanks, and moany, chippy Jocks, too.Itrsquos the soaring confidence of such attacks and pronouncements that really concerns me, however, the increasingly loud and proud tone of them, the whf of US right-wing s like Fox News, Breitbart and One American News Network.Indeed, rather than apologising or stepping back from his embarrassingly outburst on Question Time, Mr Fox, who has been roundly criticised by his profession, saw fit to launch a defence of his actions, including a barrage of mocking, wince-inducing tweets packed with right-wing US tropes around ldquoliberals and ldquowokeness. Whatrsquos going on  We simply wouldnrsquot have tolerated such behaviour in public  years ago.But with Boris Johnson in Number , a man who defends his writings about ldquopiccaninnies with ldquowater melon smiles, ldquobum boys ldquogirly swats and how voting Tory will ldquogive your we bigger breasts, I suppose such behaviour has both permission and a champion.Make no mistake, the faction of the Tory party that has taken over Britain in the wake of Brexit will revel in and stoke culture wars of this kind. It feels threatened by attacks on pale, male stale dominance, of course.

But Scotland could still offer the national income of Portugal with the population of Slovakia.:Nicola Sturgeon to set out plan for Scottish independence referendum next weekSo, we can forget the  nonsense about going to the end of the queue or being blocked by Spain. There is now a reservoir of goodwill, especially in the European Parliament, following Scotlandrsquos determined resistance to Brexit. Wersquod be back in, probably within - years according to Kirsty Hughes of the Scottish Centre on European Relations.However, there is one small problem. Scotland would have to be fully independent first. Unless Scotland has a referendum in this transition year there is no longer any prospect of Scotland, as it were, remaining in the European Union as rUK leaves. We may still be under the same regulatory environment as Europe in the transition period, but donrsquot think that can just be extended as in Northern Ireland.Mentioning the Irish backstop is not the way to get a sympathetic hearing in the European Union. Many states are unhappy about Northern Ireland being allowed to remain, effectively, in the European single market without being part of the EU or the EEA.It breaks all the rules. And Scotland can forget about being given similar treatment. Speaking to Brussels officials this week confirms that there will be no read-across to Scotland from the Northern Ireland protocol. They wonrsquot even discuss it.So, there is no half way house. Scotland needs to take the leap into full independence. That means having a central bank and an autonomous currency before Scotland could become a candidate for accession. There are two problems here, but they arenrsquot insurmountable.Scotland would have to formally agree to the Maastricht Treaty, and membership of the euro. It is most unlikely that Scotland would get a formal opt-out from the euro, but it could drag its feet for a very long time, like Sweden. Whether Scotland would want to is another matter. Euro membership has worked well for many small countries.A more dficult issue is convergence. Scotland would have to show that its economy meets the terms of the stability pact, which means having a deficit of less than three per cent. At present, according to the GERS figures, Scotland has a deficit of more than twice that.However, after independence these numbers would almost certainly change. There will be a lot of fiscal give and take between Scotland and the rest of the UK over assets and liabilities.But Scotland would have to show that it is capable of harnessing its currency to the euro, evenit doesnrsquot actually join it. Currency autonomy might be hard to establish , as in the Scottish Governmentrsquos scenario, Scotland keeps using the pound for a decade after independence.: In post-Brexit Britain, Nicola Sturgeon cant keep telling her troops that Indyref is round the corner. It isntIf a nominally independent Scotland were still subject to interest rates operating in a country that is outside the European Union, that would be a dficult sell. The EU is very good at finding novel ways to get round problems like this. But it might take a few years.There may be a trade deal on regulations between the UK and the EU that solves some of Scotlandrsquos accession and border problems. We just donrsquot know. This is one of the imponderables of Scottish independence. It is actually very dficult to make a clear prospectus for indyref when we donrsquot yet know how the UK is going to stand in relation to the EU.But there is a bigger question than all of these: would Scotland necessarily want to rejoin the European Union  Nicola Sturgeon takes it as read, but there would be a debate at the very least. Around a million Scots voted for Brexit and many of them were supporters of independence.Brussels has had some bad press in the last decade. Austerity policies were imposed after  which were worse than in the UK and caused problems across the Mediterranean states. Its behaviour toward Greece during the sovereign debt crisis would have shamed the British Empire at its worst.Brussels stood idly by while one member state, Spain, imposed draconian repression in Catalonia, breaking heads and locking up elected politicians. There was scarcely a word from Brussels, let alone sanctions. Then there is fish.Many in the independence movement believe the EU is a neoliberal club ndash which it is ndash and would be happier with an arrangement like Norwayrsquos which has control of fishing grounds, is not subject to EU rules and has a managed economy. The case for a referendum before Scotland rejoined the EU would seem to me to be unanswerable.At the very least, the SNP could not take it for granted. Unionists will continue to argue that it makes little economic sense for Scotland to leave the Union with the UK, which is where the majority of Scottish exports go. There would be a hard border, currency controls, possibly tarfs.Ms Sturgeonrsquos problem is that the very arguments the SNP used against leaving the European Union ndash freedom of movement, zero tarfs, regulatory harmony ndash apply equally to leaving the United Kingdom. Theyrsquoll come winging back. Aversion to Boris Johnson may not be enough to persuade Scots to take the biggest leap in  years.Read more: Sturgeon cant keep telling her troops that Indyref is round the corner"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-14-people-tested-uk-five-negative-nine-await-results","story":"Fourteen people were tested for the virus, with five confirmed negative and nine still awaiting results, Public Health Englandsaid on Thursday night.The Scottish Government had earlier confirmed that five people were being examined after presenting with symptoms of the illness, while it was understood that another patient was being tested at Belfastrsquos Royal Victoria Hospital.:Helen McArdle: It is disappointing to see more evidence of bias, conflicts of interest and hidden data in sciencePHE would not give a breakdown of where the people were tested and where the negative results were recorded.While none of the UK cases has been confirmed as the virus so far, two of those being tested in Scotland had been diagnosed with influenza after travelling to Wuhan, China.They all travelled to Scotland from Wuhan, where the outbreak is thought to have originated, within the past two weeks, and were showing symptoms of respiratory trouble, a red flag for the virus.Downing Street said four suspected cases in Scotland were believed to involve Chinese nationals.It comes after infections expert Professor Jurgen Haas claimed there would likely be ldquomany more cases around the country, while Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the NHS is ldquoready to respond appropriately to any cases that emerge in the UK.In a statement to the Commons on Thursday, Mr Hancock said while ldquothere is an increased likelihood that cases may arise in this country, we are well prepared and well equipped to deal with them.Also on Thursday, the World Health Organisationsaid it is ldquotoo early to declare an international public health emergency over the outbreak ldquogiven its restrictive and binary nature.Speaking at a press conference, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, said: ldquoMake no mistake, this is though an emergency in China.ldquoBut it has not yet become a global health emergency.ldquoIt may yet become one.He said  cases have been reported to the WHO, including  deaths, with  of the overall cases and all the deaths reported in China.Other cases have been reported in Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, the US and Vietnam.Dr Tedros said: ldquoWe know that most of those who have died had underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease, that weakened their immune systems.:Coronavirus: Too early to declare public health emergencyldquoWe know that there is human-to-human transmission in China, but for now it appears limited to family groups and health workers caring for infected patients.ldquoAt this time, there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission outside China, but that doesnrsquot mean it wonrsquot happen.ldquoThere is still a lot we donrsquot know.

One time, it was because I caused a scene over a stolen jacket, but usually, it was because I was drunk and being a bit of an ****. One thing I can say, though, is that Irsquove never been thrown out of a nightclub because of my beliefs.But this is what appears to have happened at the Polo Lounge in Glasgow. The Polo is a LGBT venue in the centre of town, and according to a video on social media, a woman was kicked out of the club recently for wearing a T-shirt bearing the logo ldquoLGB Alliance. Some people are said to have complained the T-shirt was anti-trans and the woman was told to turn it inside-out or she would have to leave.The womanrsquos reaction to the situation was pretty much the reaction of everyone whorsquos ever been kicked out of a club: it wasnrsquot me. ldquoIrsquove just been removed, she said, ldquobecause trans people, who I didnrsquot even see, said I was threatening to them... Donrsquot I have the right to support lesbians, gays and bisexuals  Trans people, she went on, had the power to have her kicked out because they didnrsquot like an acronym on a T-shirt.:We must fight against the rolling back of trans rightsI realise the street outside a nightclub in the early hours of the morning is not the best place for nuance, but I wish we had more subtlety in this debate. My sympathy ndash instinctively and empirically ndash is with the nightclub I am a supporter of the right of trans people to identy their gender and to have all the rights of that gender. But I also dislike the idea of people who do not agree with a particular view being excluded from a public place.That said, I understand why many LGBT people dislike the LGB Alliance. Take their horrible website for a start. Therersquos nothing critics of trans reform seem to love more than pictures of trans women who do not ldquopass as women, which may explain why the LGB Alliance website is full of pictures of beautul, thin people and women who conform to traditional feminine images ndash they ldquolook like women in other words.Therersquos an unpleasant air of supremacy about the pictures and they make me deeply uncomfortable.Some of the language on the site is also worrying. I was speaking to Michael Cashman, the co-founder of Stonewall, the other day, and, although we didnrsquot talk about the Glasgow case specically, what he said on trans rights was interesting. Young peoplersquos attitudes to gender are in advance of older peoplersquos, he said, but he also believes some of the ways in which trans people have been portrayed are similar to the way gay men used to be portrayed ndash as a threat to children for example. ldquoDangerous to children is a phrase that appears on the LGB website, along with multiple uses of the word ldquothreat. We have been here before.The fact that some gay people have signed up to the LGB Alliance does not change its flaws.They do not explain, for instance, in what way the right to self-identication is a ldquomortal threat to gay rights. They also do not appear to acknowledge that legislating for equality involves a balancing of rights and risks. And they certainly do not explain on whose authority they seek to remove the T from LGBT. They do not have that right.: Scotland can learn lessons from Canada on trans best practiceIrsquom not saying their views are extreme ndash far from it, opposition to trans equality is not an unusual opinion, which is why we should take a nuanced view of the woman who was thrown out of Polo.What she was doing was insensitive and many people will have found her shirt offensive and unpleasant, but in Britain you are allowed to be insensitive, offensive and unpleasantyou want to be.My advice to the woman, had she asked me, would have been to get over herself and not to go to a gay bar wearing that shirt, because why would you want to upset people in a place where they feel safe But my advice to the club would have been to let her stay. Anyone who goes to a gay bar and claims therersquos no T in LGBT is being insensitive and provocative, but the gay bar can be better.It can say: we are a liberal, mature and progressive place we are tolerant and we tolerate even you."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10941551.jpg?type=article-full","title":"jeanie-smoking-cigarette-love-loss","story":"Maybe wersquod have gone out for a meal or gone to the movies. You loved the movies. You werenrsquot fussy. At some point Irsquod have kissed you and told you I loved you, like I did every other day.But not this birthday. Not this year. For the first time since  I wonrsquot be able to do any of that.Ah, Jeanie.My we Jean died on October  last year at .am in Strathcarron Hospice. Outside, birds were singing.Shersquod been in the hospice for a couple of days. On the Thursday it had reached the point where I was no longer able to look after her properly at home.I had spent the Friday night trying to sleep in a chair beside her bed. Every so often Irsquod lean over and talk to her as she slept, letting her know I was there. Or so I hoped. The voice gets through, one of the hospice nurses had told me.Just after eight her breathing changed. It began to slow and slow as I held her hand and cried. And then it stopped.Such a strangely peaceful thing, I remember thinking in between the tears. Nothing traumatic. Just a sht into stillness.An ending, one that had been waiting for us since she was first diagnosed with breast cancer in .Shards of memory from that morning keep coming back to me. They still cut me open. The face of the nurse I spoke to earlier that morning as the enormity of what was ahead of me was finally sinking in the same nurse who came through the door  minutes later when Jean stopped breathing. The drive down the hill to Denny knowing that I had to tell Jeanrsquos mother and sisters, our daughters, what had happened.And then the drive back. The final moments we spent with her, all the words we didnrsquot get to sayunspoken.I am writing this three-and-a-half months later. No time at all. An eternity.Most mornings I reach across the bed to where she should be, where she isnrsquot. I go through each day knowing that the person I have loved most in this world is no longer in it.I want to hear her say my name one last time. I have been trying to remember the last time she did. Somewhere in the couple of weeks before she died, I guess, before illness took language away from her. A last time that I didnrsquot realise would be the last.The thing I struggle to get my head around is the way she is somehow everywhere and nowhere now. Every road I drive down, every song I hear on the radio, she is in them. Everything is a trigger, everything points to once-insignicant memories now charged and potent, small moments from the past suddenly weighed down with an impossible weight of loss and longing.I have nothing original or unique to say about grief. Irsquom sorry. No eloquence, no insight. Mostly itrsquos a drudge illuminated by spikes of pain.The truth is, I suspect Irsquom still only in the foothills anyway. I cry most days. Sometimes I prompt it deliberately bring her to mind in a way I know will hurt, like sticking a needle into an open wound, just to remind myself that Irsquom feeling something.Other times I try to distract myself. Football on the radio, bad movies on the telly, books that seem a safe distance from her memory.But griefrsquos a sneaky f***er. Last week I was reading a passage in a book about starfish. My subconscious made the connection for me. From starfish I thought of the word seahorse and suddenly I remembered Jeaniersquos tattoo, little black ribbons and bars of ink in the shape of a cartoon-cute seahorse.And, in the same moment, I realised that I hadnrsquot thought about it since she died. How was that even possible  Was it on her left arm or her right arm  Suddenly I wasnrsquot sure. was the cruellest year. On the last day of  we were told we had run out of treatments. In May we were told Jeanie had, at best, a few months. Before we left, I remember, her oncologist gave her a hug.How did we get through the rest of that day  Itrsquos a blank to me now.Weeks passed. Irsquod repeat my mantra to her most days. ldquoYoursquore okay today, so things are okay. I was in a state of deep denial. Jeanie knew better.By July and August it was clear that her illness was beginning to have a real impact. She began to lose memory and speech. It seemed a final cruel punishment for someone so articulate, so engaged with the world. The last weeks were marked by her slow withdrawal from all of us, a withdrawal that became final on that October morning.Three-and-a-half months ago. No time at all. An eternity.ldquoNo tenses any more, the poet Denise Riley writes in Time Lived, Without its Flow, her essay about grief in the wake of the sudden death of her son. ldquoHis sudden death has dropped like a guillotine blade to slice through my old expectation that my days would stream onwards into my coming le. Instead, I continue to sense my daily le as paper-thin. As it is. But this cut through any usual feeling of chronology leaves a great blankness ahead.No tenses any more. In truth, we both had been living in a continuous present for years, ever since Jean was first diagnosed. The first mention of the word cancer cut away the notion of a future.She was diagnosed in the autumn. ldquoIrsquoll not see Christmas, she told me then. We saw another . But even so the future, or the idea of it at least, had been taken from us, even as we grew older and watched our kids grow up.Worse, the past had been taken from us as well. It was too painful for her to think about. Even everyday intimacies and nothing-special moments were out of bounds. We had the present and nothing . And now I donrsquot even have that. I am already living in that great blankness that Riley talks about.That said, maybe I have the past again. I can revisit it. And I do.Most days I find myself fantasising about going back in time, inserting myself into a moment we once shared. It doesnrsquot have to be anything special. Just as long as we are together, where I can hear her voice, where I can see her face, where I can touch her arm, her cheek, know that she is there with me. Given the choice right now, I would live forever in that moment. Reliving it again and again.In some ways I already am. Just before Christmas I had our wedding video transferred to DVD so I could watch it. I donrsquot think I had ever watched it before,Irsquom honest. Now I canrsquot stop.Itrsquos not really a wedding video, just some footage my friend Mark filmed that day back in . Watching it again took me back to our old flat in Bruce Street, Stirling. There are our two cats, my sister-in-law looking impossibly young, my dad, Jeaniersquos dad, now no longer with us. And here are friends who have drted out of our lives.But, really, when I watch it, Irsquom only watching Jeanie. She would have been  when it was filmed. God, she looks beautul. She had her make-up done professionally that morning and she hated it. And yet on video itrsquos clear how great it looks on her.She hated being filmed. It explains why she hardly says anything in the video. That was not like her at all. I wish she had said more on camera, just so I can hear her speak. But the fact that she is there is enough, occupying a space in this world, a grainy image of her physical presence that is now out of touch.Already there is a moment in the video I find myself waiting for every time I put it on. At one point she comes through the swing doors that separated our kitchenette from the living room and, as the camera adjusts to the March light streaming through the window, itrsquos clear she is smoking. Jeanie is smoking.I had almost forgotten. How could I have forgotten  It had been something she had done as long as Irsquod known her.She would give it up a year, maybe  months, later with the same steely self-will she later brought to learning to play guitar or speak Esperanto. A task to be achieved.But in the fuzzy, flickering yellow video light, the image rolling and glitchy with age, she can be seen drawing fumes into her lungs with such obvious pleasure that the sight of it felt like a depth charge in my head, a memory of who she once was, of the girl I first met in a student kitchen in Stirling University in September . We were both  then. She was barefooted and wearing a headscarf because her hairdresser had given her a buzzcut, much to her disgust.She sat there smoking and swearing and talking. She was this leforce. I donrsquot know how  to describe her. She was self-confident and outgoing, all the things I wasnrsquot. I was totally smitten. What she saw in me, I still donrsquot know.In time I realised that we had some things in common. We were both working-class kids in a still largely middle-class environment. She had her own vulnerabilities like everyone . Irsquom not sure what I represented to her, but I was happy to represent something, anything.I asked her out. In the most roundabout of ways. And she said no. And then she said yes. And that was the start of the rest of our lives. We got together, stayed together, grew up, got married, had kids, were happy.In my head there are all these dferent versions of Jeanie the -year-old firebrand, the thirtysomething mother, the dedicated professional , the girl who would get drunk with her dad and her sisters every Hogmanay and start singing Leaving on a Jet Plane. The Jeanie who immersed herself in anything that interested her. The Jeanie who could make you laugh just by the way she looked at you.For a few days after her death I found myself resentful about the last incarnation of Jeanie, the one who increasingly was drting away from us, the one I had been caring for in the last weeks of her le. I loved that version too, of course, but the memory of this last Jeanie was so close, so tight against me, that I couldnrsquot see past her to all the others Irsquod spent the best part of  years with.It took my friends Karina and Michael to put me right. Jean and I had met Karina for a coffee in September just before Karina went back to Buenos Aires to look after her own sick mother. It was a farewell meeting. We all knew it.A few weeks later, after Jeanrsquos funeral, Michael told me what Karina had told him about that day, about how, when I was off where for a few moments, Jeanie had told her that she knew what was happening to her and that she was at peace with it.Hearing that felt like a damn breaking inside me. My viewpoint shted  degrees. Suddenly it came home to me how stoical that last version of Jeanie was, how brave. When she was initially diagnosed in , she had struggled to deal with it. But when it ed in  she refused to give into despair. All she wanted, she said, was to see the end of Game of Thrones. She managed that at least.The thing is she wouldnrsquot want you to know any of this. Jeanie was intensely private. She hated me mentioning her in anything I wrote. And this illness. Well, this was her business. But I guess itrsquos my business now. And what is this business  That Irsquom not sure I know. I do know that over and above losing her Ihave somehow also lost my own sense of self. I was so synced to Jeanie that I am now unfixed, ungrounded. What Irsquove realised in this no time eternity that Irsquom currently living in, is I donrsquot really know what Irsquom for any more.I am still a father and a son and a brother and brother-in-law and a friend . But I navigated through the world with Jean as my lodestar. And now that star has disappeared, and the night is dark.I donrsquot believe in heaven but I have taken to thinking about the possibility of parallel universes. I like the idea that somewhere there is another Jeanie even now. In most of them I guess she would never have met me. Or maybe she met me and didnrsquot like me, or vice versa . But I want to believe she is out there. Somewhere, I hope, Jeanie is smoking a cigarette and enjoying it as much as she does in our wedding video.In the week after Jeanrsquos death we put a notice in the Falkirk Herald. The Philip Larkin line from his poem An Arundel Tomb seemed appropriate: ldquoWhat will survive of us is love. It comes at the end of a poem in which Larkin is trying to suggest otherwise. But I want it to be true.Yesterday would have been your birthday, Jeanie. What survives of you is love. Thatrsquos why this hurts so much.

impressions show a widened high street bustling with le, outlining how the area could look in ten yearsrsquo time ndash albeit with an optimistic view of Scottish weather.Suggestions for the townrsquos revamp include repurposing the Paisley Centre shopping hub into a new residential quarter with ground-floor retail, as well as introducing a European-style food hall housing independent bars and eateries.Public spaces for outdoor activity could also be introduced, alongside lanes and streets creating new views and routes to lsquohiddenrsquo parts of the town centre.Meanwhile, vacant historic buildings such as the Liberal Club, YMCA building and TA Building could be brought back into use, and a high street cinema opened to attract visitors.Parts of university and college campuses could also be relocated into the heart of the town centre.SNP Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said the study ldquorepresents another signicant milestone in the regeneration of Paisley and is further evidence of the ambition and commitment of the local community and partners.She said: ldquoA huge opportunity now exists to use this collaborative vision to create more positive change in the town, as well as sharing learning which can benefit other town centres and communities across Scotland.The lsquoVision for Paisley Town Centre rsquo study is the result of a unique collaboration between Renfrewshire Council, the Scottish Government and Scotlandrsquos Town Partnership, and uses Paisley as a test case for a series of bold ideas which could also be implemented where.It aims to build on the momentum created by the townrsquos unsuccessful bid to become UK City of Culture .This includes a pound million investment in its venues and outdoor spaces, including turning Paisley

Instead, it gathers dust.Then there are the campaign website names the SNP bought on the back of the Brexit referendum.You may remember the party launched a poundm fundraiser through the ref.scot website after Ms Sturgeon first announced in March  that she intended to hold Indyref.It has since fallen into disuse.The SNP also bought mobilise.scot and organise.scot as part of its push.The ownership has been allowed to lapse and both are up for sale again.Nor is there a refreshed case for independence, and time is flying by.The SNP has yet to prepare public opinion for its new position on adopting a Scottish currency as soon as practicable after independence.It has not said how it would respond to Brexit, particularly how it would handle trade and customs arrangements with Englandit was out of the EU and Scotland rejoined.ldquoIf we go into a referendum offering a hard border at Gretna wersquore f***ed, as one SNP MSP puts it.:Nicola Sturgeon: Scotland redefining what it means to be successful nationIndeed, itrsquos hard to see how anyone could offer such plans until we know what Brexit looks like - after the UK-EU trade talks this year.Then there is White Paper .It was reported yesterday that Ms Sturgeonrsquos officials continue to revise the slab-like prospectus of  to ensure Scots can make ldquoan informed choice over the future of our country.The Tories were duly outraged at this, given Mr Johnsonrsquos rejection of referendum powers for Holyrood.I was not at all outraged. As independence is the governmentrsquos avowed policy, it is natural for it to task civil servants with developing that policy. But where is it The original White Paper was published almost  days before the  referendum to give voters time to study its  pages.As Ms Sturgeon holds up that referendum as the ldquogold standard template for the next one, it would seem White Paper  is already late.Agreed, there are  days left in . But December and November arenrsquot candidates for Indyref because of Christmas and the massive COP climate conference in Glasgow draining police resources.The last practical date would be October, and that means there is already less time to study any new White Paper than last time.Yet the Scottish Government said only this week, in response to a freedom of information request, that it would be updating the White Paper ldquoover the next few months.Soit ever does emerge, there may be only half the time of  to come to ldquoan informed choice, plus it would be full of holes about Brexit.It would hardly be an advert for efficient, joyous government outside the Union - and thatrsquos before the stooshie about the bill for printing it and getting it to every household.Ms Sturgeon would be accused of taunting taxpayers with their own cash, sending them a non-prospectus for a non-referendum.The First Minister is a formidable politician. Her opponents may criticise her record and goals, but they respect and envy her ability.They would not characterise her as slapdash or unprofessional.Butshe were to blow millions on a rush-job White Paper without a legal referendum in sight, or play to impatient Yessers by attempting a hillbilly referendum of her own, that respect would be lost overnight.She would be damned as cavalier, a loose cannon not to be trusted with devolution far less independence.Ms Sturgeon wonrsquot like it, but her choice is between retreat now with dignity or retreat later without it."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10944130.jpg?type=article-full","title":"volunteers-needed-build-17th-century-house-glencoe","story":"The National Trust for Scotlandis offering those with an interest in the past an opportunity to build a replica house fit for a th-century crofter ndash complete with turf roof and wattle and daub walls.The project is part of a push to explore the story of Glen Coe and find the ldquolost villages which vanished from the map in the aftermath of the infamous massacre of .Volunteers will help create the type of dwelling used by the glenrsquos inhabitants on the eve of the attack by government soldiers, which led to the deaths of around  men, women and children.Many of the buildings were put to the torch while livestock were driven off, and settlements which had stood for centuries disappeared from the map.Now a new ldquoturfhouse, which would have been familiar to those departed villagers, will rise again in the grounds of the Glencoe Visitor Centre, which reopened last year after a major refurbishment.Glencoe Operations Manager Emily BryceGlencoe Operations Manager Emily Bryce said: ldquoItrsquos nearly a year since we revamped our Glencoe visitor centre and this project, with the support of public donations, is our next step in sharing the story of this incredible landscape which we are so proud to protect.ldquoItrsquos very exciting that wersquoll be able to involve the public and visitors in such a hands-on way. Wersquoll also be working with our local community and schools too, and are keen to make sure that the whole area benefits from this project.Glen Coe was the scene of one of the clan erarsquos most notorious episodes in Scottish history, when the British state conspired with local chiefs to attack the MacDonald clan who called the glen their home over their failure to pledge allegiance to King William III in time.Soldiers from the Earl of Argyllrsquos regiment, who had been staying in the glen and enjoying the famous Highland hospitality of its inhabitants, suddenly turned on their hosts on the morning of February , .Dozens were slaughtered while many more were driven over the bleak hills in the dead of winter, where they died from exposure as they fled ill-clothed and unprepared.In the years that followed the area was largely given over to sheep farming, with the remaining inhabitants forced to move where.The Trust has been investigating three villages which were abandoned during that time ndash Inverigan, Achnacon and Achtriochtan ndash and the reconstructed turfhouse will be used to highlight the way their inhabitants lived, more than  years ago.Archaeologists have been excavating in GlencoeHolidaymakers who help build the structure will get the chance to work in a wide iety of tasks, including whittling wooden pegs to weaving wattle walls, archaeological excavations and mud daubing.To oversee the project, NTS has recruited a team with vast experience in traditional building methods, while archaeologists who have explored the area will work on the buildingrsquos design.These specialists in turf-building, heather thatching, wattle and daub, timber creel and cruck frame structures will lead trainees and volunteers over the course of the year in the unique experiment in historical reconstruction.The project is being made possible thanks to members of the public from around the world who donated to a fundraising appeal last year.In  the conservation charity that protects Scotlandrsquos national and natural treasures invested over poundm in Glencoe Visitor Centre, transforming the existing eco-friendly buildings into a more modern, immersive and welcoming ldquogateway to the world-renowned glen.The visitor centre has a  seat film screening space showing a specially-commissioned film which takes viewers on a -minute journey from the glenrsquos volcanic origins and its tragic past, while also examining its enduring popularity with tourists and outdoor enthusiasts.A large D map and an Info Hub was also installed to help visitors plan their adventures and share advice on how to explore the area responsibly.The Glencoe Visitor Centre also plays an essential part in generating income to support the NTSrsquos conservation work in Glencoe National Nature Reserve, where it oversees the protection of more than , acres of wilderness, including km of footpaths and eight Munros."},{"url":null,"title":"fidelma-cook-got-english-casual-arrogant-ignorance","story":"She doubted many things in her ordinary, extraordinary le her middle years spent in England like many of her country women but she never doubted her right to live in a free Ireland.Born into a Republican family she was reared on the injustices meted out to her poor country as her own le weathered servitude, poverty, sickness and all the tragedies that make up a personal history.At the same time, Irsquom reading Victoria Hisloprsquos lsquoThose Who Are Loved,rsquo a family saga set against the backdrop of wartime occupation in Greece and the subsequent civil war.The two books couldnrsquot be more dferent in setting and pace and yet so alike in the fierceness of the determination of the two central women to set their countries free.One grew up in the Irish Free State, where homes were still ided in the bitter aftermath of the civil war, and the country lanes were dotted with hand spun memorials to the fallen and the murdered.The other fought with the Communists against foes who were once allies, and at warrsquos end, like so many, was tracked down, captured, re-educated by torture ndash by her own people whorsquod learned well at the hands of the fascists.One book a biography, the other a novel. One woman real, the other a beautully drawn imaginary portrait.Laying down the books what stayed with me was the essence, the spirit of both, and the feeling that one had grasped the mood of both countries.I know one country well, the other not at all. I know France well, or so I think, and certainly have grasped both history and mood all the more for living here.When I write about two of the three countries mentioned, I do so with the confidence of close contact of stories told and remembered of links forged republic to republic.I do the same with England and Scotland although I havenrsquot set foot in either for years. But I lived and worked in both. I switched listening modes from London to Glasgow as easily as switching TV channels and in Scotland reported on and witnessed a country rapidly evolving, gathering within it a fresh pride, a steely core to rid itself of dependence on Westminster. A desire ndash long before the words were so grotesquely appropriated by the Brexiters ndash to take back control.I lsquogotrsquo it. And I lsquogotrsquo the English too in their casual, arrogant ignorance and lack of interest in anything other than them.I got it having grown up in a country which also was powering towards a new destiny remembering the past but not in thrall to it looking forward to Europe and not back to the chains of an inglorious Empire.So, when I comment, I comment from a little knowledge, from a tapping in to, not just the history, but the spirit.It is why I am constantly surprised by commentators who pronounce on Scotland, on referendums and on the Party, which is the driving force for Independence.Many words are expended on reasons why that should not be, using suspect financial lsquofactsrsquo and endless repetition of half, long negated arguments that research would have knocked down immediately.Some of the arguments against Scotland leaving the Union are well-reasoned and well worth consideration but these too are knocked down by the lamentable chippiness of some who are as blind as the commentators they dismiss.Itrsquos a word blindness activated by what is seen as a malevolent force robbing and battering the Scots from time immemorial. That is not the truth but there is a truth contained within it.What irritates me above all in most of these comment pieces coming from over the Border, is absence, awareness. Absence of any attempt to delve under the demands to seek the almost indefinable ndash the spirit of a people.Any reading of history shows that movements grow slowly until suddenly, like a high tide, they gather and form until the point they are unstoppable.Sometimes though the expected tide doesnrsquot reach its watermark and flops against the bulwarks ndash becalmed, almost shocked at its sudden halt.If not careful, the Independence movement could reach that point and make no mistake, nothing is being spared by the Westminster Opposition to ensure it does.Confidence can be chipped away statistics twisted to enable doubt to take seed groups encouraged to agitate from within with public spats that only increase the nervousness of those unsure and uncertainthey want to leave the familiar.Cynicism in these times is good ndash but not too much. Passion is good ndash but must be controlled. Anger is good ndash but swallow pride and turn it outwards not back into the group.Much is made of Irelandrsquos struggle for independence and its success on the European stage. Some believe a whole nation rose up. In fact, the Easter rising was begun by a handful, ridiculed by Dubliners as they marched to the Four Courts.Captured, they could have gone down as yet another minor episode. But the British made a mistake and murdered them in Kilmainham Gaol, creating heroes and firing up the land.The British always make a mistake because they never understand the soul of a country.Patience."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-bawdy-beautiful","story":"IT being Burns Night this evening, we would be remisswe didnrsquot celebrate the bonnie, bawdy Bard of Ayrshire on this page.

The guest was feeling queasy because of the slight swell, although a recent dalliance with the drink couldnrsquot be ruled out as a factor.As he was watching the lobster fishermen at work, said chap was overcome and was sick over the side, losing his  teeth in the process. This caused much hilarity among the crew, who decided to prolong the fun.They borrowed the skipperrsquos  teeth and placed them in a creel as it was brought on deck. What a miracle, they explained. What a chance in a million for the sea to yield up the dentures which had been so cruelly lost. The victim of their hoax was quite amazed and put in the said  teeth. But they remained in his mouth only a few seconds. ldquoAch, these arenrsquot my teeth, he grumbled as he pulled out the skipperrsquos dentures and tossed them into the sea.Dodgy docLIKE Burns, Chic Murray was a genius of a very Scottish sort, whose material was sometimes a smidgen saucy.

Those who can harness it quickly discover that it can be turned into sharp profit without meddlesome factors like human labour, factory costs and a care for the environment. This has transformed the act of placing a bet on a sporting outcome.:Brian Rice case highlight how approach to gambling in Scottish football has to be revisitedPreviously, the issues associated with addiction and problem gambling were unintended and unsought. Irsquom not saying here you could ever have characterised this industry by its empathy for the flawed human condition. Once, there had been a degree of humanity though, where checks and balances might be provided simply by visiting a bookmakers and interacting with friends and neighbours.Now, billions are spent by the online gambling industry to ensure that addiction isnrsquot an unfortunate consequence but a desired outcome. And professional football, the most popular sport in the world, is where the lowest-hanging fruit is to be found.This week, Brian Rice, the respected manager of Hamilton Academical FC, became the latest high-profile football person to admit that he has been struggling with gambling addiction for most of his adult le.His story is only the latest in a long litany of human tragedies associated with football and gambling.Almost immediately the football tribe ndash managers, players and journalists ndash threw a protective cordon around him and praised Mr Rice for his dignity and courage in going public with his ordeal. Predictably, they strove to absolve the football authorities and our major clubs from any blame that might have attached to them owing to their lucrative association with online gambling.Some of their arguments were reasonable.After all, much of the sponsorship cash can be spent on developing young players and supporting nearby health and wellbeing initiatives in local communities.This though, is a bit like saying thatyou swim with sharks it can give you a greaterappreciation of their natural environment.  There is a reason why the predatory giants of the online gambling industry have targeted professional football. In no other sphere of human endeavour do so many working-class people gather in such huge numbers at regular intervals.According to recently reported research the industry is using third-party companies to collect personal data and thus enable online casinos to target low-income customers and ex-gamblers. One former digital marketing specialist in the industry said: ldquoThird-party data providers allowed us to target their email lists with precision. Lower-income users were among the most successfully targeted segments.The eye-watering profits accruing from gambling allow operators to use every artice and lever at their disposal to ensure they are ring-fenced. In the House of Commons several MPs recently sought to defend fixed-odds betting machines , the so-called ldquocrack cocaine of gambling in the face of Government proposals to limit them. These politicians were later revealed to have received expensive gts and hospitality from the betting industry.:Neil Cameron: Brian Rice case nothing to do with hypocrisySo vast and pernicious is the influence of the gambling lobby that in , the former Sports Minister, Tracey Crouch, was forced to admit defeat. She resigned after the government refused to back down on the timetable for reducing the maximum stake on FOBMs. She had wanted the change to be made earlier than the planned date of October . Yet senior colleagues ignored her even when she said that the delay could lead to hundreds of people killing themselves because of gambling addiction linked to these machines.Ms Crouch wasnrsquot indulging in emotional hyperbole here. In , research published in the journal Neuron, found that gambling makes people susceptible to depression and anxiety by altering the brainrsquos physical structure. Previous research had consistently found links associating gambling with debt, family breakdown and a suite of mental health issues.The new research though, found thatthese affective disorders diminish the capacity to tolerate economic risk.The online behemoths prey on menwhen they are at their most vulnerable. This is when they are watching live football and drinking.Their smartphone devices are weaponised by the online companies to extract as much money as possible from them in the two-hour window available to them.Odds are offered on every twist and turn of the action by a bewildering array of online products that bookend the televised pictures and analysis. The Gambling Commission recently fined a major online firm poundm after it missed more than  incidents indicating behaviour associated with a problem gambler. On one occasion the gambler immediately re-staked substantial winnings, suggesting this was either a money-laundering operation or an affluent addict. Yet this occurs much more often further down the financial scale but escapes scrutiny owing to the smaller sums.The football authorities which solicit these firms and the clubs who prostitute themselves to them are just as culpable in spreading the disease of gambling addiction. They are knowingly giving licence to these companies to destroy the lives of their most vulnerable and disadvantaged supporters.My own team, Celtic, have won more trophies than I could ever have hoped for during my letime. Yet I would gladly trade all of them to redeem the le of one person and their family ruined by addiction to gambling. And I would beseech Celtic and all other clubs who permit their colours to be contaminated by the logos of these online jackals to be rid of them and to work harder to attract more ethical and less-lethal sponsorship."},{"url":null,"title":"first-time-buyer-numbers-almost-double-decade-scotland","story":"Figures from the Bank of Scotland show, people entered the property market in  compared to, in  ndash an increase of more than %.First-time buyers account for % of all housing purchases with a mortgage in Scotland, up from % in .Ricky Diggins, operations director at Bank of Scotland, said: ldquoWersquove seen a big uplt in the number of first-time buyers in Scotland over the last decade and they continue to account for around half of all purchases.:New poundm loan scheme for first-time buyersldquoThis shows just how important they are to the health of the Scottish property market, a situation thatrsquos been helped by a number of factors including Government schemes and continued low interest rates.ldquoScotland also remains one of the most affordable areas in the whole of the UK, with both average prices and deposits much lower than the overall average across the four nations.He added: ldquoThat only tells part of the story though, with signicant dferences seen in many local areas, and locations such as Edinburgh and East Lothian looking more challenging for those aiming to take that first step onto the property ladder.The cost of a typical first home went up by % ndash pound, ndash in Scotland over the last  years, from pound, in  to pound, in .Meanwhile, the average deposit put down by a first-time buyer increased by % over the same period, from pound, to pound,.:Scottish first-time buyer numbers more than double in a decadeFrom  to , the typical price paid by a first-time buyer in Scotland rose by % , while the average deposit was up by % .Scotland remains one of the most affordable places in the UK to buy a first property, with only Northern Ireland at pound, and the north of England at pound, recording a lower average price for first-time buyers in .This compares to a UK average first-time buyer price of pound,, while the average UK deposit last year for first-time buyers was pound,."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-city-council-write-prime-minister-scottish-independence","story":"The invitation was made during a debate on Scottish Independence at Thursdays full council meeting.During the discussion  councillors agreed that the local authority would write to Boris Johnson to demand that it should be up to the Scottish Government to determine another referendum.Councillor Susan Aitken also accused the Conservatives of taking on the role of a pantomime villain during the debate.:Tom Gordon: Nicola Sturgeonrsquos lsquonext stepsrsquo put her judgment on the lineLabour and Tory councillors argued that a \"once in a letime vote\" meant that and not every seven years and that the SNP should \"get back to the day job\".Councillor Euan Blockley said: \"I am not only upset and angry having to debate this in this chamber - thats  minutes of my le that Im not going to get back - but there are so many more things that this council should be focussing on.\"We have an education system in this country that is in a dire state of affairs.

Rationing also generated thousands of enquiries, and bureaux persuaded the government to grant extra clothes coupons to pregnant women. The first CABs in  were in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Stirling and Dundee.Post-war period: Against expectations, the end of the war brought an increased demand. CABs dealt with more enquiries than at the height of the blitz. Housing problems and family breakdowns increased. To meet this demand, the number of CABs began to prolerate.The advent of Legal Aid and the NHS led to a surge in enquiries.s: Housing problems continued to grow as people struggled with the housing shortage, overcrowding, and the end of rent controls.Hire purchase promised le on the ‘never-never.’ For many this led to mounting debts.s: Rents were rocketing, yet many people were still living in slum conditions and homelessness was rising. By  housing problems accounted for a quarter of the . million problems dealt with by CABs across the UK.Divorce reform too led to a surge in enquiries, with family problems representing  per cent of the CAB workload.s: Family, housing and benefit problems remained the top priority, but the consumer boom saw personal debt soar too. Industrial change saw an increase in redundancies and workers’ rights issues.s: Consumerism brought with it two recessions and debt and benefit cases doubled. Employment enquiries rose by  per cent. But debt, stemming from easy credit, became the biggest CAB issue.s: Social security became the top issue and sharp rises in VAT didn’t help. Repossessions and homelessness increased.-: Payday loans, combined with a lack of affordable housing, caused unprecedented levels of debt. Welfare reform left many families in debt, with Universal Credit generating enormous numbers of enquiries."},{"url":null,"title":"good turnout for wildlife group event","story":"About  people attended the first meeting of the Bailies of Bennachie Wildle group recently.

In January last year, we featured his incredible aim to run  ultramarathons along some of Scotland’s ancient pilgrim routes.The Running Home  challenge combined his two passions – running and his work with charity Embrace the Middle East, for which he is regional manager for Scotland and the north of England.He hoped to raise £, to rebuild war-torn areas of Iraq while covering the  miles, gathering support and funds along the way.While there were times when Mark didn’t think he’d see the finish line, he successfully completed the challenge.He also surpassed his fundraising tally – with £, currently banked.And he’s hopeful that even more funds will be amassed before he travels to Iraq this spring to see it put to good use.Marksaid: “There were occasions when I wanted to go home.“I knew,I was to quit, I was going home to a nice, comfortable house. The people I was running for don’t have that option.“That was a monumental reason to keep going.”Mark had extraordinary support along the way, not least from his crew – Gareth Brocklebank and Andrew Clarke – who followed him in a camper van, which also acted as shelter in areas where overnight BB stays were not an option.Mark’s we Karen and his two daughters also cheered him every step of the way as did many strangers.“People welcomed me into their churches and communities and generously donated large sums of money,” he said.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.hawick-news webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Hands-on...Superintendent Sharon Comriehas worked for the SSPCA for an incredible  years.

I was feeling great but, within ten minutes, a niggle turned into barely being able to walk.“I had to find a couple of sticks from the woods to use as shin splints.”However, it was an earlier, shorter run – St Cuthbert’s in March – which cost Mark a full day and also taught him a very valuable lesson.“I wanted to run from Melrose to Lindisfarne, where I planned to stay overnight, but I had to be there for a certain time due to the tide restrictions.“I got lost early on and was chasing my tail for the rest of the day. I started pushing really hard and ended up lost in the hills for  minutes, with no water, torchlight or phone charge.“I rushed checkpoints and didn’t take the time to check my kit properly.“I was dehydrated, didn’t stay on Lindisfarne and lost a whole day because of it.“It taught me a very good lesson – that I couldn’t do it alone and that these runs were pilgrimages, not races.“I had my tail between my legs the next couple of days but the reception at Durham Cathedral reminded me of what I was doing and why.”Mark enjoyed a similar reception at the Forth Bridges, where supporters and family joined forces to cheer him on before he reached the finish line in St Andrews on November .The following day, he addressed parishioners in St Leonard’s Church.It was the perfect place to end Running Home as St Andrews was once such a centre of pilgrimage.Mark took a breather to enjoy Christmas and New Year but has a busy  planned.He added: “I’m heading to Iraq in the spring to see how the money is being spent.“I also plan to revisit some of the places and people I met this year, by car though!“I passed through a lot of villages that were torched in the Highland Clearances.“People were forced out of their homes, and in some cases country, so there’s a sense of solidarity there with today’s refugees.“I was conscious of not being able to spend much time in places where I got a great deal of support.“So I’m hoping to revisit some of those communities, combining storytelling and traditional folk music to consolidate the friendships I made this year.”Karen is not keen for Mark to pull his running shoes back on too soon, but he will be taking on the York Marathon in October.

I was surrounded by a phenomenal group of kind and supportive people from all walks of le who had me laughing through every mental and physical challenge the wall had to give us. The views are so breath-taking no photo can do it justice, the challenge pushed me past my limits and rewarded me in ways I never expected.“I learned so much about the Chinese culture and had the adventure of a letime. I made the most amazing memories and I cannot recommend it enough to anyone , I will cherish every moment for the rest of my le and feel privileged to have been had this experience and to have raised funds and awareness for CLAN at the same time.”CLAN head of income generation and business development Fiona Fernie commented: “We are so grateful to everyone who undertakes challenges to raise money for CLAN.“We never underestimate how hard people work to raise money for CLAN and it is rewarding to hear when our supporters have had really positive experiences doing so. CLAN receives no statutory money from government bodies, and our services are completely funded by the work we and our supporters do.“In , we saw a % increase in the number of people who came to us for support, and so we need even more people to join us in fundraising.“The group that went to China in October had the adventure of a letime and the money they raised will go towards providing wellbeing support and services for people affected by cancer across the north-east.“Taking part in a challenge such as the Great Wall of China can be daunting so we are delighted to welcome the team from Global Adventures and some of ’s participants who I know will share their enthusiasm and help build excitement for the  trek.”For more information please contact fundraising@clanhouse.org or visit the CLAN website.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Ellon Primary School pupils with the cooking team and their special guests at the kitchen opening event\"  School celebrates new kitchen viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"traffic","story":"ScotRail has launched a new campaign encouraging people to stop and think about their own personal safety while travelling or at work.

While the Government continues to dither, local people will feel the impact as we move from being rule makers to rule takers.“Last week I spoke in the house about the risks that new tarfs and trade barriers could have for businesses in the Northern Isles. Food and drink production are a staple part of the isles economy. The impact that continued and intensied tarfs could have on rural communities is signicant and organisations such as the SWA are understandably concerned.“This could be just a taste of what is to come as we leave the EU and our economic clout is reduced. If there were any doubt about the limits of our leverage in future trade negotiations with the US, this is a reminder of the precarious position that the Government is putting us in.“I will be writing to the Secretary of State for International Trade to explain what efforts they are making on these tarfs as a matter of urgency. With the UK losing our seat at the table in these trade talks at the end of this month, the next two weeks are crucial. We must give a voice to our local producers in these trade talks while we still can.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While HIAL has gone through the motions of consulting, having clearly failed to take on board any of the concerns raised, it is dficult to see what purpose this has served.“Since the announcement last week, I have been in discussions with local ATC staff who feel badly let down by HIAL.  Nobody disputes the need for modernisation, but even HIAL’s own consultants concluded that the remote tower model was the most costly and risky option. Alternatives were identied that could have delivered the improvements needed at a fraction of the cost.“While I welcome that HIAL is to carry out an island impact assessment, given its approach to consultation so far, there have to be questions over how robust or independent this assessment will be.#In the meantime, ministers must wake up to the scale of opposition and dissatisfaction amongst HIAL’s ATC staff. They should also recognise the clear threat this poses to delivery of leline air services in Orkney and across the Highlands  Islandsstaff choose to vote with their feet. That alone should give Ministers pause for thought and allow more time for alternative options to be explored”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The cap only affects concerts and other major events which close off all or part of the park to non ticket-holders during normal opening hours.The business plan, which is due to be discussed by councillors next week, would effectively give the green light for major events like the Summer Sessions pop and rock concerts, the Fly Open Air dance music festival, the cityrsquos festival fireworks finale and the Hogmanay concert in the gardens to continue.The proposed limit on events which restrict public access to the gardens is three times the size of a previous official cap, which has been in place for years. It was effectively relaxed when the council decided to treat an extended series of concerts as one event.The business case also raises the prospect of new medium-sized events being staged in the gardens, such as the ldquoSummer Nights events held in Kelvingrove Park in Glasgow. It is thought there would also be flexibility to accommodate large-scale one-off events involving the likes of the BBC, MTV or the Tour de France.The overall vision for the project, which has been in the planning for five years, is to \"create and sustain a space for all in the heart of the city, celebrating nature, reflection, community and performance.\"Income from all-ticket events would help subsidise the staging of smaller-scale events in the gardens, such as a Pride event, cinema screenings, showcases for buskers, school prom events and light shows.Other new events could include theatre productions, traditional arts and culture events, live music performances, spoken word events and family activities. Under the vision for the future of the park, which dates back to the mid-th century, ldquoevery Edinburgh citizen and visitor to the city will have experienced West Princes Street Gardens and the Quaich Project. Community groups would only pay a nominal fee, which could be as low as £, for the use of the gardens for their events under the new financial model, with the city council handling bookings from event organisers and promoters.It is hoped up to £, a year could be generated from the hiring out of the gardens for events and income from the new two-storey ldquogateway centre, although running costs for the new-look gardens are estimated to come to up to £, in future.The Quaich Project, a public private partnership being pursued by the city council and a trust set up by Apex Hotels founder and former Edinburgh Playhouse owner Norman Springford, would see the run-down Ross Bandstand, which opened in , replaced by a ldquoHobbit House-style pavilion for performances and an amphitheatre instead of the existing concrete bowl.A two-storey complex featuring a visitor centre, cafe and corporate hospitality facilities would offer direct access from Princes Street and boast spectacular views of events below Edinburgh Castle. The business plan has been published ahead of detailed designs for the revamp of the park being submitted to the council in the spring. A key aim is to deliver ldquoa balanced programme of activities ranging from small scale community events  learning programmes to festivals and major events throughout the year, befitting a capital city, world class visitor destination and much-loved public lsquogarden.rsquoIt states: ldquoWe will curate the use of spaces and activities throughout West Princes Street Gardens to enable a primary focus on community events which reflect the nature of the spaces involved.\"These include school and family events, lectures and talks, garden and nature tours, traditional art and culture, live music and theatre, heritage and historical programmes. The new facility will be offered at low cost for community groups and schools.ldquoWe will also procure and programme a specic number of major events which will provide high profile and high-income streams to create the affordability to community groups.ldquoWe will promote and market the project to a wide range of community bodies, schools and colleges, event and festival organisers to ensure that a healthy balance exists to enable an active yet tranquil and accessible space across the year.It is hoped that the impact of the Quaich Project will help the west end of the city withstand the impact of the new St James development, which is due to open later this year. Work is also due to be finished within months on a new Johnnie Walker visitor centre in the former House of Fraser department store, while there are plans to turn the former Royal Overseas league building opposite the bandstand into a hotel.The blueprint states: ldquoSitting in the heart of Scotlandrsquos capital, the Quaich Project offers a unique  for promoting a wide iety of activity in a spectacular setting, underpinned by a core aim of providing a mix of events and activities that fulfil our mission.ldquoIt also offers a catalyst for the re-imagining of Princes Street and its environs. With the opening of the new St James Centre and the refocusing of retail activity to the eastern end of the city centre, the project has the potential to drive the context of the area ndash cultural, social, wellbeing and environmental themes dominating a space currently occupied by buses and shops.In his report for next weekrsquos culture committee, place director Paul Lawrence states: ldquoThe completion of the refurbishment and development of West Princes Street Gardens in general, and the redevelopment of the Ross Pavilion and the construction of the associated gateway building in particular, is to the benefit of residents, visitors, event organisers and festivals, and Edinburghrsquos reputation.Donald Wilson, the city councilrsquos culture chief, said: ldquoThis is a very important stage in the project to reimagine West Princes Street Gardens.ldquoThe core focus for the business model is on community access and activity by creating and sustaining a space for all in the heart of the city, celebrating nature, reflection, community and performance.ldquoThis is a model where big events that involve exclusive access to the gardens are kept to a minimum, but these will make it possible to offer low cost rental of spaces to community or charitable organisations. Crucially, it proposes no more event days than we have at present.ldquoWest Princes Street Gardens are open almost every day of the year, with early closure for events, mainly in the evenings, amounting to less than % of normal opening times. It is estimated that within the new operating model this would continue.ldquoThe proposed new access route behind the pavilion is estimated to reduce event set up and takedown times by at least  per cent, thus reducing the impact on the gardens.David Ellis, managing director of the Quaich Project, said: ldquoOur vision is to improve the entirety of the gardens with a focus on making them a more enjoyable and accessible place for the benefit of Edinburgh residents and visitors all year round. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nafc pair shortlisted in national lantra finals ","story":"Valentina Romano and Jimmy Dakin are in the running for the Lantra Scotland awards.Jimmy Dakin from Sanday in Orkney has been shortlisted as Aquaculture Learner of the Year.

It is understood that several councils have already received registrations.While the Mid and East Antrim council meeting was held in private, the News Letter understands that some members were strongly opposed to accepting a policy which would compel staff to carry out same sex marriages against their wishes.Alderman Paul Reid, pictured, who is also a church minister in Larne, said: “I can’t go into the specics of the meeting or the discussions that took place in closed council.“However, speaking generally this is an issue affecting the whole of Northern Ireland and each of our  council areas. This has everything to do with same-sex marriage, and at the same time nothing to do with same-sex marriage.“This is an issue of conscience. Just because legal advice says something is ok, doesn’t mean it is right for councils to enforce on staff. Religious beliefs don’t come into it.“While the General Registrars’ Office believes there to be no issue legally, it is absolutely wrong to force people to carry out duties which are at odds with their conscience.”Because couples have to indicate their intention to marry  days before doing so, the first same sex weddings are expected to be held next month.Last year MPs backed amendments which required the government to extend same-sex marriage here.Paisley sees vote dip but he keeps vice-like grip on North Antrim Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":null,"title":"traffic returning to normal after ballyclare collision","story":"Road users are advised that an earlier road traffic collision in the Tildarg area has now been cleared.A Department for Infrastructure spokesperson said: “An earlier road traffic collision on the B Collin Road in the Tildarg area of Ballyclare has now been cleared and traffic is getting back to normal.”Police are at the scene.Drugs and cash seized after three vehicle collision - PSNI also raid drivers home Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2691691.jpg--.jpg?1579168441000\n","title":"good health matters and christmas cheer at glarryford wi","story":"PRESIDENT Vera McBurney welcomed speaker Robert Dick to the November meeting in Glarryford Farmers’ Hall.

He is in thehot seat this week, speaking to us about his love of music and choosing his top ten tracks - not an easy task by any means.Vincent enjoys a busy family le AND has five children and five grandchildren.He is a finance and property expert, and in his spare time helps out as a quiz master, which keeps him sharp!However music has always been a big part of his le, and he has had an interest in it since he was only a boy.“Music is a passion and something that has followed me since childhood,” explained Vincent.He confesses that his top  favourite songs are constantly changing, so when revealing his list, he decided to focus on a top  that brings back the strongest memories for him throughout his le.At number one is the Beach Boys with ‘God Only knows’.“This was released in  off the incredible Pet Sounds album. “Although I didn’t discover it until my teens, this is an enduring song of beauty.” Number two on his list is ‘The Long and Winding Road’ from The Beatles.He said: “It’s impossible not to have a Beatles track in here. This is just before my time but this song from the  ‘Let it Be’ album is my pick from many contenders.Number three is Love Affair – Everlasting Love. “This is my earliest memory from the  pop classic. “The remake of a ‘ hit for Robert Knight sung by the wonderful Steve Ellis.” The number four spot is reserved for ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’.“Coming up to its th anniversary, my constant favourite song of all time by Simon and Garfunkelis Bridge Over Troubled Waters.” Number five goes to Sam Cooke with ‘Bring it On Home to Me’“What top  couldn’t contain this amazing singer and composer who contributed to the success of Aretha, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Al Green.” Number six belongs to a Pink Floyd classic.“Probably in the mid ’s my favourite group was Pink Floyd. It was during this period that I began to collect albums.“Dark Side Of The Moon being my first Floyd purchase, however my pick is ‘Wish You Were Here’ off their ‘ album of the same name.”Seventh spot goes to The Eagles. “Sticking my mid ’s periodof music and my infatuation with The Eagles.“I rather quickly acquired their early albums ‘Desperado On The Border One Of These Nights’, however my selection is ‘The Last Resort’ off their th studio album Hotel Calornia.” For eighth spot, Vincent stays with The Eagles.“I’m still in my teenage years and sticking with the Eagles theme, although I’ve moved sideways to select an album I listened to nightly for a couple of years from Jackson Browne.“It was his fourth album and I’ve picked the title track, which is the wonderful ‘The Pretender’. As the list draws to a close, Vincent says: “Running out of room as I juggle with The Four Tops, The Jam, Steely Dan, Stevie, Wonder, Elvis Costello, Al Green, Spencer Davis, The Rolling Stones, George Harrison and OMD.“But I have to stick with my memory theme and at number nine I’ve gone with ‘Supertramp’ which I overplayed at university.“Mainly Crime Of The Century and Breakfast In America and Crisis What Crisis.“My selection is from the latter album and I’ve gone for A Soap Box Opera, it’s orchestral feel just does it to me.”For the last place on his top ten list, Vincent has included a track from the legendary Bruce Springsteen.“I needed Bruce Springsteen in here.“Although how do I pick just one track  Born To Run, The River Nebraska, Born In The USA, The Rising “Again sticking with nostalgia and being a romantic I’ve picked the  ‘Dancing In The Dark’ because it was the year I married Catherine and she’s had to put up with my music ever since!”It’s often hard to think of your favourite  tracks! Vincent admits these “are not necessarily my favourite ever songs as the list changes constantly, but they certainly contain my strongest and fondest memories from down through the years.

While he still enjoys the banter over the counter on a daily basis, hes made himself a local social media personality with his popular posts ranging from the daily headlines to his chatter sparking reminiscences about the confectionery of yesteryear. Editor Des Blackadder sat down with Eugene this week to hear just some of the stories he has to tell after four decades in his Broughshane Street shop.You could say that Eugene Diamond got his start in the newspaper industry and hes been associated with it for most of his adult le.Born in the late s in a long demolished row of mill workers cottages in James Street in Harryville, Eugene is one of nine children - three girls and six boys. Which must have been a tight fit in the James Street days.I was a baby when the family got a move to the houses in the Demesne Estate, just across the Braid River from Harryville. If you ask me I would say it was perfect place to grow up .. we had the ruins of a castle literally at the top of our estate and a forest pretty much on our doorstep!The neighbours were great people and there were lots of children growing up in the Demesne at the time. We used to have great fun making huts up in the woods - which we called the forest - just beside the old Intermediate School site. One of my best memories is making a hut under the pedestrian bridge over the Braid which led to the Ballykeel One estate - we could hear the people walking across above our heads and we thought we were some boys because they didnt know we were there! Innocent days indeed, laughs Eugene.There was no easy pocket money in those days so Eugene had to earn his by delivering newspapers around the sprawling Ballykeel Two estate which had been constructed in the late s.That was my first job in the newspaper business, recalls Eugene. I got the job with the late Tam Johnston who had premises at what used to be known as the Ballykeel One shops. He was a gentleman and his shop will be well remembered by the older generation around Ballykeel and Harryville.Having attended St Patricks High School, Eugenes first real job took him to the Murphys Bottling Plant which was sited just off Railway Street in Harryville.Always on the look out for an extra few quid, Eugene took on a weekend job serving in a clothes shop in the centre of Ballymena.That was me into the retail sector - and it was a great time to be in the clothing trade. A guy called Brian Close owned the shop which was called In-Gear. It was just at the corner of Bryan Street and Church Street - the same building occupied until recently by David Bellingham.Things went well and he offered me the post of manager so I left Murphys for good.It was an era of glam rock, outrageous stars and some outright fashion disasters.Top of the Pops more or less set the style. When the Bay City Rollers hit the heights their tartan striped half mast trousers and skinny college style jumpers were huge sellers especially with the girls.Most guys round Ballymena were pretty much content with a pair of jeans, a gingham shirt and a Shetland wool jumper. Younger lads wore a lot of Wrangler denim known locally as the Wrangler suit of jacket and skinner half mast jeans.I remember the night that David Essex appeared on Top of the Pops wearing a grandad shirt - the next day there was a huge demand for the style, we couldnt get enough of them!Bryan Ferry more or less brought the elegant suit back into fashion when he and Roxy Music made a comeback just after the punk era had faded. Guys all wanted the double-breasted suit with turn-up trousers at the time, he recalls.Eugene chuckles when I ask him about the fashion disasters he encountered.I sold an awful lot of velvet jackets at a time, he recalls. Black, blue, bottle green. They were very popular but I bet the guys who bought them wonder why when they look back.Then there was the parallel suit - I can remember the favourite colour was electric blue. Basically it was a sports coat worn with matching extra width trousers. You could have sailed the Atlantic with themyoud nailed them to a mast!But denim was, without doubt, the major seller in Ballymena and a controversial advert for one particular brand meant that Eugene found himself in the eye of a publicity storm which made headlines far and wide.In those days dferent shops were linked to a certain brand - for example Sam of Sams Boutique had what was effectively the Wrangler dealershipI remember. Edwin Maternaghan was another big name in fashion retailing locally and he had Brutus.By now the name of In-Gear had been changed to Bananas Boutique and we were selling Easy Jeans and a new product called Jesus Jeans.They had a full colour poster of a well-proportioned lady squeezed into a pair of Jesus Jeans with the slogan He who loves me, follows me. We put it up in the window and it was a marmite job - people either loved it or hated it! One religious group based out in the country started a petition about it so we started a counter petition in the shop.It was the time when Ballymena couldnt appear in a news story without the words Bible Belt being added on - around the same time you had the ELO showgrounds story making headlines too.While Eugene enjoyed the fun times at Bananas, he can well remember one of Ballymenas worst days of devastation during the troubles when Church Street was blown to smithereens by an IRA bomb.It was on Friday, May ,  and I remember I was chatting to a friend outside the shop when a police car raced up and an officer told us to clear the area because there was a bomb in a post office van parked in the street. I had got round to Wellington Street and was talking to my good friend journalist Lyle McMullan.I said to him theres a story for you and because there were so many bomb hoaxes in those days he replied onlyit goes off.With that the lower end of Church Street just lted. Ive never felt or seen anything like it before or since. It was a scene of utter devastation which people who lived through it will never forget. One of my vivid memories is how dficult it was to get re-opened - the shop had very distinctive rounded windows and it took a long time to get new glass  made by Pilkingtons. And of course a lot of people will remember the bomb damage sales which took place in the aftermath.When Bananas closed its doors in , Eugene reckoned it was time for a change of direction and when he came across a small shop for rent in Upper Broughshane Street he decided to take the plunge. It was called the First and last because it was the first shop on the way into town and, coversely, the last as you were going out!I had started off delivering papers as a wee boy and now I found myself in behind the counter of a paper shop, he said.”My first rent payment was pound a week.”Forty years later hes still loving the job - despite a horrying early .am start!Sure its only seven days a week, laughs Eugene.In those  years, Eugene has witnessed the high points of the newspaper market when titles like News of the World sold by the barrow load.You couldnt explain to todays generation just how huge the NOTW actually was. People might have bought the quality Sundays but they also bought the NOTW eventhey did tuck it inside the Sunday Times! Of course they were caught out in some abysmal practices and that cant be forgiven but they did break some enormously important stories too. I still have some NOTW publicity material on a side wall of the shop. It may well be the last such material still on display in Britain but I keep it there to remind of just how big the newspaper print industry was at the time.But selling papers was only part of Eugenes role and he was a past master at stirring up some publicity out of all proportion to the size of his tiny shop.Back in the early s I took a punt on getting my own Ballymena Rock made up by a firm in Newry. People thought I had lost the plot because everyone associated rock with seaside resorts and not a town like Ballymena. Thankfully local people loved the idea and I had a great sale on it. Quite a few bars were sent overseas too, he laughs.The ieties of sweets and chocolate bars Eugene has sold down through the years is staggering.In fact, Ive come to the conclusion that people here have the sweetest tooth in the world! If you want to start a debate in Ballymena all you have to do is ask someone what their favourite sweet of all time was.Im a diabetic so I dont do many sweets but I have a good knowledge of wnhat the public wants and to this day people will travel from all over the country to buy a certain brand of toffee or an old style boiled sweet which I stock. Sweets especially are memory jerkers and they have tremendous nostalgia value. If it gets people talking and laughing sure its a good thing. How many times have I heard stories about someone losing a filling to the old Rileys Toffee Rolls  And yet they still came back for more!And does he have a personal favourite Cinnamon Lozenges all the way, he says. As far as I know they are more or less an Irish-only sweet because people come in all the time and take away a few bags full to friends and family in other parts of the world.Talking about local flavours, Eugene says he still has regulars who come specically for the bottled minerals.You would not believe the number of people who still swear by Kali water! And the younger generation will have absolutely no idea wnat Kali Water is but older people will probably be remembering the day they took a drink of it by mistake.If digital technology is our pathway to the future then it is a time machine which works both ways and Eugenes nostalgia posts about old sweets on social media have been delighting the local public for the past few years.As one who was steeped in newspapers I was a latecomer to twitter and facebook but time waits for no man so I decided to embrace it. To be honest Ive had some great fun thanks to social media. People love the old pictures of products and just love to tell you their stories of why they loved a particular brand more than others, says Eugene.The recognition by the National Lottery reflects sales which have raised more than pound. million for good causes down through the years. As one of the last old style newsagents the award is well deserved and theextends its best wishes to Eugene as he embarks on his st year in the trade.

I want to make sure the Assembly reflects the new opportunity we have and have said to members both publicly and privately that I have to try and set a standard here of respecting everybody no matter who is in that chamber, they are all equal. The people who vote for them are equal. It’s about respect at the end of the day and I have to earn that as well.”The West Belfast MLA said that his take on the dynamics of the new ing Assembly going forward is that “it’s very important that it rises to occasion”. Having met with British Prime Minister Boris Johnston, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney, Mr Maskey said that both governments need to “respect that as well”. “We’ve got to respect political dference and we have to manage those,” he said. “I had very constructive engagements with them on Monday, obviously the substance of their visits was dealt with by the Executive.”Impartiality in his role as Speaker is a core element of the post, he said.“I had been pushing very hard on securing the funding that was announcement by the Department for Education for West Belfast schools. When it was announced about St John the Baptist I couldn’t even comment on it as I was in the ‘chair’ and that is the type of thing that your constituency needs to see a result on. There are little restrictions in this role but I will try to manage them."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"andytown ahead of schedule","story":"THE new Andersonstown Leisure Centre is set to open to the public in April, it has been revealed.Speaking at the official opening of the Brook Leisure Centre in Twinbrook, Cllr Brian Kingston, Chair of Belfast City Council’s Strategic, Policy and Resources Committee, said the redevelopment project was “ahead of schedule”.He said: “West Belfast has more to look forward to later this year with the opening of the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre, scheduled to open in April.“Herron Brotherstold me they are ahead of schedule.“Both Brook and Andersonstown Leisure Centres will completely transform leisure opportunities and active living access in West Belfast.”The new £ million state-of-the-art facility on the Andersonstown Road will focus largely on water-based family fun, with the newly installed water slides having been visible for months.The centre will also offer a range of dry facilities including a -station fitness suite, exercise and spin studio, café, multi-purpose room and two outdoor G five-a-side pitches."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"best of traditional irish music for belfast","story":"THE Waterfront Hall is set to host the  Gradam Ceoil TG music awards, with globally renowned quintet Beoga playing live at the internationally acclaimed event.Trad sensation Beoga, who collaborated with Ed Sheeran for his  chart topping hit ‘Galway Girl’ will take to the stage, for what is set to be the biggest Gradam Ceoil to date.Gradam Ceoil is the premier annual traditional music awards, with this year’s event set to be televised live on TG and available to stream on BBC iPlayer live from Belfast on Sunday February  thanks to support from Northern Ireland Screen’s Irish Language Broadcast Fund.The band are looking forward to their upcoming performance in Belfast.“We are delighted to be involved in the rdannual Gradam Ceoil TG traditional music awards celebration.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mclaughlin pays tribute to reds second half hunger","story":"CLIFTONVILLE boss Paddy McLaughlin paid tribute to his side’s second-half effort in their dramatic injury-time County Antrim Shield comeback win against Ballymena. The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"register now for the craic 10k st","story":"BELFAST’S First Citizen was onhand to officially launch the annual SPAR Craic K.Set to kick-start St Patrick’s Day celebrations on March , thousands of runners are set to take part in the urban run which is celebrating its sixth year.Lord Mayor Danny Baker told the Andersonstown News that he will counting down the race as runners go through their paces.“I will be starting the race and as much as I would love to take part I have a sore knee at the minute and that’s my excuse,” he laughed. “This is a huge event for the city and I’m delighted that a portion of the funds raised will go towards Marie Curie cancer charity.

The Chancellor intends to introduce a % levy on the revenues of search engines, social media s and online marketplaces which derive value from UK users.He has said the digital services tax will only be a temporary measure until an international agreement is in place on how to deal with online giants such as Google and Facebook.But Mr Mnuchin said the US believes “any tax that is designed specically on digital companies is a discriminatory tax”.He said such a tax is “not appropriate” and has “violations to our tax treaties and other issues”.“So, we’re working through that and I think we have a good outcome of trying to give some room now in  to continue these discussions.”"},{"url":null,"title":"rabbit hops on board for ride on london bus","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They installed new coolant pumps last month to revive the instrument’s crippled cooling system and needed to check for any leaks in the plumbing.Provided everything goes well, the two billion Us dollars spectrometer — launched to the space station in  — could resume its hunt for elusive anti-matter and dark matter next week, according to Nasa.Whats in store for todays spacewalk  A work commute of epic proportions. This animation shows how @AstroDrewMorgan will ride on the @Space_Stations robotic arm #Canadarm to reach the worksite. Live coverage continues: https:t.co IxdcIMUA pic JfejXRm— NASAJanuary , Nasa has described the spectrometer spacewalks as the most complicated since the Hubble Space Telescope repair missions a few decades ago. Unlike Hubble, this spectrometer was never intended for astronaut handling in orbit, and it took Nasa years to devise a repair plan.Despite their complexity, the first three spacewalks went well. Mr Morgan and Mr Parmitano had to cut into stainless steel pipes to bypass the spectrometer’s old, degraded coolant pumps, and then spliced the tubes into the four new pumps — no easy job when working in bulky gloves. The system uses carbon dioxide as the coolant.Besides checking for leaks, the astronauts had to cover the spectrometer with thermal insulation.“Good luck out there, have a lot of fun,” astronaut Jessica Meir radioed from inside. “We are very excited for you to be finishing off all of the amazing work that you’ve already put into this AMS repair, and I think everyone’s excited to the prospects of what AMS has to offer once you guys finish off the work today.”Wondering who’s who as you watch the spacewalk  �� @AstroDrewMorgan: red stripes on spacesuit, helmet cam #⚪️ @Astro_Luca: no stripes on spacesuit, helmet cam #. https:t.co IxdcIMUA pic bOqVtkpbyN— NASAJanuary , The massive .-ton spectrometer was launched to the space station on Nasa’s penultimate shuttle flight. Until it was shut down late last year for the repair work, it had studied more than  billion charged cosmic rays. The project is led by Samuel Ting, a Nobel laureate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.The repairs should allow the spectrometer to continue working for the rest of the le of the space station, or another five to  years. It was designed to operate for three years and so already has surpassed its expected letime.Saturday’s spacewalk got started a little late. A strap on a bag accidentally got caught in the seal when one of the inside hatches was closed and the air lock had to be reopened and repressurised before the astronauts could go out.Nasa’s two other astronauts on board, Ms Meir and Christina Koch, performed two spacewalks over the past few days weeks to upgrade the space station’s solar power system.Altogether, this station crew has gone out on nine spacewalks."},{"url":null,"title":"510981","story":"The Shantallow Community Centre is to be demolished tomorrow to make way for a new pound. million facility, but before the doors close for the last time we spoke to the man who was instrumental in getting it built.Erected in , the pound, building was supposed to last a decade, but it has served the area for  years.When Derek McCauley moved to Moyola Walk with his we and three children in  there was only a shop and a chemist.Shantallow was just a field, said Mr McCauley, who worked in Coolkeeragh Power Station.The only amenity was Patsy Owens shop and the chemist.I was coming from a place where we had dance halls and picture houses, Shantallow didnt even have a bus service.The bus stopped at Belmont and we didnt have a chapel. We had to go to Pennyburn. googletag.cmd.push  Derek McCauley, founder member of Shantallow Community Centre. Photo - Deirdre Heaney, nwpresspics  The move was a big culture shock.I saw a very urgent need to get an organisation together to improve the situation.I felt what was needed was a tenants association.The seeds of the Shantallow Tenants Association were sown when the residents began organising bus runs to Moville and Malin.It was a great opportunity for neighbours to get to know each other and there was a general consensus that more should be done for the young families in the area.In , just before the outbreak of the Troubles, Mr McCauley wrote  to the Belfastasking for help as he knew there were a lot of tenants associations in the Greater Belfast area.Groups from across the North advised him how to go about setting up a tenants association.The Highfield Tenants, Association, Amalgamated Corporation Tenants Asso- ciation, Tullycarnet Tenants Association, Lyne Social Club in Larne, North Belfast Tenants Association and the National Federation of Tenants Associations all wrote to me.I received lots of replies and they supplied me very useful advice.Most of these associations were political and non sectarian and I still have those letters.The main theme of these letters was use your politicians, but dont let them use you.The first meeting was held in a small gun club in the area by founder members, Danny Cooley, Tom Doherty, Sally Fleming and Mr McCauley.Mr McCauley was elected as chairman and Mr Cooley was elected as treasurer and it quickly became clear a community centre was needed.We put a questionnaire around the estate asking would they like a centre and what they would like to see in it and we got a great response.The association met with the Housing Trust  and made their case.We met with a lady called Miss MCCullough. She was a great help to us and I think we struck a chord with her, said Mr McCauley.The reason we were successful was because we were non political and non sectarian.When we went to ask for anything we asked politely and we didnt demand it.The Shantallow Community Centre was the first of its type to be built in the city and cost pound,.Its was only supposed to last  years, said Mr McCauley.The centre was soon a hive of activity and people came from across the city to use it.We had a childrens play group, handicraft classes, Irish dancing classes, piano lessons, a childrens disco and a youth disco on a Saturday night.It was the only disco of its kind in the city at that time we had young people coming from Newbuildings and the foot of Bishop Street for that.You would find them standing outside after and they had no way of getting home, so I would have given them a lt in my big yellow Zephyr.Everyone remembers the Zephyr. If I go to a wake in Shantallow people say to me do you still have that big yellow car The list of activities at the centre continued to grow with gymnastics, rollerskating, indoor bowls and bingo.In  they held a cross community festival for all the churches in the area.It was a good time, said Mr McCauley.It was all young families living in the area and on the summer days you would have thought there was a swarm of bees out on the back square but it would just have been all the children.That was before phones and Playstations.The work of the centre stretched far outside its doors with bus runs, dinner dances, outdoor festivals, sports competitions and luncheon clubs.Mr McCauley dedicated countless hours to it, but he said none of it would have been possible without the support of his we, Rita, who sadly passed away two years ago.She was the most important person, he said.We had six children and she had to rear them all.Mr McCauley eventually retired from the Tenants Association in , but not before he shared his knowledge with community groups across the city. A long list of people gave many volunteer hours to the Shantallow Tenants Association and Community Centre.I would like to wish all future communities the success we had and give a special thanks to all those people who made it so successful. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Independent Councillor, Gary Donnelly, who lives in the Creggan area said it is a “vital and important” development for the community but also expressed his concern that the project received no financial support from the government or local authorities. “It has been four decades since Creggan has had direct and convenient access to dedicated professional health care services on its doorstep. I would commend Creggan Enterprises, a local charity and social enterprise, for their vision and commitment to delivering on this much needed community service. googletag.cmd.push “And it must be noted that despite the constant state and media focus on Creggan, and the clearly articulated need for investment in communities like Creggan – it is inspiringsomewhat concerning that Creggan Enterprises was required to self-finance this crucial capital project.” Cllr Donnelly added: “It is indeed concerning that this much needed, innovative project did not receive financial support from any local authority, government body or department – despite the massive health inequalities facing the inhabitants of this community. “It is my understanding that the new state of the art facility will provide not only GP provision but also a dedicated MDT service, which will help address many of the physical and mental health needs of this growing community. googletag.cmd.push “I wish the project every success and I am sure that it will generate enormous health and well-being benefits for the people of Creggan and beyond.” Sinn Feacutein Cllr Tina Burke welcomed the facility as a “great addition” to community infrastructure within the area. “It is timely because we are actually in the middle of the Triax mental health week which is where all organisations are trying to promote services within the area. “I’d like to say well done to Creggan Enterprises in leading it and for pushing forward with the initiative, it’s a much needed service and it’s great that we will have it here in the middle of Creggan.” ‘Accessible’ Local health spokesperson for the SDLP, Mark H. Durkan described it as a “very positive development.” He added: “It’s well accepted that the best way to deliver health care is by providing services in the community. “It brings services closer to people and reduces pressure on our hospitals at the same time. It’s vital that these services are accessible to people, whereas in the past we have seen huge dficulty in accessing some services, particularly in the area of mental health.” Meanwhile, People Before Profit Cllr for the Moor area, Eamonn McCann, enthusiastically received the hub saying: “It brings the provision of medicine and health care closer to the community. “It will make it less stressful for people going to seek basic medical treatment. At times services like medical centres and post offices have been seen to desert the community so what’s happening in Raacuteth Moacuter, which sits in between the Bogside and Creggan, will benefit the entire community. “We have to create a healthy environment for people in terms of air quality and so on but also create medical facilities for those who fall ill. It’s the type of development People Before Profit and I would welcome.” Commenting on the -year gap in medical provision in Creggan, he added: “It’s a bit of a paradox. It’s no surprise but all statistics would show that the poorer a community is, when inequalities exist in a community, then the more likely you are to have medical problems. “So, it’s important that health provision should be as close as possible to those most likely to need it.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They faded and after a briefthey disappeared again. But now they are back, building from the foundations up. Club PRO Paddy McCann spoke to Michael McMullan, to trace their steps back into the world of club hurling. As a new decade turned earlier this month, Slaughtneil took the aristocrats of club hurling – Ballyhale Shamrocks – to the pin of their collar. Following the dramatic conclusion to an equally epic encounter, the Emmets narrowly missed out on qualication for Sundays All-Ireland final. But it was the subplot that struck an equally loud chord across Ulster. googletag.cmd.push After the game, Ballyhales players and their iconic manager Henry Shefflin were swamped by fans in search of autographs and selfies. A genuine outpouring of passion mixed with adoration. The glee etched across youngsters faces spoke volumes. In the recent past, its, perhaps, the biggest sign that the pockets of hurling across Ulster are alive and well. Bursting to get out. Witnessing it first hand was inspiring. Last November , another Kilkenny icon was in Ulster. It was a dferent brief entirely. Martin Fogarty coached many of the hurlings greatest. But in his role as hurlings National Development Manager, he was up in Drummullan to present medals to the underage players of St Finbarrs hurling club. googletag.cmd.push Two years after theirfrom the hurling wilderness, the clubs U team won the Ulster shield. They now unveil their plans for registration evenings later this month, giving Irelands national game another opportunity to spread its wings. And in the north of the county, Claudy are putting their roots down in search of another success story. For St Finbarrs, they have a heritage. In the late s hurling was played in the Loup area before the club was formed around the turn of the s. Of the three county finals they competed in the took the title in  and . They had quality players in brothers Liam and Colm Hinphey. John James McPeake, Sean and Francie Smith, M and Brian Mitchell. Patsy Donnelly. Joe McKee. S McGrogan. Henry McGlone. They also had Cork man Pat Russell in their ranks, who hailed from a club of the same name on Leeside. After the initial burst, St Finbarrs disappeared. It reformed later for a short time in the early eighties but ran out of steam before the newest dawn, when the wheels were set in motion for the club as it currently exists. Kilkenny man Brian Waldron, from Freshford, married Sheila Devlin and in recent years they settled in her native Loup. Their sons Odraacuten, Cian and Naoise hurled with Cuala and won Nicky Rackard Cup medals with Derry two years ago.   In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back. Paddy McCann  Brian, now the St Finbarrs Chairman, has hurling in his blood. He was involved with Kilkenny minors in the early noughties and, since histo Derry, has been coaching in seven of the local schools in the Loup area...spreading the gospel. The interest morphed into an informal meeting in January , that included Derrys Regional Hurling Development Officer Kevin Hinphey and Dunloy native Seamus Kane, who now resides in Loup. Kevins father Liam was part of the  St Finbarrs winning team. “Brian went around the local schools coaching and developed an appetite for hurling,” recalls St Finbarrs PRO Paddy McCann, one of the six at that initial meeting. “There was a group of us there at the start. Niall Lagan was there as well, his father also played on the  St Finbarrs team.” And so it began. Following Ogra Colmcilles withdrawal from the Derry junior league, they reached out to St Finbarrs, offering their premises base to help them build an identity. They are indebted to Ogra and to St Patricks PS Loup, where they host meetings. “The first night at Drummullan, it was like the build it and they will come sort of idea,” explains McCann of the new dawn in May . “We didnt really know who was going to turn up and when they called itthere was the guts of  youngsters...it was fantastic.” Now the club has over  members with  playing junior members. The players come from a iety of parishes in the South Derry and Loughshore area. The formation of the club has ensured access to hurling for all children in the area. It began with Us and earlier this month that cohort, mainly still Us, fielded the clubs first U team. “We would be expecting to field at U, U and at the younger ages. In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back,” McCann adds. “That would have been from Us, Us, Us, Us and down to Us.” Their growth has been helped by Brian Waldrons brainchild, the St Finbarrs Cup. A tournament played between the schools within their catchment area. Some field two teams, with eight or nine players in each. Its all about participation. “It is part of Brians work going around the schools, he organises it in Meadowbank and all the schools he was at would come in and play,” McCann explains. “It feeds into all the schools and for anyone showing promise and an interest, we can get them to play for St Finbarrs.” The Us and Us have had the privilege of playing at Croke Park in Go Games for the last two years. The youngsters are competing well and are going from strength to strength. The club achieved their first on field victory in October , when they won the Ulster U Regional Shield played against very competitive Letterkenny and Slaughtneil sides at Dungivens Kevin Lynch Park. At the presentation night, Martin Fogarty offered advice to carry on into this season, as they strive to grow. He emphasised the pride the club should take in passing on skills to the children and promoting hurling in the area. They had a blueprint for others to tap in to. “He spoke well about the club and he said he had heard about us,” McCann recalls of Fogartys address on the night. “Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example for other clubs.” Already this year, St Finbarr’s has made further strides with entry in the U North West indoor league. They have also entered teams into the U U Tain Oacuteg regional leagues run by Croke Park, as well as U league and Feacuteile. In their recent historic debut at U level, they gave a good account of themselves in a blitz that included Tyrone clubs Naomh Colmcille, Fintona, Belnaleck of Fermanagh and Dungloe. All with a  back-boned by Us. In any club, the people are the real assets. St Finbarrs are no dferent. Kevin Hinphey and Colm Dillon helped steer the coaching in the early days. The club described the input as immense but now the aim is to become self-sufficient. “Seamusand Brianare great for bringing people in. At our AGM, there were people volunteering that never played hurling to get doing coaching courses in it. “There is a lot of good will and parents are really buying into it. Some of the people are not really from GAA backgrounds.” It ensures that the future looks bright and their door is open to all new coaches and players, of all abilities. Everyone is welcome and there is always something to aspire to. Two years ago, three of the clubs U players represented Derry at half-time in their game with Down in the Christy Ring Cup. “They are holding their own. You would know they have started a few years later than other clubs but their skill levels are coming up,” McCann explains of how their oldest underage stars have progressed.   Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example. Paddy McCann  “There are a couple of guys and their skill levels are right up there with what other clubs have. We just dont have enough yet to be competing across the team but I can see them moving right up.” A club with championship tradition dating back to the s is back on the map. With continued efforts and promotion, maintaining their drive towards U and adult hurling is a target. As well as getting players through to Derrys Celtic Challenge team...and further. It would signy payback on a bigger scale and a chance for their club to grow further. For now, the Gaels in this corner of the county will continue to raise the bar. St Finbarrs registration for the  season takes place in Meadowbank on Tuesday, January  and Tuesday, February  at ..

He was always destined for success. His mother Catriona is an Ulster and All-Ireland champions camogie player, before moving into coaching where titles also streamed in her direction. Garys father Ronnie and grandfather George are steeped in motorbikes. On a dferent tangent, his sister Lara is both a champion gymnast and trampolinist. Sport simply runs in the family. For the  year-old St Patricks Maghera pupil, he has excelled in the world of motorsport despite only going into his third season in the saddle. Gary has competed on the Irish minibike circuit since its inception in , finishing second in the junior class, before graduating to the senior ranks last season. googletag.cmd.push In recent weeks, he was awarded the prestigious David Wood scholarship which the Motorcycle Union of Ireland awards to its most promising rider. It was won for the first time in  by Lee Johnston, winner of the last seasons Junior Isle of Man TT winner. He also took on the role of IMC Youth Ambassador – to act as a role-model for our younger members. “During this time Gary has shown maturity beyond his years, building up a great rapport with our Junior Members and his peers,” commented IMC Chairman Mark Boyd. “In addition to his abilities as a competitor, his positive attitude in success or defeat coupled with the clear commitment shown by both Gary and his family to his budding racing career bode well for his future. googletag.cmd.push “As Chairman of The Irish Minibike Championship I am privileged to recommend Gary for inclusion in the  BTC and wish him every success with the selection process.” His mothers reluctance stalled Garys career until just before his th birthday but she is now fully behind him since his early short circuit days. In , he progressed to the IMC Senior Open and Ulster Superbike Moto Championship. “Last year he was doing pit bikes with young kids but this year he went on to the short circuits and he was racing against adults, when he won the Moto championship,” Catriona said. “Now he is hoping to go to the British Superbikes on a Moto as well.” “As a rookie in the USBK Moto Championship, against some very experienced and older riders I came away with the title USBK Moto Champion ,” Gary outlined in his CV, which has been compiled with the view to attracting sponsorship for this season and a shot at the Moto class. The costings for next season could amount to over poundk, including a pound, Honda NSFR bike, entry fees and travel. “At the end of next year my aim is to make a wildcard into the Spanish Championship with my future dream to ride in the World Championships,” Gary added. He grew up watching and supporting both his father and grandfather in action on both the circuits and roads. It was no surprise to see him emerge from their shadows. His family helped him raise the funds for a trip to Donnington to compete in a round of the British Superbikes to help gather invaluable experience and a taste of what  could bring. MCUI Trainer and respected journalist and photographer Baylon McCaughey was full of praise for Gary. “Despite the cold and wet weather Gary, despite having only one season of tarmac racing under his belt in Pit Bike Racing, showed great enthusiasm and certainly was not afraid to ask questions,” he said. “After each session, he would enquire,he was doing the correct thing or not, and listened to advice given. “With plans to compete in the British Championships, I know this lad has the correct approach to his racing, his manners off the track, and competitiveness on the track, will certainly help him to achieve his goals.” Talent, with an attitude to match. Perhaps the greatest combination. If the next two years follow his meteoric rise since , Gary Scott is destined for greatness. Remember the name.

His support has been an immense source of personal pride. I hope that I’ve done him proud in .“Seamus lived for Ireland and worked for all of its people - we are all the better for it.“The pride of Seamus’ le was his dearly loved late we Gertrude, their daughter Orla and granddaughter Lara.My thoughts and prayers are with Orla, her husband Mark, and Lara at this dficult time. I hope they’re comforted by Seamus’ incredible legacy and the indelible mark he left on the lives of so many people.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lyndon Stephens died that morning after battling stoically against illness. His record label, Quiet Arch, was already planning to go into hiatus due to his illness and had planned a farewell gig in the Belfast Empire for that very evening. As fate would have it, it became his wake. I am a firm believer in the human spirit being how people remember you and I prefer to gather other people’s memories for things like this. Ryan Vail: “The man that gave me a career in music, toured me around the world, put me on tv, put me on radio, made me a headline festival artist, got me sound tracking, got me remixing, got me producing, got me talking on some of the most important industry , got me the most prestigious funding awards my manager, friend, label partnerLyndon Stephens.“I was his very first signing nine years ago and stayed with him the whole time. We released together, toured together started labels together, found acts together and had hours of phone calls together daily. “To be honest it’s been so so dficult to comprehend. Im really grateful for the memories we shared together.“RIP Lyndon, thank you for changing my le”Ciaran Lavery: “I first met Lyndon Stephens at Output, Belfast. He didn’t know me or owe me anything but kept putting me forward to talk to the local press that were at the event. “After the show, he askedI’d like to chat to him about working together. “Over the course of the next five years we broke down so many walls and glass ceilings. We spoke on the phone three for four times a day every day. I could call him at ungodly hours and he always answered, he was always there, Lyndon loved to talk. He was an incredible human being with a wonderful family and friends circle. “I know that when any friend musician needed advice of funding I pointed them towards Lyndon andhe had the time, he gave it willingly. I have an incredible amount of memories. I will miss my old friend so dearly, but in truth, I am truly blessed to have met Lyndon Stephens”.Francesca O’Connor, from Quiet Arch ,said “Lyndon Stephens, a man who wanted to make a genuine dference to this world, give the underdogs a  to shine and to show the world the incredible talent coming out of Northern Ireland. “He set up an artist management company, Champion Sound Music and record label, Quiet Arch, to put Northern Ireland artists on the international stage. I will forever be grateful to him for hiring me as a trainee artist manager . years ago. “As a young female with little experience but an eagerness to learn, he gave me a chance. I can only take inspiration from his creativity, decisiveness, determination and unwavering passion to succeed to carry on what he started. “Not long ago, he sent me the poem Go All The Way by Charles Bukowski and I cant think of a better way to describe his tenacious spirit.” She concluded: A loving husband, father, sister and friend, Lyndon is undoubtedly one in a million and will never be forgotten”.Ben Magee, also of Quiet Arch said “Lyndon’s biggest strength, and of those he had many, was when he believed in you, you knew about it. He was never one to shower you with praise, butyou had Lyndon in your corner, he made you feel like you could conquer the world. “A profound, hilarious inidual who was always one step ahead of everyone  in the room, Lyndon never spent a second of his le saying goodbye. “He always had his eyes fixed squarely on the horizon, eyebrows raised, a mad cackle dancing on the corner of his mouth. He was a mentor, a confidant, an always open ear and a friend. And I will miss him dearly.”My memories of Lyndon are very similar to Ciaran’s and probably most other people’s. he was always willing to help and preferred to talk over the other means of communication. If I ever went off the deep end with one of my rants at the music scene here Lyndon would message me quickly to calmly explain how things worked and how I might be right but mostly how I was wrong. It always began with a text message but was always swtly abandoned in favour of a chat. Always knowledgeable and always reasonable I will truly miss the advice and am forever grateful for the counsel. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He said: “Over recent months, we have been reporting street lighting faults on an almost daily basis in every part of my constituency. The response has sadly been that due to budgetary constraints, the Department are only providing a limited street lighting repair service with priority repairs focused on emergency repairs, group outages and all day burners, followed by single light defects.”“This is alarming. Adequate street lighting is imperative to provide safe streets, deter crime and anti-social behaviour and crucially provides elderly residents with security and safety and the assurance that they are not isolated and alone. In some areas a single light can be % of the lighting in a cul-de-sac, so the fact that one light is out makes a real dference.”“Having raised the issue with the Divisional Office, I was advised this was due to budgetary constraints and until additional funds became available, only a limited repair service would be possible. I subsequently sought an intervention from the Permanent Secretary and sought details as to the extent of the problem.”“To my astonishment, the Department have now confirmed that almost , lights are out at present across the North. This is unacceptable and is a direct result of budget cuts. Last year the Street lighting budget was pound.m and it has been slashed by over a third to pound.m. Do people really think that when you strip out vital financial and human resources from a basic service that it will have no impact ”The SDLP Assemblyman added: This needs to be urgently addressed. I will continue to liaise with Departmental officials to press for action.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

January.The event will include contributions from some of Ireland’s leading sus- tainability experts and innovators.The theme of Dr Doherty’s address will be “Rethinking Green Spaces,” an area in which Derry City and Strabane District Council has been leading on with the recent publication of their pioneering Green Infrastructure Plan.Speaking ahead of the event, Dr Doherty noted the local authority had led the way in transforming the way its green spaces are used.“Transforming and valuing our local green spaces to benefit people, our economy and environment is a key priority for Derry City and Strabane District Council, which is outlined in our cutting edge Green Infrastructure Plan,” she said.“We are the first local authority in Northern Ireland to produce a Green Infrastructure Plan and associated action plan which highlights the signicant positive health implications of spending time in green spaces, the critical role ecosystem services play for mitigating against climate change, as well as the potential opportunities they offer for businesses to create jobs locally, for example, through expanding our greenway network.“We are currently in the process of assessing the monetary value of our green spaces through the creation of a Natural Capital Account in partnership with Vivid Economics and The Carnegie Trust.“This pioneering research will show the benefits of living close to a park or green area, which increases the value of property as well as providing a community space for people to socialise and exercise.“The results highlight that green areas provide signicant mental and physical wellbeing value as well as recreational benefits and improvements to the air that we breathe.”The National Sustainability Summit aims to enable visitors to keep up-to-date with the latest trends, innovations, best practice and new technological solutions available.The event will address areas such as optimising water usage, renewable energy, sustainable packaging, waste minimisation and moving towards a circular economy.It will also highlight how the power of data and technology can be harnessed to achieve more transparent supply chains. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Speaking as the first phase of the scheme neared completion Kevin Campbell, development worker with the Triax Neighbourhood Management Team, said: “In the last few years it has become clear that there are increasing numbers of older residents in the Triax area who are experiencing problems maintaining the exterior of their homes or gardens, for whatever reason.” googletag.cmd.push “Recognising this, and working with Awards for All and other groups we have been able to design and fund a pilot programme of home assistance for older residents in three identied areas in the Triax area. This programme is obviously complementary to the ongoing work of the Triax Neighbourhood Management Team and helps us help harder to reach residents.” Mr Campbell continued: “The TNMT are delighted to be able to provide this assistance and in the next few months we will also be in the Iniscarn and Beechwood areas as this scheme rolls out. “As we work towards making the area a cleaner, safer and more welcoming place to live it is crucial we assist those who need assistance to make the dferences that matter to them. The Awards for All funded Home Assistance Programme is helping us to do that.” googletag.cmd.push Oakfield resident, Charles O’Donnell, who has helped roll out the scheme said: “Little did I realise when Kevin contacted me how the scheme would impact on iniduals within the Oakfield area. “After an initial assessment during which a multitude of homes were visited a list of properties which required urgent and essential work was drawn up. During the following two weeks nine of these received a iety of works from basic power washing, removal of large amounts of wasps and, in two particular cases extensive cutting back of hedges, brambles and trees.” “A particular highlight of strength of the scheme was the group of men who carried out the work. Good craic, kind, considerate, welcoming and extremely hard working are just a few words which describe the team.” Mr ODonnell concluded: “The residents and myself will be eternally grateful for their consideration and support. Sincere thanks to Donna, Kevin and the whole TRIAX team.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This can help tackle both the obesity epidemic and improve childrenrsquos overall health and well-being.The Active School Travelprogramme which Sustrans delivers has successfully increased the number of pupils walking, cycling and scooting to school, with the charity explaining that it takes on  new schools each year.However, it says the programme needs to expand and provide more long-term support to school communities in order to turn around these statistics.In the   period, the number of children walking, cycling and scooting to school in the AST programme increased from % to % while, at the same time, the number of pupils being driven to school fell from % to %.Cllr Walker says he is ldquoall for getting more children to walk to school, but explained that in some parts of Down District, this simply isnrsquot possible as in many rural areas there are no footpaths. In addition, he said there are no dedicated cycle paths.ldquoI fully support the work of Sustrans and have worked with the charity on a number of schemes in my own area, he revealed.ldquoI recognise that the more children who walk to school, the less congestion there will be and fewer cars sitting in traffic queues pumping dangerous fumes into the atmosphere.Cllr Walker said mph zones have been introduced outside some local schools, calling for such schemes to be rolled out across all council areas.He added: ldquoWith the emphasis now on people taking more responsibility for their own health and getting fitter, encouraging children to walk to school when it is safe to do so will sew the seed of keeping healthy from an early age and this will stay with them for the rest of their lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Delay.jpg","title":"Delay for development meeting on Irish Street  ","story":"AN event designed to provide business owners in Downpatrick with an input into plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings has been delayed.Originally scheduled to take place before Christmas the meeting was delayed in the wake of the snap Westminster election, with hopes that it would go ahead this month.Now it has emerged that it could be February or March before what is being viewed as one of the most signicant town centre regeneration meetings ever to take place in the district takes place.A number of Downpatrick councillors were recently given the opportunity to view the inside of the former police base and the expansive grounds to the rear which will feature heavily in the proposed redevelopment scheme.The old police base enjoys protected status and therefore cannot be razed to the ground to pave the way for any new development. As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials have this week reaffirmed their commitment to work with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site, with the project being spearheaded by the Department of Communities.Council officials say that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what local people would like to see and what would work at this particular site.Officials insist that there is little point developing options which they think might work, with the forthcoming meeting with all stakeholders designed to secure by-in from them and develop a project that is likely to succeed.The planned meeting with all stakeholders will help shape a development brief inviting potential developers to come forward to transform the site and kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.In addition, the development brief will outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Local councillor Dermot Curran said the recent visit to the proposed Irish Street development site provided an insight into its size and development potential.He is backing the move to involve businesses and residents in helping shape the development brief for the site and hopes that the planned meeting at which they will be asked for their input can take place soon.ldquoWhat we are talking about is the biggest ever investment in Downpatrick town centre. We have to get this right as it has the potential to not only regenerate Irish Street, but the wider town centre by attracting increased footfall which will boost existing businesses, many of them locally owned, said Cllr Curran.ldquoIt is clear that having viewed the Irish Street site that it offers massive potential and can transform Downpatrick town centre and provide a major boost for existing businesses.Cllr Curran said he has spoken to a number of business people who are keen to have the date of the meeting with consultants confirmed so they can attend to help play their part in shaping the future development of a prominent town centre site.He added: ldquoPeople want to see progress on this crucially important development. Redeveloping the expansive Irish Street site can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment and will provide a boost for existing businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down senior footballers face tough opener  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS senior footballers head for Clonmel on Sunday more in hope than optimism to open their Division  Allianz League campaign against Tipperary.Paddy Tallyrsquos charges face a tough opening game as the Premier County, who were relegated from Division  last season, will be like a wounded animal and determined to bounce back into the leaguersquos second tier.The sides met last June at Pairc Esler when Down won an All-Ireland Qualier - to -. Pat Havern, Corey Quinn and Donal OrsquoHare did most of the scoring that day, but Tipperary will be a dferent proposition at the weekend.New Tipp manager David Power, who famously led the county minors to an All-Ireland title in , has an abundance of talent at his disposal, but he will have to without star player Michael Quinlivan.The Clonmel Commercials man has decided to go travelling for a year and his absence is a huge loss to Tipperaryrsquos attack and the countyrsquos bid to regain their status in the top flight ahead of next seasonrsquos championship changes.Promotion is also a must for Down as well, as they too have huge aspirations of avoiding competing in the All-Ireland second tier competition.Down have just emerged from an indferent McKenna Cup campaign.Wins over Fermanagh and Antrim were cast aside when Tallyrsquos team were given a reality check by Tyrone in the semi-finals.Mickey Hartersquos experimental side simply over-powered Down and had too much physicality all over the park.Hopefully, Down will have learned from that game, but second guessing Tallyrsquos team selection ahead of Sunday is a dficult job.Definitely missing Sundayrsquos game will be vice-captain Caolan Mooney, the one player in the camp who has the ability to stand out from the rest. His unavailability through injury is a severe blow to Tallyrsquos aspirationsJohn OrsquoHare and Marc Hynes shared the goalkeeping duties in the two McKenna Cup games, but Castlewellanrsquos Rory Burns is still considered as the county number one.Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins, Burrenrsquos Kevin McKernan and Warrenpointrsquos Ryan McAleenan could well man the full back berths with Annaclonersquos Brendan McArdle also in the frame.A knee injury for Saulrsquos Pierce Laverty, picked up against Tyrone, could rule him out of action, but Daniel Guinness could well fill in for him at right half back. Captain Darren OrsquoHagan seems to be favourite to start at centre half back with a mixture of Ross Carr, McArdle, Mayobridgersquos Shane Annett and Guinness flanking him.Midfield has been a bit of a problem for Down, but Loughinislandrsquos Jonny Flynn should start in this sector with either Liatroimrsquos Liam Middleton, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan, Carryduffrsquos Owen McCabe or Longstonersquos Conor Poland most likely to get the nod.The set of six forwards will come from Poland, McCabe, Corey Quinn, Barry OrsquoHagan, Conor Maginn, Pat Havern, Donal OrsquoHare, Brendan Gallen, Ciaran Harney, Liam Kerr and Ross McGarry.Regardless of who Tally starts with, Tipperary will be no pushovers and now under Powerrsquos management, they will be keen to impress.Michael OrsquoReilly, Liam Fahey, Bill Maher, Robbie Kiely, Jack Kennedy, Conor Sweeney and Liam Treacy all showed up well in Tipperaryrsquos recent McGrath Cup campaign and did enough, even without Quinlivan, to suggest that they will be a tough nut to crack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 22%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Rumours were re this week that it could be another ten years before the adoption of the poundm-plus scheme to provide a lsquoring roadrsquo in Downpatrick.Work on the scheme first started in the late sixties and, ironically, the Department of Environment is preparing to make a public announcement within the next two weeks on the route they want the road to take.But on Monday Downpatrick councillor Mr Eddie McGrady told a meeting of Down councillors that there were local rumours of another ten-year delay.Within the past  hours it has become obvious that the warning could take on realistic proportions.It seems clear that a wall of objections will be raised of the scheme and it could particularly take years to smooth out negotiations and pare the way for a pubic inquiry, which now looks inevitable.Mr McGradyrsquos warning came during a council discussion on a planning decision to refuse alterations and extensions to a dwelling in Saul Street, which is expected to be in the path of the new road.He drew the councilrsquos attention to a planning approval for squash courts in St Patrickrsquos Avenue mdash also likely to be in the path of the road mdash offering one explanation for the conflicting decisions.ldquoThere are rumours that planning permissions might be given in certain circumstances because it might be ten years before the road is implemented, he said.CROSSGAR mdash The st Crossgar Boys Brigade will represent Down Battalion in the Northern Ireland district finals of the squad drill competition in Omagh on Saturday.The Lissara boys qualied for the finals by wining the annual Down Battalion competition held at Banbridge on Monday night. Second was st Ballyroney, with st Raffrey finishing third.This is the most prestigious event in the Battalion calendar and a very high standard of drill was set by the locals, who have been practicing the movements for the past four months.Apart from the squad competition, there was also a squad commandant cup presented at Banbridge and Sgt M Cuffey, of Crossgar, was the winner.The overall competition was chaired by Mr D Partridge, Battalion president, assisted by Mr R Dickson, Battalion secretary. The judges were Mr E Torrans and Mr W Price, both from Belfast.LISSARA mdash A call has been made for a new minister for Lissara Presbyterian Church at Crossgar.He is the Rev Samuel Armstrong, at present assistant at Abbey Presbyterian Church, Monkstown, and he will succeed the Rev S A Matthew who left for Bannside Church in Banbridge seven months ago.Mr Armstrong is married with three children mdash twin daughters aged seven and another aged  months. He is a graduate of Queenrsquos University and worked as a physicist with Goodyear and British Enkalon.Rev Armstrong has also completed one yearrsquos voluntary service overseas in Ghana. He was a soccer blue at Queenrsquos and has played football for Crusaders and Ballyclare Comrades.The call was made at a meeting of the congregation on Tuesday night, presided over by the Rev James Lamont.BALLYNAHINCH mdash The Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch is one of ten schools who have won their way through to the finals of the lsquoStudying our Pastrsquo competition in the - years group.The team will now compete for the overall prize on Monday when their project will be judged along with the other entries by a  of ten judges at the Elmwood Hall, Belfast.The competition for young people in schools and colleges in Northern Ireland, is designed to win distinction for history teaching and is organised by the Churches Central Committee for Community Work.This year the theme is lsquoThe Settlement of Successive Peoples in Irelandrsquo, and the aim is to encourage children to realise, in the broad perspective of centuries the inidual contributions of successive waves of newcomers mdash the Celtic peoples, the Vikings, the Normans, the Scots and the English.Through the competition it is hoped to emphasise the value of the study of history and to give competitive enjoyment to children.SAINTFIELD mdash A Saintfield manrsquos designs will give Belfastrsquos Arthur Street a new look this year.He is Mr Don Wilkinson and he won a competition to design a central feature for the square. The Department of Environment is now set to make the plan a reality, at an estimated cost of pound,-pound,.Mr Wilkinson has been head of the school of three dimensional design at the Ulster Polytechnic for nine years. He lives in Saintfield but came to Northern Ireland from Bristol.His winning feature, he said, was a stainless steel structure, depicting the industrial traditions of Belfast, shipbuilding and aircraft, with its tanker profiles and aircraft wheels.He added: ldquoIt will probably be made by Belfast engineers.It will stand  feet high in the middle of a fountain and pond. Apart from a travelling scholarship he once won to study design, this is undoubtedly Mr Wilkinsonrsquos first big success.ldquoIt was one occasion when I believed designers should make a real effort to present a project.

They say they are simply removing mercury out of the rotating lens system and putting in a new ldquoinnovative mechanical bearing solution, insisting that the changes are not being driven by any

discuss the proposed changes at the lighthouse, CIL was urged by concerned residents and politicians to leave the lighthouse as it is and not to do anything to harm its heritage.There was also a warning that there would be ldquoructions at all levelsthe proposed changes were implemented, with several people pointing to the potential for the lighthouse to be transformed into a unique leading visitor attraction which would provide an economic boost for the area.Residents opposed to changes argue that Killough boasts the ldquofinest example of a lighthouse of its kind and that no one is in any doubt about the maritime history and heritage of St Johnrsquos Point and its uniqueness.Campaigners say that they are determined to protect the heritage of the lighthouse and suggest it is

potential to generate millions of pounds in tourism revenue.Typical activities in geoparks include the development of walking and cycling trails, training local people to act as guides, the provision of information signs and the development of visitor centres.Northern Irelandrsquos only other current geopark mdash the Marble Arch Caves which inhabits the rugged mountainous uplands and gentle rolling lowlands of counties Cavan and Fermanagh mdash contributes just over poundm to the economy in this area.Local council officials, who confirmed a pre-Christmas Recorder story that the formal bid for geopark status had been submitted, have revealed that an Area of Outstanding Natural Beautymanagement team for the three local areas has been created.Council officials say that they are continuing to work secure geopark status which is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism.But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious geopark designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with those behind the bid confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors in particular.But securing geopark status is not just about delivering financial benefit.Geoparks in other areas have empowered local communities, providing them with opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.If the local bid for geopark status for a huge swathe of land covering Strangford and Lecale, the Mournes and Ring of Gullion is successful, the international designation is expected to play a key role in helping transform the local economy.The geopark brand will use the geological heritage of the three areas to develop sustainable tourism that generates economic benefits, while providing recreational opportunities and increased awareness of the arearsquos natural assets, working with landowners, businesses and communities.The ultimate aim of a geopark is to enhance the economy and develop employment opportunities for the people who live there, but the global brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been

This year they donated a fantastic amount for the charities, said Raphael. ldquoI am delighted to see young people come on board to help others. They are a credit to their school and their families.Raphaelrsquos chance meeting with Martin, a homeless man living on the streets of Dublin whom he met during a visit to family members a number of years ago, was the catalyst for him to launch his annual appeal which has enjoyed tremendous community support.The photographerrsquos meeting with Martin underneath a railway bridge close to Pearse Street railway station had a profound impact on him, moving him to organise an appeal as soon as he ed home.ldquoThe sight of seeing Martin on Pearse Street back in  will be with me forever. To see homelessness on the rise across Ireland,north and south, means something is badly wrong. There doesnrsquot appear to be any political will to cure the problem. It there was, we would not have homelessness in a modern society. More needs to be done, immediately, said Raphael.Year on year the response to his appeal has increased and this year he will be looking for anyone interested in helping to get in touch to help with the collection, storage and distribution of donations.Raphael confirmed that he plans to launch his appeal for volunteers to join forces with him this October.ldquoI cannot begin to praise every single person who responded to my Christmas appeal. It was so overwhelming, he explained.ldquoAll I do is put the word out about my appeal and people come forward in great numbers to help. The response to the latest appeal was the biggest to date and I cannot thank people enough for their generosity and support.ldquoThe response from the public was truly unbelievable. I am particularly indebted to everyone, in particular, the staff and students at St Colmcillersquos High School.The annual appeal is particularly time-consuming for someone who runs his own business and that is why Raphael is hoping people will volunteer to help him in .ldquoEvery item that is donated has to be unpacked and checked to make sure it is okay to pass on. Then it has to be sorted, re-packed and stored until the time to deliver it comes. This takes up a lot of time and there is only so much one person can do, he explained.Raphael has also singled out the management and staff at Peter Fitzpatrick and Sons Estate Agents in Downpatrick for particular praise for allowing their Irish Street base to be used as a -off point for his appeal.ldquoThe business has been so supportive over the past number of years. I cannot thank them enough for all their help, he said.ldquoDePaul was over the moon with the items people donated and the fact that a signicant number of people took time out at Christmas to think of and help others is very humbling. If more people come forward to help me this year, together, we could do even more.In future Raphael hopes to deliver the majority of donations to more local charities and organisations. He said it only seems right that items collected are distributed locally so in future most of what he receives will go to local charities.He added: ldquoThe generosity and community spirit across the district is something to behold. All I do is announce details of the appeal and people across the community then donate in numbers.ldquoOnce the message gets out there, people are quick to respond and I am so grateful as are the organisations they are supporting.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.

Now, the aim is to grow that to £m, which includes a new office in Dublin to expand its market reach right across Ireland.“We are hoping to take that to £m in the next four years and we have opened an office in Dublin,” she told Ulster Business.“It’s an ambitious target, but we have grown year-on-year for the past nine years and have brought a lot of technology into the business and to our clients.”The client list reads like a who’s who of the giants of Northern Ireland industry, including poultry processor Moy Park, Almac and Devenish Nutrition. The firm has also looked after those on the Game of Thrones crew.“We have a strong track record of getting and maintaining good clients,” she says. “We are a new breed of travel management company. We want to make a dference in client businesses. “People, the human capital, is what the business is and making sure they are looked after while they travel is a big thing for us – doing it effectively, making sure they have the support,  .“I’ve been in travel for more than  years and I’m passionate about it. It has changed dramatically, with the rise of the smartphone.”That includes the development of booking tools for clients, but also looking ahead and building more advanced technology, incorporating articial intelligence and being able to personalise the experience for each traveller. Born in Belfast, Edel’s initial career trajectory looked set for university, but instead she wanted to go in to the world of work, and tackle the travel sector.“I went straight into the industry and I’m a great believer in le-long learning. I want to be the best version of me and to reach my potential,” she says. That includes working across dferent areas of the travel industry. But Edel says business travel “was always my love”.Edel is involved with the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Women in Business, as well as sitting on the CBI’s SME Council in London. She’s also just been named Businesswoman of the Year by Women in Business.And like many company founders, Edel hit the ground running with her own business as the world entered its worst recession in a generation. She was previously a director with a company for  years, before deciding to make the move and go it alone.“I made a business plan – I said to myself, I can do this, I know I can. I built a brilliant team around me, and almost  years later, here we are. It’s been hard work, but it’s enjoyable and I’m passionate about the Northern Ireland economy. I’m passionate about buying local.”As for Brexit, Edel says setting up the Dublin office was one was in which the firm was mitigating against any business concerns arising from Brexit.“It’s hard to plan when you don’t know. Business people are problem solvers,” she says. “Once we have a problem, we come up with a solution. But people are holding back on decisions. We did a complete analysis of our clients and they are down on last year. It completely filters down and there is a knock on effect and people are nervous.“A lot of our clients are exporters. If they are affected, everything from export documents, to the movement of goods and people – that willimpact.”Looking to the future and Edel’s ambitious £m turnover target she says leading the way in tech and being early adopters is helping to drive expansion.“We are looking out at what’s coming – some clients won’t work without technology, and we have tech bedded in. It’s tried and tested.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
