On the last leg of the visit, the Prince of Wales will speak at the International Conference Centre at the invitation of President Nana Akufo-Addo.While he will mainly use it to pay tribute to Ghana’s role in the Commonwealth, Charles was keen to reference the slave trade in Ghana and Britain and Europe’s role in it.He also wanted to use the occasion to highlight Britain’s determination to tackle modern slavery.The prince was visibly moved by a visit to Fort Christiansborg in Osu, a suburb of the capital Accra, during which he was told of its chilling history.Built in 1661, the fort – also known as Osu Castle – was used by the Danes to hold slaves before they were sent to the New World.In the 19th century, it became the headquarters of the local British government.Colombian star of Royal Ballet reveals he used...How the nation will remember next week: Hour-by-hour what\u0027s...Share this article    The Prince of Wales will mainly use his speech to pay tribute to Ghana’s role in the Commonwealth (pictured being greeted by dancers at Fort Christiansborg in Accra, Ghana)    Meghan and her mother Doria RaglandIn an unprecedented step, the Duchess of Sussex’s mother is expected to fly in from the US to spend Christmas with the Queen.Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland, 62, is said to have been invited to Sandringham to join her daughter and the rest of the Royal Family.The honour was not extended to Carole and Michael Middleton, parents of the Duchess of Cambridge.A royal source said it was ‘a very thoughtful gesture’, adding: ‘It’s a mark of the Queen’s respect for Meghan and an acknowledgement that she doesn’t have any other relations in this country – unlike Kate, who has a very close family.’The Middletons have joined the Queen at church on Christmas morning, but stayed with William.                                                     At the bottom were dungeons in which enslaved Africans were kept for up to six months as they awaited transportation.During a sombre moment in searing heat, Charles paused at the foot of the stairs, known as ‘the door of no return’, to reflect on the fort’s horrific past.In his speech today, he is expected to say: ‘The histories of our two nations are closely intertwined, and while today we enjoy shared opportunity, we can never forget that our past has sometimes borne witness to tragedy and loss and, at times, profound injustice. At Osu Castle, it was especially important to me – as indeed it was on my first visit there 41 years ago – that I should acknowledge the most painful chapter of Ghana’s relations with the nations of Europe, including the United Kingdom. The appalling atrocity of the slave trade, and the unimaginable suffering it caused, left an indelible stain on the history of our world.‘While Britain can be proud that it later led the way in the abolition of this shameful trade, we have a shared responsibility to ensure that the abject horror of slavery is never forgotten, that we abhor the existence of modern slavery and that we robustly promote and defend the values which today make it incomprehensible, to most of us, that human beings could ever treat each other with such utter inhumanity.’Charles will also pay tribute to the strength of the relationship between the UK and Ghana.He is keen to highlight the country’s role in the Commonwealth and stress how, by acting within the organisation, it can play an important role over environmental issues and rapid urbanisation.He will also acknowledge Ghana as an example to the region and to the world of a stable democracy, a beacon of tolerance and ersity.In his speech, the prince is expected to say: ‘The Commonwealth should strive for renewed relevance in the lives of its citizens and should draw upon its unparalleled networks of professional expertise, to offer practical solutions to some of the most pressing challenges of our time, many of which are increasingly deep seated and deeply integrated.‘No issue is more pressing than that of climate change.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/05/02/5771052-0-image-m-18_1541385560455.jpg","title":"The Isle Dogs big money","story":"Then and now: The old entrance to Millwall Outer Dock, West Ferry Road, 1982 (left) and today (right).

And it has endeared her to him even more.’Those closest to Charles draw a parallel between Meghan’s dignified forbearance in the face of hurtful comments from relatives, and how the Prince stoically endured public criticism from Princess Diana.‘Whatever they felt inside, they’ve both put on a strong public face and not hidden away,’ said another source.The Prince’s close rapport with Meghan, whom he walked down the aisle in place of her absent father, has delighted Prince Harry and senior members of the Royal Family. It is an understanding that has been further strengthened by a shared love of art, history and culture, with Charles describing Meghan as ‘incredibly smart’.Charles and Meghan’s bond is revealed in The Mail on Sunday’s Event magazine today by Royal biographer Angela Levin, who spent a year following the Prince ahead of his 70th birthday later this month.    The Prince’s close rapport with Meghan, whom he walked down the aisle (pictured) in place of her absent father, is said to have delighted Prince HarryCamilla has also warmed to Meghan. ‘Not least because both of them have joined the Royal Family from the outside,’ said a source. ‘Camilla goes out of her way to find time to spend with her, to get to know her and make her feel welcome.’As the tour of Australasia demonstrated, The Duchess’s transition from actress to high-profile Royal has been seamless – something that has gladdened Charles, who believes her Hollywood training has enabled Meghan to withstand intense scrutiny.In addition to the Event profile, The Mail on Sunday has learned from separate sources of a Scottish holiday enjoyed by Charles and the newlyweds over the summer.Charles entertained Harry and Meghan at the Castle of Mey, the late Queen Mother’s remote home in Caithness, telling friends he was ‘tickled pink’ when they agreed to join him. He also invited the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, but they declined.Sources said Charles told a member of his family that the week with his son and daughter-in-law was ‘joyous’. There were coastal walks and a spot of bird watching.‘I think it’s fair to say that Meghan has brought Harry and Charles closer, and Charles is thrilled to have a new daughter-in-law.‘Camilla wasn’t there, she was enjoying a bucket-and-spade holiday with her own children and grandchildren, so I think that made it even more special for Charles.’Meanwhile, Levin paints a portrait of a man who is settled, content and happy – more so than he has been for years. Marriage to Camilla - whom he frequently describes as ‘my darling wife’ – arrested his tendency to melancholy, particularly evident in the bleak period following the death of Princess Diana when his popularity plummeted and many said he was not fit to be King.  As Prince Charles prepares to turn 70, Event reveals a stunning photo album packed full of remarkably intimate pictures documenting his life from a royal baby to his life today as a doting grandfather Event brings you a colourful insight into the life of a prince with photos of Charles in his mother\u0027s arms, on tour around the world and  sharing tender moments with his wife Camilla          Princess Anne holds a bunch of daffodils as Prince Charles stands guard over a plant in 1954          The eight-month-old Prince makes an early play for the Crown Jewels as Royal mother and son share a tender moment in the garden of Windlesham Moor, Surrey, in July 1949, where the family lived for two years as they waited for a major refurbishment of Clarence House to be finished          Elizabeth counts her blessings as a parent while the baby Prince counts the balls on his abacus in an outdoor playpen in the grounds of the rented Windlesham Moor, a five-bedroom country house in Sunningdale with two guest rooms combined to make a nursery          Charles reaches for his rabbit which, along with a teddy, some yellow ducks, a submarine and an elephant on wheels called Jumbo, were his favourite first toys.

If people can get another bag in their bin they will get another bag in their bin — any way they can.’The favoured method in these parts involves climbing into the bin, then jumping up and down on the contents to compress them. Unpleasant, and not entirely risk-free. Others have resorted to stockpiling waste in sheds and garages, but complain about rodent infestations.Still more try to off-load black sacks on others, with or without permission. Another resident told how whenever he goes out to walk the dog he takes a carrier bag of rubbish with him, stuffing it in pavement bins as he goes. Some simply burn their waste in braziers or on back-garden bonfires. Fly-tipping is on the increase.          Families are struggling with the new regime as their bins overflow with rubbish          Sue Foster with her Overflowing bins in Old Colwyn, Conway          Despite the sign saying \u0027no fly tipping\u0027 rubbish had been dumped by these bins as residents complain that the offence is on the riseIn one town I visited, the over-sized wheelie bins set aside for flats had been fitted with padlocks. Those that had not were overflowing with black bags, many ripped open by birds or rodents. The contents, including soiled nappies and food waste, had spilled on to the pavements.‘It’s the four-weekly collection,’ said one local businessman in despair. ‘The council sent out a team to clear up the mess last week and now they’ll have to do the same again. How much will that cost? How can that make financial sense?’When the council introduced the scheme a month ago, they promised savings of £390,000 a year. All well and good, but as everyone in these parts is quick to point out, the same council has just had a king new office complex built for its staff.          Bits and piece of waste appeared to have escaped from the overflowing binsUnder a controversial deal with the developers, this will cost council tax payers in Conwy Council Borough £58 million over the next 40 years. Worse still, it has been suggested that they could face a council tax rise of 11 per cent next year. For what? Some homeowners are now so fed up they are digging further into their own pockets to pay a private firm £8.99 a week to empty their bins.And, of course, where one council leads, others follow. In recent weeks, Anglesey and Denbighshire councils have both signalled that they are considering introducing four-weekly collections too. Several English councils have introduced three-weekly collections.So the bin-management tactics I witnessed last week could soon become required practice nationwide. Meanwhile, there can be little doubt that when it comes to recycling, the residents of this corner of North Wales are already doing their bit.          Litter from Overflowing bins now lines the streets of Old Colwyn following the move to increase the time between bin collectionsFigures show that their waste recycling rate stands at 64 per cent. In England, the average is 44 per cent. But Conwy is under pressure to do more. By 2025, it must hit 70 per cent, a target set by the often intractable Welsh government. Failure to do so could result in fines of up to £600,000 a year. Like all councils, it is also under severe financial pressure.Boiling pavement burns skin off dog\u0027s paws and another is...Should your taxes pay for this? Labor politician wants EVERY...Share this articleThe council claims the various other collections — there are 19 in a month, such as food waste or textiles — will help. ‘It’s easy to recycle more,’ reads a line on the council’s website.Well, try telling that to retired teacher Sue Foster. The 65-year-old lives in Old Colwyn with her husband, her 40-year-old daughter, her grandson, 22, and granddaughter, 11. The family has three cats and a dog. When I met her on Wednesday, she was organising a vast array of recycling receptacles outside her detached home. There were two food caddies to put food waste in and three large plastic boxes with lids, each stacked one on top of the other.          On bin day extra bags of rubbish were piled high on top of household binsOne was for recyclable plastic and cans, another for glass and brown cardboard, and a third for white paper or grey card. When these get full, Mrs Foster has extra capacity in the form of two white nylon sacks.In addition there was a bin for sanitary waste and two green sacks for garden waste. Oh, and let’s not forget that black bin — filled to the brim and ready to be emptied for the first time in a month on Wednesday.‘I recycle everything but even so it is an absolute joke, it’s awful,’ says Mrs Foster, who has even resorted to flushing any dog mess down an outside toilet, rather than having it fester in bags in the black bin.‘The only way I have been able to manage is because my next-door neighbour has let me put sacks in his bin. There are five of us and only two of them — but we have the same size bin. I asked the council for a second black bin but I was told it’s only available for households of six or more. It’s absolutely ridiculous.’          Residents have resorted to stockpiling waste in sheds and garages, but complain about rodent infestationsA sentiment Donna Pimley-Jones of nearby Kinmel Bay can well understand. She has to pack her rubbish bin till it’s well over-flowing, plus cope with the myriad extra category bins the council has brought in. Of course, having a family makes it so much harder.Those I spoke to who lived on their own or as a couple were generally just about managing with the new collection arrangements and maximising the amount they recycled.But for families the lack of space in the refuse bin was a clear problem.Indeed, come bin day many of their homes could be identified simply by looking for over-filled bins with half-open lids. Which bring their own issues with them.Along the coast in Penmaenmawr last week a possible effect of the problem was there for all to see — a dead rat just yards from Neill and Emma Scullard’s bins.          Some over-sized wheelie bins set aside for flats had been fitted with padlocks‘We have two young children aged one and four months, and the rubbish quickly piles up,’ said Mr Scullard, 31, who works in the catering industry. ‘It’s obvious that the accumulating rubbish will bring rats in. You can sometimes see where they have ripped the plastic bags apart. It is a nightmare. It would make more sense if they gave us bigger bins.’In Colwyn Bay, meanwhile, the problem is greedy seagulls tearing at plastic bags.Carrie Harling, 31, a cleaning supervisor, and Ann-Marie Potter, 24, a cleaning assistant, are neighbours in a block of three flats that house 12 people, including seven children. Their waste has to fit in three bins.          When Conwy announced the move to monthly collections, the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health warned of the potential risks‘It’s a stupid scheme — two-weekly is bad enough, never mind four-weekly,’ said Ms Harling. ‘So the rubbish just mounts up in our black bin and we also have black bags full of rubbish in our back garden. The seagulls have a field day.’Others choose to avoid overloading their bins by disposing of waste as it accumulates. One parent I spoke to sheepishly admitted that he works in a school — and that each week he takes a bin-bag to dump in their bins.The concern is that others will resort to fly-tipping. A number of residents I speak with complain that there has been more dumping of rubbish in rural areas. Statistics show there were 980 incidents of fly-tipping reported in 201415 rising to 1,351 in 20162017.When Conwy announced the move to monthly collections, the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health warned of the potential risks. Weekly bin rounds have all but disappeared in Britain. At least another 20 local authorities, including several in Greater Manchester, North Devon and Leicestershire, have already imposed or are considering three-weekly bin collections.          Weekly bin rounds have all but disappeared in Britain‘We cannot hide our disappointment at this retrograde step,’ said Tony Lewis, policy chief of the institute, which represents 8,000 public health staff in charge of controlling local pollution and hygiene.‘There are real risks with moving to a monthly collection system, such as elevated levels of fly-tipping, domestic refuse burning, pest infestations, odour nuisance and fly nuisance, especially in the summer months.’ But a spokeswoman for the council told the Mail there were no such issues in Conwy, saying there would only be problems with smells or rodents if householders recycled food waste incorrectly. She said the number of reports of rats to the council had declined in the past year.          Sue organising a vast array of recycling receptacles outside her detached homeAs for fly-tipping, she also denied this was linked to the changes to bin collections, saying that tonnages of fly-tipped waste had not dramatically increased.Maybe that’s because some householders have decided to look for other, costly, alternatives.Binzilla, a private company that charges £8.99 to empty your wheelie bin, claims to now have customers running into the ‘high hundreds’ in the area.‘We have been working in Conwy since about January when they were on a three-week cycle and people were already struggling. Then they started making noises about four-week collection and our phone didn’t stop ringing,’ said managing director Yousef Ayub.‘We send trucks in to that area of North Wales from Manchester two times a week and don’t have spare capacity on the days we go.‘We are now adding an extra route with a view to basing two trucks in North Wales permanently.’ With some customers opting to have their bin emptied every week, that’s a cost of almost £500 a year. Of course, for most people that is simply not an option.And even if it were, given that an average Band D property in this area pays £1,469 a year in council tax, paying for a service they have already paid for would be hard to swallow.          At least another 20 local authorities, including several in Greater Manchester, North Devon and Leicestershire, have already imposed or are considering three-weekly bin collections‘Where does all our council tax go so they can only manage one collection a month?’ is a frequent complaint I hear on my rounds.Many point the finger of blame at the council’s new HQ in Colwyn Bay. The payment plan for the property, which will house 700 staff, will cost taxpayers at least £58 million in rent over 40 years.‘The really sad thing is that the £390,000 the council save per annum from reducing bin collections wouldn’t even pay one third of the annual rent on their new HQ being built at the moment,’ observed one online poster.‘Bravo Conwy Council, you’ve properly got it wrong this time!’The council defends itself saying that the new offices will enable it to work ‘smartly and more efficiently for the people of Conwy, creating a 21st-century council with services and infrastructure to match’.Questions have also been raised about what the council is going to do with all the extra recycled material. The estimated savings were based, in part, on selling more recyclable materials.But a decision by China to ban imports of waste plastic means huge backlogs are building up and the value of the waste, which would normally be sold to recycling companies, has collapsed.As a result several councils have given up on collecting and recycling plastic separately, which means an increasing amount is being burned for energy, or buried in landfill. Others are stockpiling it in vast dumps visible from space.I put this question to the council. The spokeswoman said that thus far they had not experienced any issues with a ‘lack of capacity’ for recycling collected in Conwy.She added that if residents are recycling properly ‘most households’ will have enough space in their black bins for rubbish and that surveys during the trial found only 2.2 per cent of bins had raised lids. This, it was claimed, ‘clearly shows that the vast majority of residents in the four-weekly collection trial area had sufficient space in their black wheelie bins’.Meanwhile, Andrew Wilkinson, Head of Neighbourhood Services for the council, added: ‘For most people in Conwy County four-weekly bin collections are no problem, just the next logical step towards a less throw-away society.‘More people are recycling and, thanks to TV programmes such as Blue Planet and campaigns such as the Mail’s “Turn the Tide on Plastic”, people are thinking more about what happens to waste.‘None of us want plastic ending up in landfill or the ocean, so why would we give people unlimited opportunity to throw away plastic in their wheelie bin, instead of recycling it?’It’s a fair enough question. But among those who pay his wages there will also be no shortage of people who will also question whether the methods employed in Conwy are in fact the best way of achieving those aims. "},{"url":null,"title":"QUENTIN LETTS years Remembrance ritual brings quaver voice","story":"    This arrangement - Heckington 100, from in Lincolnshire - commemorates the 31 men from the village who died in the First World War.

How much longer, as a country, will we continue to mourn casualties of a war that is now as distant from us as the Battle of Waterloo was from them?Is ‘mourning’ even the right word for what we do with our red poppies and our rolls of honour? Or is this something more deeply rooted?Remembrance Day chimes with the British autumn. The dolefulness of this Sunday’s civic gatherings around the country will be matched by November’s leaf-fall and a general dankness in the air.It is a day for greatcoats and hats and the stamp of black shoes on cold flagstones and gravel paths, when a smell of soil and decay is on the churchyard breeze.That the Great War ended on November 11 was strategic happenstance, but the date — the 11th of the 11th — had a poetry to it and it pretty much coincided with the ancient festivals of Hallowe’en and All Souls’ Day.          Grassmoor Craft Group in Derbyshire displayed nearly 2,000 poppies in the heart of the village, commemorating the end of WW1 From earliest times this was when the Celtic inhabitants of our isles contemplated death and those they had lost. I have never been to a Remembrance Service in the southern hemisphere, where it is springtime and Nature is bursting out all over, but it must have a very different flavour.How do you spend Poppy Day? Do you attend your local parade or do you watch TV coverage of the national ceremony in London, where the Queen and her prime ministers, present and past, lay wreaths at the Cenotaph?I went to the London event once, to stand in the crowds on Parliament Square and watch the old soldiers march past, elderly men still bristling with comradely pride. It gave one a rare sense of nationhood and of what the Armed Forces do for our parliamentary kingdom.Ex-Paratrooper, 62, goes on hunger strike until Remembrance...\u0027I was expecting rum, I got a Jägerbomb!\u0027 Hilarious moment...Strict school that banned \u0027Meet Me At McDonald\u0027s\u0027 haircuts...Share this articleMost years, though, I have spent Remembrance Day at ceremonies in Gloucestershire and Herefordshire. The hymns reach into our innards: Abide With Me, O Valiant Hearts or Parry’s setting of the Tennyson poem Crossing The Bar.Laurence Binyon’s words, ‘they shall grow not old as we that are left grow old’, catch the theft of youth from those who died in war and those of us now being bent by age.There is the march-past by the local branch of the Royal British Legion, medals swinging on lapels and veterans juddering to attention in defiance of the years. That these veterans include familiar faces — neighbours suddenly transformed by wearing their old colours — accentuates the Forces’ local links.          This tribute features 662 hand knitted and named poppies on crosses now installed in front of Worthing Town Hall thanks to the talented ladies of Storm MinistriesThe dead come often from the county regiments. From the war memorial lists you hear local surnames — in our part of Herefordshire six members of the Lee family, still prominent in the village — and that makes the years telescope and 20th century sacrifices seem closer.Then comes the two-minute silence, when all you can hear is the wind at your ears and the occasional sniffle from someone who has found it all too much. The Last Post may be trumpeted less than faultlessly, but the blend of earnest imperfection and shared solemnity can be immensely powerful.So many of those who died were just farmhands from nearby fields, unsuspecting lads who exchanged spades and ploughs for rifles and howitzers.           Pre-School children listening to a story about why we mark the 11th November with poppies.  All the children and staff were involved in making the poppies for the display at Humpty Dumpty Day Nurseries \u0026amp Pre-Schools in LichfieldSome people find Remembrance Day too militaristic. They are entitled to their view, but there is a difference between enlightened patriotism, which is a fine thing, and triumphant nationalism, which has no place at any church service or, for that matter, elsewhere.In the list of fallen former pupils that I read every year, there is one, Ahrens, who was a German who died while fighting against us.He may have been ‘the enemy’, yet we honour him as an equal before God, a man no less patriotic and unfortunate than our British troops. War is hellish for both sides.          The people of Clowne, Derbishire,  have crafted a poppy display to adorn their memorial wheel as the centenary approaches in coming days On Sunday, the President of Germany, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, will lay a wreath at the Cenotaph. Some who lived through the war are opposed to his presence. I, born post-war, can only welcome it as a further moment of reconciliation between us.Then there are those who choose to wear pacifist white poppies. Intellectually I might question their stance — are they saying they would never fight evil? — but emotionally it is hard to condemn their idealism. What did our grandfathers fight for, particularly in the war against Hitler, if not the right to hold contrary views?My mother, in her 80s, finds it harder to bite her tongue about pacifism. Her father was a British Army sapper who landed at D-Day and dashingly fought his way east through to Germany, running into a few lumps of shrapnel en route. He died in 1949, partly of his wounds, and my mother’s childhood was wrecked by that war.          This display at Blackpool\u0027s Victoria Hospital in Lancashire features a replica of the Menin Gate draped with knitted poppiesRemembrance Sunday is not easy for her, yet she stands with her gloved hands gripped tight, defying the raw memories that must make her want to gasp. The formality of Remembrance Sunday’s ceremonial, with its spare, stark words and its wind- whistling silence, is very British in its emotional restraint.Do WE romanticise those and other wars? Do we cast back longingly to a less complicated time, when stalwart women and men did not hesitate to make sacrifices for king and country?It seems we mark the day more now than 30 years ago. Amid today’s zingy restlessness maybe Remembrance Day reflects a need for occasional acts of communal melancholy.There must come a time when we will place less emphasis on the world wars and focus instead on loved ones we have lost in the previous year. I can see it would make sense for Remembrance Sunday eventually to become an All Souls Sunday. But I don’t sense that moment has yet arrived.A hundred years on, the story of the Western Front continues to grip our imagination. So, on Sunday, I will recite once again that sorrowful list of the unforgotten fallen whom we never knew. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b596eb3d4c2e9ac84dfa8e6d780a84cffff189c8/0_1456_14620_8768/master/14620.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=918431bc2be55baeb86194e9a556772e","title":"major van gogh exhibition to be held at londons tate britain in 2019","story":"Sunflowers, Self-Portrait and Starry Night Over the Rhône among works to be shownTate Britain is to hold its first Vincent van Gogh exhibition since a 1947 show that was so wildly popular that the gallery’s floors were damaged.“I think our floors are more robust these days,” said Alex Farquharson, Tate Britain’s director, as details were announced of the major 2019 show, which will explore Van Gogh’s relationship with Britain and his impact on British painters in new ways.Last time, people queued in the cold and rain to see a five-week long exhibition organised by the Arts Council of Great Britain.Over 157,000 people came to the show, including the Queen. Newspapers compared the scenes with the queues outside food stores during rationing – “And now they queue to see paintings” – putting the exhibition’s success down to people being “colour-starved” by the austerity of postwar Britain.Tate has discovered in its archive a letter to the Arts Council requesting reimbursement for three years’ worth of damage to its floors over the five weeks. A reply has not been found.Many of the visitors had never visited an art gallery before and they came even though it cost a shilling to get in on weekdays. That raised £3,000, one newspaper reported. Around half the total visitors came at weekends, when it was free.Tate said it was bringing more than 45 Van Gogh works to the new exhibition, the largest group of works by the artist to be seen in the UK for nearly a decade.The exhibition will tell the story of the young Vincent, an economic migrant who lived in London between 1873-76 as a trainee art dealer. He lodged in Brixton and fell in love with the city, walking everywhere.Important loans will include Self-Portrait 1889 from the National Gallery of Art in Washington Starry Night over the Rhône 1888 from the Musee d’Orsay in Paris and Prisoners Exercising 1890 from the Pushkin in Moscow.Closer to home will be the loan by the National Gallery of one of its superstars, Sunflowers 1888, one of only four paintings by Van Gogh of the subject which still exist.It will be a homecoming of sorts: Sunflowers hung at the Tate for four decades before a change in its remit saw the painting sent to the National Gallery in 1961.Curator Carol Jacobi said people had always “understood its importance, its magic”. It was first shown in London in 1910, lent from the personal collection of the artist’s sister-in-law Johanna van Gogh-Bonger who wanted British viewers to see Van Gogh’s very best work.It returned in 1923, shown at Tate alongside The Bedroom and The Yellow House. All three were determinedly not for sale despite Tate’s entreaties.Van Gogh-Bonger’s resolve eventually softened. In a letter to be featured in the show, she wrote: “I know that no picture would represent Vincent in your famous gallery in a more worthy manner than the ‘Sunflowers’ and that he … would have liked it to be there … It is a sacrifice for the sake of Vincent’s glory.”Sunflowers will be shown at Tate Britain alongside British artwork inspired by it, including paintings by artists including Christopher Wood, Jacob Epstein and Frank Brangwyn.• Van Gogh and Britain at Tate Britain, 27 March-11 August 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d33e2cbb6d2170cd0fb88496f5b4cd7976117b98/77_152_1267_760/master/1267.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dbfd6b6c4405e911ccd5106b46d1258","title":"the fashion photography of marilyn stafford in pictures","story":"As a freelance photojournalist based in Paris in the 1950s and early 1960s, Stafford covered fashion assignments from the established haute couture houses of the 50s to the birth of prêt-à-porter, moving to London in the 60s -where as one of a small number of female photographers she helped to pave the way for future women working on Fleet Street"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b90d5b97037aca170ca29ccfa527c663c7a3b47/0_50_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=978419049b4a08a63961a82d5a44015d","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of themWelcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:Sometimes good books can be found in unusual places, as tommydog shows:I was up in the mountains fishing and on the cabin’s bookshelf was We Pointed Them North: Recollections of a Cow Puncher by EOC Abbott, aka Teddy Blue Abbott. It turned out to be a fun read and rather interesting. A friend, Helena Smith, basically wrote the book from Teddy’s dictation, poor grammar and all. He wanted to set the record straight in the late 1930s that while life on the post Civil War frontier was hard, it was also a lot of fun…It was a fun book, ideally suited to nights in a mountain cabin. In some of it you can see the source of countless western themes. Other aspects of life on the 19th century ranches are surprising (roller skating for example).Astonishing. Just in case you were wondering, here’s a definition of “cowpuncher”. (It isn’t someone who goes around thumping cows.)On the subject of frontiers, Dennis89 has been “thoroughly enjoying” The Worst Journey in the World by Apsley Cherry-Garrard:A monumental account of Scott’s tragic 1912 expedition to the South Pole. Since starting this book I feel that my concentration at work has waned... My thoughts keep ferrying me off to the wonder, beauty and isolation of Antarctica. I walk home from work eager to get back into that world of crevasses, comradeship, endeavour and altruism. Yes, there are the formidable details of the journeys undertaken and the conditions experienced but the real joy lies within the description of the human relationships that are formed in such a hostile and unforgiving environment.But humans aren’t always so noble. William Golding’s Lord Of The Flies has brought back memories for quickspace:Just read Lord of the Flies for the first time, finishing it yesterday with the horror of boyhood re-emerging 41 years later, the panic and cruelty boys inflict on each other. Having gone to an all boys school after flunking my 11+, the hierarchy and mob mentality felt familiar, though I don’t think anyone was brutally murdered by a mob or had their brains bashed out by a fuck-off rock. Oddly, the description of Simon’s corpse reminded me the description of Curly’s wife after her death in Of Mice ... At least in tone, curiously poetic and so sad I bawled my eyes out, which I’m glad happened now and not in my school days.The Portable Dorothy Parker, “a collection of her short stories, poems, reviews and personal correspondence” has impressed JohnHunt:Everything in the book is short, though the book itself runs to just over 600 pages … Like Runyon, Parker is very much of time and place and, again like Runyon, the time runs from the 1920s to the early 1950s and the place is New York and its environs. Parker knows her characters and she’s betting that you have a passing familiarity with them as well. Her stories are told from an unapologetically female perspective, often a woman’s internal dialogue. If you appreciate a good zinger at the end, if you need someone who’s quotes you will be able to recall at just the right moments, if you are looking for a good laugh or a way to consider the female perspective from her time period, Parker is your sure guide.Parker also wrote A Star Is Born if you’re wondering if she is still relevant today. You just can’t go wrong.Anna Burns’ Milkman has worked for chasm:I’m surprised by the reviews that described it as a difficult read, I thought it pretty accessible. I also thought it the best Booker winner for some years, original, thought-provoking, humane, and unputdownable.Meanwhile, jinxsboy51 recommends The Butchering Art: Joseph Lister’s Quest to Transform the Grisly World of Victorian Medicine by Lindsey Fitzharris:Very readable history of the transformation that occurred in medicine about the role of infection and sterilisation in making a big difference in surgery survival rates. NOT for the those with queasy stomachs.Finally, talking of stomachs, annegeraldine has been focussing on Thackeray’s Vanity Fair:The men have gone off to battle in Waterloo leaving Amelia a pitiful wreck and Becky planning her strategy should she be widowed. Joseph Sedley remains with the women: “At half-past two, an event occurred of daily importance to Mr Joseph -- the dinner-hour arrived. Warriors may fight and perish, but he must dine.”If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

New roles will be oriented towards digital technology.It is understood that existing Lloyds employees whose jobs disappear will be offered the chance to apply for the new roles, fitting in with an existing re-training drive.Lloyds’ recognised unions, Unite and Accord, have been consulted on the plans, which are not thought to include branch closures at this point, although job losses may be concentrated in specific offices.A Unite spokesperson said: “Unite will scrutinise the detail of the announcement when it is made. Our priority will be to press the company to ensure there are no compulsory redundancies.”Lloyds, which owns brands such as Halifax and Bank of Scotland, announced in February it would re-evaluate its strategy alongside a £3bn investment plan running from 2018 to 2020. At the same time, it is aiming to cut operating costs to less than £8bn in 2020, from £8.2bn in 2017.The UK’s major high street banks have been gradually reducing branch numbers as they adjust to the rapid rise of mobile and online banking and the consequent slump in the number of branch transactions.Lloyds announced 15 branch closures in September, although job losses were not significant. However, it has cut thousands of jobs under the leadership of the chief executive, António Horta Osório, who joined the bank in 2011.The bank previously said its “transformation” programme would affect more than two-thirds of the business.The restructuring plan came after the government sold off its final shares in the bank. Lloyds was bailed out by the government during the financial crisis, following the acquisition of HBOS which made it into the UK’s largest high street bank.Lloyds Banking Group declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/043bf099de8a1e6a2f62cd273ea1a053594d4838/35_148_1640_984/master/1640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50ff3f5e053119946e11ae3c5985d904","title":"pro europe mps brexit conmen","story":"Remainers who settle for a half-baked deal will be blamed for the mess that followsBrexit expresses a part of what it means to be British, albeit not the part anyone who campaigned for it had in mind. It is the national tendency to find satisfaction in being dissatisfied. It is the spirit of picnics in the rain and self-congratulation for having stuck with a plan long after it stopped making sense.It looks increasingly plausible that Theresa May will complete a deal that pleases no one and is approved by parliament anyway. The outline is coming into focus. To keep the Irish border friction-free, the UK will be locked into maximal regulatory alignment with Brussels. There will be some dodgy escape clause, sold to Tory Eurosceptics as a future portal to the mythical global trade utopia of Canada-plus.That model would be too soft for the hard nuts and too hard for the softies. It would launch the UK into an outer-European orbit without a seat at mission control. It would be worse than EU membership, but less wantonly self-destructive than breaking off the talks and running at next March’s cliff edge. Some Tory cliff-jumpers (with their own private financial parachutes) will reject any deal. Their number is uncertain but probably enough for Downing Street to need votes from Labour MPs who like neither Brexit nor May. Why should they, or the pro-European Tories who agree with them, bail the prime minister out? The answer is fear – of no-deal chaos and of constituents who just want out no quibbling over terms and conditions.The sole merit in May’s model will be its availability. It will be an Angus Steakhouse of Brexits – the uninspiring place you end up in because it’s there, and you’re hungry and tired of walking in circles looking for an elusive destination to satisfy everyone in your party. The alternative is to hold out for something better at the risk of getting something worse. Here the pro-European camp splits. On one side are those who say the only way to avoid the pointless cost of Brexit is by calling it off, which requires another referendum. On the other side are those who see the social impact of a referendum as costlier than the economic hit of an orderly Brexit. They flinch at the thought of a campaign that, judging by recent precedent, would be neither civil, nor decisive.This debate among former remainers is now the most important battle in British politics, and it transcends traditional party allegiance. It centres not on whether leaving the EU is a good idea but on whether it has to be done anyway, in diluted form, as the fare for moving the nation on. The dilemma: gamble on a people’s vote, reigniting a horrible culture war with no guarantee of victory, or concede defeat with the consolation prize of a customs union.Another referendum is a tough sell when people can still taste the bitterness of the last one. Yes, there is a difference between a leap in the dark and informed consent based on a concrete proposal. The 2016 poll was held in a fog of ignorance and misinformation. Allegations of fraud in the financing of the pro-Brexit machine are reason enough for some to demand a rematch. But the reluctant Brexiters worry that remain arguments still sound condescending to many leavers’ ears. The remain message is vulnerable to caricature as a sneer that stupid racists got the question wrong and must resit the exam until they give the right answer.Millions of voters saw Brexit as a once-per-generation demand for change, unique and irreversible. If MPs are thinking of reversing it, they’d better have a bloody good sense of what they are offering instead. Anything that looks like restoration of a Westminster ancien régime could stoke a rage to shake the foundations of British democracy.But a backlash is not averted by going through with Brexit. There is no chance of May’s deal meeting every (or any) advertised benefit of quitting the EU, so those who missold the adventure will start parcelling out blame, directing none at themselves. Remainers might fear reopening painful isions, but Brexiteers have shown no interest in national healing. Theirs is the Trumpesque politics of salting wounds and scoring the howls of pain into nationalist marching songs.Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Nigel Farage, Arron Banks – these are cowards who flee responsibility for decisions they urge on others. They long ago renounced ownership of any practical Brexit outcome. It was never their intention to preside over the enactment of their mendacious campaigns and it is not their intention to lay down arms once the UK is out of the EU. They look forward to the day when May’s model has failed so they can steer the ensuing grievance towards scapegoats closer to home than Brussels.Here, then, are some questions for pro-Europeans who do not want to face the Brexit conmen in another referendum: do you really think Johnson-Faragism is an unbeatable proposition or will you dare to take it on? When? If you surrender the trench of EU membership, where do you retreat to fight again? If you let Brexit pass because you were afraid to argue from principle that it is a mistake, what will your argument be when the mistake is found out?The temptation to settle for anything the prime minister brings home will be great. The lure of a return to politics that isn’t about Europe is strong. It is also a mirage. Hard leavers will hate May’s deal, but they will be relaxed if former remainers want to pull the trigger that kills EU membership. Those suckers will own the terms of Brexit without ever having believed in the goal. Then the people who should most take responsibility for the mess that follows will laugh as they heap blame on the MPs who thought it was a bad idea and, for reasons history will struggle to admire, did it anyway."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/409453f0a21d9ac60da25af2366bbce9460f997d/0_56_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=478d208c9041f91bc3b605438745cddb","title":"something is wrong with journalism andrew marr arron banks interview","story":"The ground between truth and lies has become increasingly muddy. Marr’s failure to press Banks shows the media has not caught up with this realityHaving watched Andrew Marr interview Arron Banks on his BBC show on Sunday, I agree with those who thought the journalist’s approach was not the best way to probe him. Banks got his 30-second soundbite in first and, once again, the BBC was played. Something has gone very wrong with my profession in this country, as it has in the US.The deference to Trump that so many journalists also display to Steve Bannon and his ilk rests on an idea that has to be contested: that there is truth and there are lies and that the job of a journalist is simply to reveal the lies and – hallelujah! – everything will change. This is patently not working. Trump supporters know he lies and they don’t care. They will counter this by saying the media lies about him.Remainers keep banging on to leavers that they were lied to, that a slogan on a bus was a lie. Again, they believe the reciting of this fact will change minds. But no. Of course, people who have lived in Russia have warned us about this for a long time. It is possible to exist in alternative realities, to muddy the ground between truth and lies. It is possible to think two things at the same time. It is possible to know you are being lied to and not to mind that much, as it is par for the course.To counter this, we have to hit back at the level of emotional truth after all, this is what Facebook ads were said to be doing – appealing to people’s emotional understanding of the world. The BBC, in particular, has been completely unfit for purpose and the Ukippy right wing has run circles around it. The mantra of impartiality has permitted the amplification of untruths.

It’s important,” the feminist writer and activist Caroline Criado Perez told the Observer earlier this year. A few days later, the statue of the suffragist Millicent Fawcett that she had campaigned for was unveiled in Parliament Square, where it joined 11 statues of men. Almost a year earlier, a statue of the Crimean war nurse Mary Seacole was unveiled in the gardens of St Thomas’ hospital, half a mile away on the opposite side of the Thames. Then, in September last year, a new £10 note went into circulation featuring the novelist Jane Austen – following another campaign by Ms Criado Perez, who threatened to take the Bank of England to court after it decided to replace an image of the prison reformer Elizabeth Fry with Winston Churchill, meaning that there would have been no women represented on British money – apart from the Queen.Efforts at boosting women’s representation on monuments and in public spaces are not confined to London. Campaigners in Dorset are fundraising for a statue of the fossil hunter Mary Anning in Lyme Regis. A statue of the suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst will be unveiled in Manchester in December. In York, a consultation is under way with a view to changing the wording on a rainbow plaque celebrating the diarist Anne Lister, so that she is described as a lesbian. Not everyone is convinced that such undertakings are worth the effort and the money, particularly at a time when so many women have been affected by reductions in public spending. Analysis of tax and benefit changes last year found that government cuts have cost women £79bn since 2010, against £13bn for men. Despite the introduction of new rules for reporting on the gender pay gap, the gulf between men’s and women’s hourly pay has not shrunk for three years. Meanwhile the hopes raised by #MeToo, that violence and harassment of women in the workplace could be dramatically reduced, have faded. Haven’t feminists got more serious battles to fight than over statues and banknotes, it has been asked. Other voices question whether it is even desirable to perpetuate a model whereby prominent iniduals and their deeds are celebrated, while more ordinary lives and struggles are forgotten.But representation is important, perhaps particularly to children in the process of forming their ideas about the world, and themselves. Positive role models – in real life or bronze – won’t eliminate inequality. But it makes a difference to all of us who we see on plinths, screens, stamps and coins. That’s why it matters that women of all sorts – black, white, lesbian, trans, disabled – are represented in all sorts of ways, in all sorts of places."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c555b01b6c8f21124bca393d582e629c4a41599/81_173_4726_2835/master/4726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94f203e22901ac1fb560a9d4dc496381","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of miniature","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘miniature’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment in the Observer New Review is ‘miniature’.

Phasing them out could avoid as much as 0.5C (0.9F) of warming this century.Over the southern hemisphere and in the more problematic polar regions, recovery will take longer, until the middle of this century in the former and about 2060 in the latter case.The results, presented on Monday in a four-year assessment of the health of the ozone layer, represent a rare instance of global environmental damage being repaired, and a victory for concerted global action by governments. Scientific evidence of the depletion of the ozone layer over the Antarctic was first presented in 1985, and in 1987 the Montreal protocol was signed, binding world governments to reduce and phase out the harmful chemicals identified as causing the problem.Ozone in the upper layers of the atmosphere protects the earth’s surface from most of the harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun. Without it, skin and eye damage can occur, and evidence suggests a rise in skin cancers associated with the thinning of the ozone layer.“The Montreal protocol is one of the most successful multilateral agreements in history for a reason,” said Erik Solheim, head of UN Environment. “The careful mix of authoritative science and collaborative action that has defined the protocol for more than 30 years and was set to heal our ozone layer is precisely why the Kigali amendment holds such promise for climate action in future.”The Kigali amendment to the Montreal protocol, coming into effect at the start of next year, will help reduce future climate change, by targeting HFC gases, mostly used in refrigeration, which have a warming effect tens of thousands of times greater than carbon dioxide.Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, said: “Over the last three decades, the Montreal protocol has fulfilled its original objective to heal the ozone layer. But it didn’t stop there. Because CFCs and related gases are also super climate pollutants, phasing them out has reduced the climate problem by an amount that would have equalled the contribution of carbon dioxide today – more than half of all warming – with the Kigali amendment adding even more climate protection.”Until recently, most major sources of ozone-harming gases were thought to have been closed down, until studies showed sites in China where gases were still emerging. The Chinese government has pledged to find and close down these sites."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c54120c9883cb8d94331aa331621058238259a53/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed56c208f6c7798f4d4643a443fce50d","title":"sperm whales canadian arctic","story":"Rare sighting in the Canadian Arctic as a growing number of species expand their range into warming waters A rare sighting of sperm whales in the Canadian Arctic is the latest sign of a quickly changing ecosystem, say scientists, as a growing number of species expand their range into warming Arctic waters.Brandon Laforest, a marine biologist with the World Wildlife Fund, and guide Titus Allooloo were working on a project monitoring the effect of marine traffic on the region’s narwhal population when they spotted the pair of large whales just outside Pond Inlet, a community at the northern tip of Baffin Island in September.Video of the incident, released at the end of October, captures the second known sighting of sperm whales in the region. In 2014, hunters from Pond Inlet spotted them in the area.At first, Allooloo and Laforest thought the dark shapes in the water were killer whales – another species that has become a frequent visitor to the waters as temperatures creep up. But the distinct shape of the dorsal fin surprised Allooloo – a veteran hunter.“They’re not known by us, we don’t know too much about them,” Allooloo told the CBC.While a number of whales species thrive year-round in the Arctic, including beluga, bowhead and narwhal, the physiology of a sperm whale makes it difficult for them to navigate colder waters.Their heads and upper parts of the body are soft and contain an oily fat – long prized by whalers – that turns waxy in cold waters. Their bodies – which can weigh as much as 125,000lb (56,700kg) – are also ineffective at breaking through ice.While they don’t represent a threat to the ecosystem, there are worries sperm whale could become trapped as winter approaches.“Inexperienced whales exploiting a northern habitat may not know to leave early enough before the sea ice forms,” Laforest told the CBC.The vast area of the Arctic waters – estimated by Canadian researchers to measure 5.5m sq miles - makes it difficult for scientists to effectively track changes in the ecosystem, including the arrival of previously unreported species.Baseline datasets are also rare, making trend gathering difficult. Increasingly, researchers are working with Inuit communities, which have a long oral history of species in the region.In recent years, killer whales, or orcas, have also become more frequent in a number, taking advantage of longer ice-free seasons. The whales, which feast on resident narwhal, have even started changing narwhal behaviour, according to a 2017 report by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.“I think the narwhal are scared to death,” report co-author Steve Ferguson told the Canadian Press. “Watching your brother or sister or mother get killed and eaten by a killer whale would cause a little post-traumatic stress in most of us.”A recent presentation by the department also highlighted a spike in chum salmon populations the western Arctic – in numbers far greater than previously recorded.Warming temperatures have also prompted interest in the potential for expanded commercial fishing in the Arctic. In response, nine countries have agreed to ban fishing in the region until a more thorough study of the ecosystem can be completed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fd26645e1a00b2b637181af08e3003449ed8563/0_75_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5484cded5bf114ea6ce43308c64bd53e","title":"how to eat chicken soup","story":"As autumn begins to bite, How to Eat is cooking up a hearty, rugged broth with, of course, bread and butter on the side. Is there any other way to enjoy it?The big coats are out and the nights are drawing in. Winter is coming. It is time to seek comfort in warming, hearty one-pots – and, in particular, the restorative power of chicken soup.The jury is very much out on whether the subject of this month’s How to Eat (HTE) might “do stuff” to you medicinally – the so-called Jewish penicillin likely exerts a strong placebo effect – but as we shiver through chilly commutes, hacking and coughing our way towards Christmas, arriving home to a steaming bowl of chicken soup indisputably lifts the soul.That bone broth warms the marrow. But only if it is done properly, which is where HTE – the series examining how best to eat Britain’s favourite dishes – comes in. So what is the ultimate expression of chicken soup?For sanity’s sake, this piece will limit itself to chicken soup prepared in a broadly European and North American style. Not out of chauvinism, much less xenophobia. But simply because exploring the full panoply of Asian, African and Latin American chicken soups in a way that does them justice would make this article balloon into an unmanageable, indigestible sprawl. An epic so vast it would make War and Peace (that “loose, baggy monster”, as Henry James put it) look like an offhand tweet.Bits. It should have bits in it. This broth should be dense, with visible pieces of chicken, vegetables, pulses and pasta. You may not be able to stand your spoon in it, but your spoon should definitely encounter some firm resistance. That heft, that ruggedness is central to this soup’s ability to banish the blues – both in the solidity and safety it suggests, and in the textural and flavour variation it provides in each mouthful. You need to chew here. Think of it as rewarding work. Eating chicken soup should feel like you are taking on a hot, generously filling fuel, laying down essential fat and protein for the cruel winter ahead (hence a gelatinous bone-broth base, speckled with globules of fat, is preferable).Chicken soup should never be smooth. Cream of chicken soup, that pallid, sweet concoction – that looks more like a milkshake and in which the chicken meat has invariably gone AWOL – is utterly childish. It may sound more sophisticated, but chicken soup given the velouté treatment is similarly vapid. A velouté might be a smart way to showcase a single vegetable (say, Jerusalem artichoke), but its silky mouthfeel is jarring in a context where you want body, chunks, meat. Similarly, there is something eerie about clear chicken consommés. That is an awful lot of cheffy work for a soup that will leave any right-thinking diner asking: where’s the rest of it? It is as if someone has stolen, if not chicken soup’s soul, then its crown jewels.Soup served in a cup will always, as Danny Dyer might put it, leave you feeling mugged off. The idea that all soups should be blended into a smoothly drinkable texture is infantile, and there is something about hurriedly slurping down gulps of warm, viscous savoury liquid (in contrast to the way a spoon moderates the pace of consumption) that is actively nauseating.Ideally, chicken soup should be served in a wide, deep bowl and consumed with a round soup spoon (using an oval dessert spoon, on the basis that it is more elegant, is a real Hyacinth Bucket move). Such a bowl retains its heat, acts as a reassuring visual representation of how thoroughly your hunger will be sated and gives you plenty of space to root around.Likewise, there is no practical reason to tilt the bowl away from you as you finish the last dregs of your soup, other than as some coded middle-class signalling to people around the table that you too unthinkingly adhere to petty bourgeois niceties. It is awkward nonsense. Ignore it.Apart from the chicken, which is firm enough that it can overhang the edges slightly, everything should be chopped into small enough pieces that a few of them can comfortably nestle together in each spoonful. Including long, floppy strands of difficult to control ingredients (spaghetti, flat noodles, cabbage etc) will likely leave you wearing half of your soup. In a noodle soup, you sign up for that it is a different proposition. But in chicken soup, keep it tidy. For instance, use smaller pastina (orzo, anelli, sorprese).Real pieces of chicken This may sound obvious, but it is a suggestion widely ignored by many commercial manufacturers of canned and fresh soups. Get some darker meat in there for additional flavour and do not shred the chicken. In a soup, shredded chicken becomes waterlogged and woolly. Instead, cut it into firmer chunks.Vegetables Onion, sweetcorn, celery, carrot, cabbage (darker, challenging varieties, for example, kale), celeriac, parsnip. Feel free to char or part-roast some of those vegetables first to build in further layers of flavour.Chorizo Used sparingly as a seasoning (this is not chicken and ham soup), a small amount goes a long way.Bulking agents A scattering of chickpeas, rice, redyellow lentils, pasta or barley (perhaps even a mix of several of these) will add textural variety, a satisfying bottom-end weight and further nutty, iron-y flavours.Cream Just a drop or two, swirled through.Turkey The most disappointing meat on the market: accept no imitations.Bacon Unless safely marooned on a central island of ingredients, above the waterline and used strictly as a garnish, bacon becomes curiously mealy in soups. Likewise, chicken crackling: if immersed in all that liquid, it ends up not crisp and salty, but unedifyingly soggy and slimy.Mushrooms In a chicken pie, all good, but in a hot soup, the flavour of mushrooms is muffled and, like leeks, they achieve an altogether unpleasant level of slipperiness. Needless to say, even before we get to the issue of including prunes in a savoury soup (ye gods!), HTE is not a fan of cock-a-leekie.Potato In a soup, chunks of potato are always either undercooked or mush. There is no in between. Moreover, in a soup in which you need to work hard to avoid blandness (see flavour boosters, below), potato is a noncommittal shrug of an ingredient that adds body without flavour.Broccoli Water gets trapped in the heads of the florets and superheats so that, even as the soup cools, those pieces of broccoli maintain a thermonuclear temperature that could strip fire-resistant paint from a garage door, never mind the roof of your mouth. Not that you are likely to use them here, but as a general warning, tomatoes pose a similar danger.Peas Pointless, in this context.Egg Which came first: chicken soup or the idea of gently cooking strands of egg through it? HTE cannot say, but it is an ineffectual and unnecessary addition.It is rare that HTE strays into the realms of seasoning specifics. The how-to-cook nitty gritty is Felicity Cloake’s domain. But is worth reiterating that from salt, pepper, garlic and white wine upwards, chicken soup benefits enormously from some added va va voom to lift its somewhat beige ingredients. The more obvious herbs (parsley, thyme, bayleaf) can be too domineering, but if judged correctly, a little heat (ginger, chilli) can bring everything into sharper focus. Masala spices, harissa or ras el hanout can also be effectively deployed, but that is to take chicken soup on its travels in a way that HTE promised to avoid at the top of this piece.Even when stuffed to the gills, wiping your bowl clean with a piece of thickly buttered bread is the pinnacle of the chicken soup experience. Mopping up every last drop of those magical savoury juices is a must – like an impromptu roast chicken sandwich at the end of your meal. Who could say no to that?Remarkably, many people swear by chicken soup as a hangover cure. In a fragile state, and certainly before midday, HTE could think of nothing worse. Even the thought of it makes HTE bilious.Chicken soup is even wasted at lunch, arguably. It is best eaten after dark, in deepest winter, when rain is lashing against the windows and, if only for a few hours, you are determined to hibernate from the world and its endless horrors. Self-care starts with chicken soup.So, chicken soup: how do you eat yours?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30136fc27b55e1cece78fb0d13980d04d5d88c6b/0_186_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=980\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94a6ba34974201b7bbb3fffac23815e8 980w","title":"chelsea alvaro morata goals injury mood","story":"• Morata now ‘very happy’ after five goals in six matches• Spanish forward says back injury took an emotional tollÁlvaro Morata has revealed his confidence hit rock bottom towards the end of his first season at Chelsea when his form fizzled out as he laboured with a back injury. But the Spain striker is now more at ease in body and mind and reaping the benefits.Two goals against Crystal Palace on Sunday swelled Morata’s recent tally to five in six matches, a burst more reminiscent of his prolific start at Stamford Bridge following a £58m transfer from Real Madrid in the summer of 2017. His previous 31 matches had yielded four goals after a back injury, which flared in January and initially baffled the medical staff, blunted his impact.The forward is now restored to fitness but a player whom Maurizio Sarri acknowledged as “fragile” after the weekend’s 3-1 win admits his real battle has been to recover mentally from last season’s toils.“The most important thing is that, finally, I have found the right way and my head is OK,” Morata said. “In football physical condition is veryimportant but the head is the most important thing.“If you don’t have the head, if the mentality is not good, then you are in trouble. I’m better.“No one, only my wife, knows how big the last year was. Now it’s OK. In the last month of last season I was down, down, down, down. I cannot be more down. When you touch the limit, the only thing you can do is to come back.“It takes long because I had an injury, I was not fit when playing, but now I feel good. I had a period where everything … if it was raining, I was angry because it’s raining if I miss, it’s because the pitch is too wet. It was only excuses. It is not good.“Honestly, last year I was always joking in the dressing room at the beginning because I started well and was scoring goals. But the injury, it killed me, because the doctors didn’t know what I had. It was strange. Sometimes when you know you are out for one month, it’s OK in your head, because you know it is one month. But when you are trying to give your best and you are not in your best moment, it’s difficult. Now, that’s the past.“Everyone can have a bad period in their life. But we are famous, we have a lot of things. Sometimes people think we are not human, with no feelings, with no problems. The important thing is to find the right balance.Morata, whose wife gave birth to twins in July, might have completed a hat-trick against Palace only to opt to chip Wayne Hennessey, at 6ft 6in, from close range after sprinting through on goal in stoppage time. “I suffered a lot in the past and needed to score three for myself, for my team and for the supporters,” he said. “It was very important for me. Honestly, I think I missed because I had only this in my head.“If I don’t think, probably I score. In the last 10 minutes I only have in my head ‘I want to bring the ball home’ and that’s why I missed. The goalkeeper did well. I thought he’d go down and I forgot he’s a keeper who is two metres tall and that’s why I failed. But I’m improving and this is the important thing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fe63beca2eccb5f2f395870b801b5a9553ba59b/0_112_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf1cb149442a715f7fea9155098e37d1","title":"england players wayne rooney farewell appearance","story":"• Record goalscorer to feature in friendly against the USA• Match will raise funds for Rooney’s charitable foundationEngland’s players were not consulted by Gareth Southgate over the plan to offer Wayne Rooney a farewell appearance for the team, with the manager still considering which shirt to allocate the forward in the friendly against the United States.Rooney will come out of international retirement to gain his 120th cap when he makes a brief substitute’s appearance at Wembley on 15 November. The Football Association has designated the game The Wayne Rooney Foundation International, with the 33-year-old’s foundation one of a number of charities which will benefit from the proceeds.England’s record goalscorer will be an additional selection on top of the squad Southgate would normally have selected and will announce on Thursday. The DC United striker will join up with the rest of the party at St George’s Park next week with England ostensibly using the USA match as preparation for their last, and potentially critical, Nations League tie against Croatia on 18 November.Rooney will have a cameo role in the friendly and it remains to be seen whether Southgate allows him to wear his usual No 10 shirt off the bench. The FA’s promotional imagery for the game – albeit for advertising purposes – have shown Rooney in the shirt he effectively inherited from Michael Owen and went on to wear for much of his 13-year England career, including the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, and European Championships in 2012 and 2016.Raheem Sterling, who scored twice in the impressive 3-2 win in Spain last month, is the current No 10 having worn the shirt at the World Cup in Russia. It remains to be seen whether Sterling will be selected against USA given the match’s proximity to the Croatia fixture. Yet the Manchester City forward, in scintillating form, would expect to be notified if Rooney were to reclaim the shirt, even as a one-off.Southgate is apparently aware that allowing Rooney to come off the bench wearing No 10 would prompt some raised eyebrows. England use allocated squad numbers only at major tournaments and, unlike other nations, line up 1-11 with replacements taking higher numbers. Rooney’s 118th cap, a goalless draw with Slovenia in Ljubljana, saw him come on for the last 17 minutes wearing No 18."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d0ca1d5a8ca71e837e48e984be461efd75fa64f/264_0_2546_1528/master/2546.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f4985d2d48dc46c5a944b9a8a1f2fb1","title":"huddersfield fulham premier league match report","story":"If good things are supposed to come to those who wait, few had waited longer than Huddersfield Town and few, as the roar at the John Smith’s Stadium at the final whistle showed, enjoyed their reward more. This was not just a first win of the season not when they had gone 205 days without scoring a home goal, a 659-minute barren streak that threatened to make them the wrong sort of history-makers. Instead that mantle settles on Fulham. As Huddersfield avoided the ignominy of joining the Mansfield team of 1971-72 as the only English sides to fail to score in the first six home games of a league season, Fulham equalled Southampton’s isional record by conceding 29 times in their first 11 games of a Premier League season.Yet while the statistical distinction is unwanted, Slavisa Jokanovic has more immediate concerns after Fulham’s worst start to a top-flight season deteriorated further. A sequence of six straight defeats imperils his position. With a trip to Liverpool next he may approach the international break with some trepidation.“I personally trust in myself,” said Jokanovic. But he accepted his fate depends on those who let him down on Monday night. “It is outside of my control,” added the Serb. “It is not only in my hands. Part of the job is in the hands of my players.” They conducted a post-match inquest in the dressing room. “My players have some words after the game but it is a little bit late then.”“Really sorry everyone” was the message on the club’s Twitter feed at the end. Such apologies were probably not envisaged when Fulham spent £100 million in the summer. This has the potential to be the most expensive relegation of them all and, given the resources, one of the more avoidable.Fulham have the talent but showed little of the character the victorious manager, David Wagner, identified in his Huddersfield side. “They seem to be a little bit scared,” Jokanovic admitted. “Maybe we didn’t understand how important this game is. We were a little bit confused. We didn’t play the first 45 minutes with enough intensity.” Perhaps his most remarkable admission about a side with footballing principles was: “We started to kick the ball without any sense.”Given Fulham’s self-destructive tendencies it was sadly symbolic that they donated the only goal, Timothy Fosu-Mensah being debited with Huddersfield’s winner. Thereafter it was indicative of their fortunes that Kevin McDonald, who came on in a half-time double switch, lasted only 20 minutes.Change is a constant. Jokanovic has named a different defence every game this season and is no nearer to finding a formula for clean sheets. Fosu-Mensah inadvertently applied the finishing touch when two Germans combined, Christopher Schindler meeting Chris Lowe’s cross, to make it a happy anniversary for a third. “Sometimes everything comes together,” said Wagner, who was tasked with avoiding relegation to League One when appointed in November 2015. “Three years I am here, this was my 50th win and for sure one of the most important because, after such a long period, you need this feeling.”The sensation of scoring at home was novel enough. Philip Billing had struck the bar with a thunderbolt and Alex Pritchard drew a fine save from Sergio Rico to add to their litany of near-misses. “If you hit the bar and post as often as we have, you think: ‘Come on, what is going on here?’ Huddersfield’s previous home goal came so long ago that the scorer, Thomas Ince, has since made 15 appearances for Stoke.While he has returned to the Championship Huddersfield approached their task in a manner to suggest they will not go down without a fight. “If you don’t bring passion and aggression you have no chance,” said Schindler. Huddersfield displayed both in considerable quantities. He, Billing and Aaron Mooy were outstanding. Their team mates were willing allies.“The guys delivered,” said Wagner. “We showed spirit and fighting intensity and in the second half, we were able to bring the result over the line. We know it is possible to deliver in big-pressure games.”Huddersfield have already won a relegation battle and limited Fulham to one shot on target. The beaten manager sought solace from the past after consulting last year’s league table. “After 11 games Crystal Palace had four points and didn’t get relegated,” Jokanovic observed. But, and while he did not mention it, only after changing their manager."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41784f234a957ef03f5ccf3fed1d911fe2113afa/0_369_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=758690c9ad892efb3c8c812bf6bf5bb0","title":"tottenham mauricio pochettino psv eindhoven house of cards","story":"The Tottenham manager has said the US political drama has similarities with life in football as his team prepare to face PSVIt has been a tortuous wait for Mauricio Pochettino, scarred by delays and problems with personnel but, at last, it has been delivered. The Tottenham manager could barely disguise his delight. Finally he has been able to binge on House of Cards season six.Pochettino loves the US presidential drama. The Netflix show features intrigue, deceit, ruthlessness and broken promises, with a fair few PR disasters thrown in. How could Pochettino possibly relate to that?“We’re having a weird season but I look so happy because I’ve started the new season of House of Cards. I watched three episodes on Monday. I’ve learned a lot from this series. I recommend it.”Pochettino has been bogged down by problems since the beginning of pre-season, with many of them linked to the delays in moving back to the rebuilt ground on the site of White Hart Lane. It is strange to think the club maintained for the whole of last season that the stadium would be ready in August. It will now be mid-January at the earliest.Spurs face PSV Eindhoven at Wembley on Tuesday night in an important Champions League Group B tie and it is vexing the pitch is in such poor condition, although Pochettino said it looked better than it did against Manchester City last Monday.Pochettino was reminded of the advertising slogan the club used at the start of the season. They had boasted the new ground would be “the only place to watch Champions League in London” – a dig at their rivals Arsenal and Chelsea, who reached only the Europa League. Spurs know that, in all probability, they will have to beat PSV and Internazionale at Wembley and then Barcelona at the Camp Nou to keep their Champions League campaign alive.“We’re all disappointed that we’re not playing Champions League in the new stadium but it wasn’t in our hands to deliver it,” Pochettino said. “When you build a house or an extension, it’s always difficult to say when it will be finished. We’ve had problems and it’s been delayed, delayed, delayed.It was noticeable Pochettino did not say “in the new stadium”. He had previously expressed the belief the club would be in situ by Christmas time. He is no longer making any predictions.Pochettino reported Dembélé, who injured an ankle at Wolves on Saturday, had avoided bone damage but may have a problem with the ligament. “We will know better after the scan,” Pochettino said.Wanyama got a knock at West Ham in the Carabao Cup last Wednesday to his good knee rather than the bad one.

Going forward, Mitrovic kept going, but they offered precious little, with André Schürrle missing what was probably their best chance, and it was hardly an open goal. It was in midfield where Fulham were really overruled Cairney was largely anonymous, while Seri and Anguissa went missing. Hogg and Billing ran the show. Next up for Fulham? A trip to Anfield on Sunday. For now, it doesn’t bear thinking about.Wagner is doing a lap of the pitch, basking in all of the applause thrown at him and his players.

The John Smith’s Stadium is rocking, and it’s the happiest of anniversaries of Wagner, who is celebrating three years in the job today. What now for Slavisa Jokanovic and his side? His Fulham side were simply not at that races from start to finish. Rico, the goalkeeper, and André Schürrle fall to their knees. For the hosts, a special mention for the central-midfield pairing of Jonathan Hogg and Philip Billing who made Cairney, Seri and co look plain ordinary.90+2 min: Bacuna revs up the home crowd.

Fulham are staring at sixth straight league defeat.85 min: Fulham dink the ball over the top of the Huddersfield defence in search of Mitrovic – but Lossl rushes out of goal to head the ball clear. And now Kongolo heads out Sessegnon’s deep cross for a corner. It’s kitchen-sink time.83 min: Mbenza’s involved straight away, but he really should do better. He shanks an effort painfully wide, after being slipped through on goal by Billing. As well as getting it all wrong, the loanee, only seconds after coming on, perhaps took it too early. Unfashionable, but Billing’s been superb. 82 min: Isaac Mbenza comes on for his seventh Premier League appearance, replacing the impressive Alex Pritchard.80 min: André Schürrle is played in Cairney, but the German, who opens up his body to wrap his right foot around the ball, cannot get his effort on target. He had Jorgensen back-pedalling and Lossl worried. That was a big chance given how few and far between they have been for Fulham tonight.79 min: Billing does well, snuffing the ball out from Cyrus Christie who had hoped to propel himself down the right wing. Fulham have grown in momentum, largely because of pumping the ball that bit longer to Mitrovic, but this is probably their best spell of the evening. Huddersfield, meanwhile, are readying changes.77 min: Mitrovic does superbly to buy a free-kick out of Jorgensen. Rico wellies the ball downfield, and the striker shoves the defender aside and backs into his marker. He holds up play, before being fouled. Fulham look to play it quickly, but then Cairney’s stopped in his tracks. Seri’s free-kick drops wide of goal.75 min: Suddenly, Fulham are three-on-two but André Schürrle is flagged offside. He wanted the pass to be a little quicker. Aleksandar Mitrovic’s frustrations earn him a booking.74 min: Kongolo clips Mitrovic, earning Fulham a free-kick on halfway. Instead of lumping it forward, they patiently build, but Mitrovic is flagged yards offside by the time that André Schürrle lashes the ball beyond Lossl.71 min: Huddersfield break down the left, with Pritchard beating the offside trap before shimmying down the left. Depoitre is among those awaiting the cross, but the winger fails to really get his head up and makes a mess of it. Le Marchand duly clears. Moments before, Schindler made a smart block on Mitrovic.70 min: To make things worse, Cairney doesn’t seem to be moving too freely. He just appeared to signal to the Fulham bench that he needed to come off.67 min: The corner drops in the box and Pritchard unleashes a stinging first-time effort from the edge of the area! It jets just over Sergio Rico’s goal. Huddersfield could do with a bit of breathing space and very nearly made some.66 min: Philip Billing does brilliantly again, nicking the ball in midfield. He’s totally bossed things in the middle of the park. Huddersfield stream forward down the right, again through Florent Hadergjonaj and win another corner.64 min: Kevin McDonald, the Fulham substitute, is in trouble and is replaced by Stefan Johansen. Things go from bad to worse, as Jokanovic is forced into making his third and final change of the evening. They haven’t got a lot else on the bench anyway, really. Except a sea of defenders.63 min: Rico slices a routine clearance up into the gods, before Sessegnon fails to get the ball under control, instead it cannons off his shin and out of play. That sums it up.62 min: The Premier League confirm the news that Christopher Schindler had feared: “Following review, the Huddersfield goal has been adjudged to be a Timothy Fosu-Mensah own goal,” the league says.59 min: Kevin McDonald plays a clever ball over the top of the Huddersfield defence, but Mitrovic is eventually flagged offside. André Schürrle, who was in close proximity, would have been onside. Never mind. Fulham could do with a bit more of that, to give Huddersfield something to think about at least.57 min: Le Marchand lashes the ball out of play, allowing Huddersfield to pen Fulham back in and gain some territory in the process.56 min: Laurent Depoitre’s name is being sung loud and proud around the John Smith’s Stadium the stuff of dreams.55 min: Florent Hadergjonaj flies down the right-hand side, but Sessegnon does well to just usher the defender away from goal. Meanwhile, Wagner does make his first change, but it’s Laurent Depoitre, on in place of Mounié.54 min: Fulham win a couple of corners in quick succession. Mitrovic’s first effort is deflected wide before steering his second wide of goal altogether.52 min: Billing is back up and moving. Good news.50 min: Philip Billing is in pain on halfway after a clash with Jean Michaël Seri. David Wagner looks as though he’s going to be forced into a change.49 min: ... Mounié wins the header from the long throw, flicking on for Mooy and Jorgensen, but Fulham just about clear their lines. That was so simple.48 min: Florent Hadergjonaj does well to help out Steve Mounié down the right flank, winning a throw-in which will be launched in by Philip Billing.47 min: Cyrus Christie bombs down the right and wins an early corner. Mitrovic is lurking on the edge of the box but Huddersfield’s Jorgensen get in to make the block. Fulham have shown more intensity in 90-odd seconds than that dire first 45 minutes.46 min: Fulham get us back under way. What kind of reaction might we see? Jokanovic had to change something. They surely can’t play much worse.A double change for Fulham at the break, with Cyrus Christie and Kevin McDonald summoned. Luciano Vietto and Fosu-Mensah have been hooked.Fulham have been a shadow of their old self, second-best and sloppy. Ryan Sessegnon’s brother, for one, is not overly impressed with Fulham’s first-half display, nor Slavisa Jokanovic’s selection. Chris Sessegnon tweets “You’re playing last years top goal scorer LEFT BACK. OMDSSSS”, six minutes after saying “I’m acc not watching this anymore”, and that 12 minutes after: “This is so bad.”Christopher Schindler’s second goal of the season is the difference at the interval, with the Huddersfield captain’s header ending the 658-minute goal drought on home soil. Fulham have been painfully poor, with Huddersfield running rings round their backline. Denis Odoi and Maxime Le Marchand have looked unconvincing at best, while Sessegnon and Fosu-Mensah have been repeatedly caught out at full-back. And Sessegnon can count himself fortunate not to have been pulled up for a foul on Florent Hadergjonaj inside the box just before the half-time whistle.45+1 min: Rico claws the ball back into play to make a save from a Huddersfield corner before Fulham go up the other end and win one themselves.45 min: There will be two added minutes.44 min: No penalty! Florent Hadergjonaj is felled in the box by Ryan Sessegnon. There is definitely a sneaky trip by the teenager on the Huddersfield full-back as he surges towards the byline, but Anthony Taylor’s not having any of it. The home appeals are in vain.43 min: Cairney pings the ball all the way back to Rico in the Fulham goal from almost halfway. That sums things up for them, really. They’ve looked second-best, bereft of confidence and totally out of ideas.41 min: Huddersfield are working Fulham so hard, and Slavisa Jokanovic’s side just don’t know where to turn next. Jorgensen does really well to pen in the Fulham defence, before Le Marchand eventually hacks the ball clear.38 min: Vietto dinks the ball just wide of goal ... but the linesman’s flag had been up for a while. It was good play by Sessegnon, driving down the left.37 min: Thirty-seven minutes played and Fulham have been desperately poor. They’ve made Huddersfield look like world beaters in patches."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c832b58192cd4bb231ae7cede403f60958d2af04/107_549_7161_4296/master/7161.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d2e0a0cbe8575b4237e2eeeb20182e7","title":"meet the disruptors shaking up the legal world","story":"From crowdfunding litigation to documenting court cases online, here’s how three startups are using technology to transform the sectorFounder and CEO, CrowdJusticeIn 2015, lawyer Julia Salasky gave up the security of her “job for life” to launch CrowdJustice, a platform that provides people with a means of raising funds for their legal matters. It’s based on a crowdfunding model, similar to the way Kickstarter and Indiegogo help founders raise funds for growing businesses, and enables its users to find a community of support as they move through the legal system.Salasky had always felt that the traditional legal career path wasn’t necessarily for her in the long term. She began her career as a commercial litigator at Linklaters, where she did a lot of pro bono work, including a six-month secondment to a legal aid centre.“There, I saw first hand how difficult it was for ordinary people to access legal services,” she says. “Then I left to be a lawyer at the UN, where I led a project that was intended to give people better access to justice online.”Although she felt the project didn’t have enough of an impact on the ground, it did plant a seed: the idea that behind its opaque, expensive facade, the legal system houses a fascinating trove of stories, and that iniduals might just get behind those stories to try to create change for people or social issues they care about. From there the idea for CrowdJustice took shape.You can raise funds for any cause, from those with a national profile, like victims of black-cab rapist John Worboys, to those affecting iniduals, including that of a 12-year-old trying to ensure that deaf children can take a GCSE in their first language – British Sign Language.But CrowdJustice is about more than just raising money. It’s about democratising the system, says Salasky. “That might mean getting access to a lawyer, but it also means knowing that other people are using the law, knowing that rights exist in the first place, and raising awareness around the legal issues that can, for better or for worse, cause seismic shifts in society.”Following its US launch last year, CrowdJustice has had some high-profile cases, including that of adult film actor Stormy Daniels, who has raised nearly $600,000 (£450,000) to challenge US president Donald Trump. Her lawyer has also recently taken on and is crowdfunding a new case to challenge the policy of removing immigrants’ children from them at the border.“Five years from now we’d love to be a trusted resource and legal destination for consumers – a place where you can not only pay for your case, but where you can also learn about the law and get more transparency over the process,” she says. “We think we’re just scratching the tip of the iceberg in pursuing our mission to make the law more accessible for everyone.”Co-founder and CEO, LexooTiming is everything when starting a new business, and when Daniel van Binsbergen founded Lexoo, a digital marketplace for legal services, he definitely spotted the right trends at the right time.It was 2014 when the former lawyer, then a senior associate at a large firm, working mainly in finance and mergers and acquisitions, had his lightbulb moment. Van Binsbergen saw an opportunity to create a digital marketplace that collated specialist practitioners in one place, to eliminate the stress typically associated with hiring a lawyer.The model is simple. A client submits their job, and then lawyers can express their interest in the work, with Lexoo selecting three or four of the most suitable lawyers to quote. Finally, the client picks the one they like the look of.“I was struck by the inefficiencies of the legal market and realised that the hourly rate model was partly to blame,” he says. “By having their lawyers bill by the hour, partners at the largest firms can earn huge sums, so there’s no incentive to make things more efficient.”The platform takes advantage of a shift in mindset in the legal profession, with growing numbers of senior lawyers rejecting the traditional goal of making the position of partner and instead opting to pursue meaningful careers by working independently.“Working from home or for small boutique practices, typically they were able to charge half their former rates but still make a very decent living,” says van Binsbergen. “More importantly, they could work flexibly and take back control of their lives. If that trend continued, it was clear we’d have lots of highly qualified specialist lawyers who were hard to find, because they were no longer tied to the big firms.”Initially focusing on connecting small businesses with lawyers in the UK, Lexoo’s client base now includes large multinationals. Without the overheads of the bigger firms, Lexoo’s more cost-effective services have helped it gain traction with major companies like Travelodge, which has appointed Lexoo to its law firm panel.Co-founder and CEO, CourtsdeskTo do his job, journalist Enda Leahy relied on authentic sources of information available in the public domain. One area he always had difficulty accessing, however, was the courts, and as a legal and securities correspondent, that presented a huge problem.He set out to solve it by digital means, giving up his job at the Irish Mail on Sunday to launch Courtsdesk, the Ireland-based legal reporting and data startup behind the first publicly accessible database of court cases in the UK and Ireland.“The legal aphorism ‘justice must be seen to be done’ is widely bandied around, and while one can walk into a courtroom, very little information is made available from there. With Courtsdesk, we set about changing that in a number of ways,” he says.Leahy and his co-founder, Alan Larkin, a software engineer, began work on Courtsdesk in October 2015. The plan was to develop a digital platform that would not only improve access to legal information, but also integrate and process it in a way that would create efficiencies of time and knowledge.Since its launch in 2017, the response from the legal and business worlds has been positive. Current users include organisations from the financial sector, and almost every national news organisation in Ireland. Two of Ireland’s top five law firms have already signed up, and many other large firms are trialling the service. In a sector not known for readily embracing change, some practices are being changed radically.“Lawyers need the knowledge to make a legal argument and train long and hard for that,” says Leahy. “However, they also spend a lot of time on manual processes that can be automated, and that’s where most of the opportunities have arisen. In some instances, doing an update for a client on hundreds of cases can literally take 1,000 hours. We can do that now with the click of a button.”In less than a year Courtsdesk’s capabilities have already evolved.Leahy says: “We can now do detailed sectoral analysis, for example, of every single case involving the top 20 law firms in the country, as well as things like timeline analysis, and relationship analysis, looking at which protagonists are linked to which entity or which company. What started off as a Google-type search of the courts has evolved into something closer to truly big-data analytics.”Courtsdesk is now preparing to launch in the UK, while its founders also have their sights set on markets in Europe and North America. Over time, Courtsdesk will be made available to academia and the general public.“Do I miss journalism? A little bit,” says Leahy. “There’s nothing like having a great public interest story that you feel passionately about, but we view what we are doing as a different type of journalism. In fact, we had a joke at the beginning that nobody should come and work for Courtsdesk unless they’ve watched All the President’s Men.”Photography: Camilla Greenwell and Shane Lynam for the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/506297209a4162d709e333963dd883d9450f288d/0_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bc145bf48cb343c7701a05dfe419e71","title":"exploring case law where the rulebook meets reality","story":"Case law is needed to clear up the ambiguities of the law. Here, three experts from Thomson Reuters reveal their favourite cases and explain their impact on the way we live todayWhen written in plain black and white, laws may seem like simple things: you can do this, you can’t do that. But when the theory comes into contact with the real world – a messy place filled with complicated human behaviours and interactions – that clarity can deteriorate fast.To correct for such ambiguities, we have case law. In case law, disputed legislation can be clarified by a senior court, setting a precedent by which other cases can be decided.Such clarifications are made in all manner of scenarios – from clearing up tax legislation to defining what’s lawful or unlawful in the bedroom. Here, we ask three legal minds to name their favourite cases from the archives.Jessica Brown, director of client training at Thomson ReutersBefore this case, judges could only use the text of the statute – words on a page – without any additional knowledge. Written in very generic terms, this text can be vague and ambiguous and therefore very difficult to apply.The Pepper v Hart case entailed looking at tax legislation to decide whether a teacher at a private school had to pay tax on the perk he received in the form of reduced school fees. What was important in this case was that the particular point about whether something was a tax benefit or not had been debated – it wasn’t specifically covered in the Finance Act 1976. Those on the case wanted to enter this parliamentary debate as evidence.The judges ruled that when primary legislation is ambiguous, then, under certain circumstances, the court may refer to statements made in the House of Commons or House of Lords. In other words, look at the debates or presentations made in parliament when the act was being created, to get a better understanding of the reasoning and justification to interpret the meaning of the legislation.For the first time, judges had more than just the words on the page. It saved a lot of court time, because any ambiguities could just be resolved by looking at what had been discussed in parliament.Take Anti-Slavery Day, for example, which was created by an Act of Parliament to raise awareness of modern slavery and to inspire people to eliminate it. It was a fantastic idea, however, the act was incredibly badly drafted. All it said was “we shall specify a day that shall be observed each year as Anti-Slavery Day”, with no definition of what should be done. Did it mean a day off, a minute’s silence, specific activities to mark the day? It was almost impossible to comply with. It’s only when you look at the debate that you can see there was a discussion over when it should take place and how to mark the day.With Brexit on the horizon, there is likely to be a raft of new legislation that will be passed in a bit of a hurry, and that’s where ambiguities and vagueness can slip in. Being able to look at additional materials and understand what the law is actually getting at will save time and create that certainty in the law that wasn’t really available up until this case.Kerrie Lloyd-Dawson, specialist editor and court reporter, Westlaw UK (above)The case involved five men who had willingly engaged in sadomasochistic acts, resulting in the infliction of actual (ABH) and grievous bodily harm (GBH). Although none of the men had reported anything to the police, the Crown Prosecution Service acted on a video of the encounter and charged them under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. The issue was whether they could consent to the harm, and the House of Lords decided that their consent was not a defence, and that the consensual infliction of harm on another for sexual gratification was not an act the law should permit.Some commentators of the time expressed the view that had the facts been different, and involved heterosexual sadomasochistic activity, it would have been found lawful. Others insist that if it were made today, the decision would be different.Where do you draw the line? With Brown, the judges decided that it wasn’t in the public interest that a person should cause ABH to another person for no good reason. However, there are established exceptions, the sport of boxing for example, or tattooing and body piercing, which cause ABH but are not considered a crime.What you can consent to and at what point the law should intervene is a fascinating and complex subject that will continue to spark debate and ide opinions for many years to come.However, currently, I am particularly interested in the cases concerning the employment status of people working in a myriad of creative business structures, the so-called “gig-economy” companies. These are structures that enable businesses to be flexible, classing people as self-employed rather than employees, so they are not entitled to the statutory rights afforded to employees and workers (for example the national minimum wage).All of these cases have their roots in a case from 2011 (Autoclenz Ltd v Belcher), involving 20 valets who worked for the car cleaning company Autoclenz. Their contracts described them as self-employed, on the basis that they were under no obligation to accept work and they had a right of substitution (they could send someone else to do the job). However, these contracts didn’t reflect reality. The valets were required to turn up for work every day and to notify Autoclenz in advance if they were unable to work.The group took Autoclenz to the employment tribunal, claiming that they were employees and the case eventually went to the supreme court, which upheld the tribunal decision. Importantly, it held that when determining an inidual’s employment status the relative bargaining power of the parties must be taken into account in deciding whether the terms of any written agreement represented what was agreed. The reality was that an inidual applying for a role to valet cars did not have the power to negotiate the terms of the contract.The decision means that employment tribunals may disregard the terms of a written agreement that do not reflect the actual agreement between the parties. The focus of the tribunal’s enquiry should be on the “actual legal obligations of the parties”. This has far-reaching implications, not just for employment status cases currently before the courts and tribunals, but in ways that we don’t yet appreciate – who knows how people will be working in another five or 10 years from now?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9db9e9e6d73882029a9d454e0b9da7ad452a0794/0_2_1960_1176/master/1960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6ebcde3149a1cd01d6a4c5bb8a41950","title":"can blockchain shake up the legal sector for the better","story":"Blockchain – one of the buzzwords of the year – could help the legal system run more smoothly and efficiently. But data privacy and regulations may limit its impact In 2008, Apple’s creation of the app store led to the introduction of apps for everything. More than a decade later, it now seems there’s a blockchain for everything. The technology that’s best known for underpinning the Bitcoin cryptocurrency has spawned a new raft of ambitious startups looking to make the most of it.The blockchain has a simple underlying premise: to allow people to share digital assets with another internet user. The transfer is carried out securely and can be seen by all users of the network it is shared upon, using a public record of all transactions. Blockchain networks can be open to anyone or act as a private system that’s only accessible to those granted permission.Despite analysts at Forrester predicting that 2018 will be the start of the downfall for blockchain proposals that have been too optimistic, the technology’s combination of transparency and security has led to blockchain being developed for almost every industry – having branched out from its cryptocurrency origin. Many blockchain efforts are in their early stages, with developers still attempting to get wide rollout, but blockchain applications are being developed to track food safety information, distribute movies and store electronic medical records.But how could blockchain be applied to the legal profession and regulatory environment? “Blockchain technology can affect the legal practice in two significant ways,” says Primavera De Filippi, a researcher at the National Center of Scientific Research in Paris and faculty associate at Harvard University. First: it has the potential to act as a secure database where documents, such as evidence, can be stored and then referenced later on if arguments arise.The second potential application, De Filippi says, is in creating a way for contracts to be created and transferred digitally, reducing the need for legal instruments. Smart contracts can remove the need for a middle-party in deals and reduce overall costs. “Blockchain definitely has the power to create more efficiency, with secure and transparent transactions,” adds Richard Anderson, product management director, legal risk, at Thomson Reuters Legal.One industry in which this is already happening is shipping. IBM and Maersk have started to use smart contracts at more than 20 ports around the world to track the movement of containers and share shipping documents. The firms say more than 154m shipping events – including arrival times, customs forms, and invoices – have been recorded in the system and it has reduced costs to the industry.Anderson adds that the transparency around the document sender and creator within blockchain applications may also help banks prevent fraud. In particular, it could help easily identify people involved in financial transactions and prevent money laundering. Financial groups have to understand – through regulations referred to as “know your customer” – who owns accounts and is making transactions. Anderson says the blockchain can be used to verify the identity of those completing transactions. When it is used, it has the potential to disrupt the entire industry. “There is a significant chance that blockchain being heavily used by financial services reduces the ‘know your customer’ burden to the degree that certain regulatory solutions are cannibalised and no longer needed,” he adds.However, most of these technologies aren’t in place yet. “People have seen this massive explosion of cryptocurrency and assume there must be a significant use of blockchain,” Anderson says. He likens the hype around blockchain to the recent surge in artificial intelligence. But AI has reached the stage where businesses now understand how they may be able to take advantage of it, Anderson says. “I don’t think that maturity has happened with blockchain.”Primarily, for blockchain, there is one significant hurdle to overcome before it can be widely deployed. “The legal profession should ensure that uses of blockchain technology actually comply with the law and do not tamper with fundamental rights, like the right to privacy,” De Filippi says. Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which started to be enforced in May 2018, strengthens the rights of iniduals and increases the safeguards on their personal data. It may also have a stalling impact on the adoption of blockchain tech.Around the world, regulators are currently creating plans covering how blockchain and cryptocurrencies should be regulated. The UK parliament has created a cross-party working group to look at the impact of the blockchain, regulators in Canada are drafting regulations due to be published in 2019, and analysis from PwC has suggested the biggest barrier to blockchain adoption for businesses is the amount of regulatory uncertainty around the tech.In the short term, blockchain has a difficult future. “When you look at a hardening regulatory environment around data privacy – whether you think that’s right or wrong, it is definitely happening with GDPR – it’s clear that blockchain is going to come up against regulation,” Anderson says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19421bbcaa1f44d830dc17fa02247c4fa3077c4d/0_103_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0409d00db0523b78534c26b646934f8a","title":"a 13 year old girl is a lesbian if she plays football some things dont change","story":"Taunts like this have been around for decades – but this playground name-calling reflects how women’s sports are treatedWhen I was in school a few decades ago, it was standard to be called a lesbian if you so much as kicked a football back to a boy in the playground. This was obviously after the ball had been aimed at one’s (lesbo) head in the kind of terrifying gesture that we were taught, as girls, to laugh off – or, worse, take as a compliment. (See also: the pinging of bra straps.) Well, here we are in 2018, which in many ways is just an endless gif of a football whacking your outraged teenage head (which – ha! – in my case turned out to be bisexual), and a 13-year-old girl is being called a lesbian … for playing football. Some things, such as the nature and content of homophobic taunts, don’t change.Darcie, from Monmouthshire in Wales, has reportedly been told by PE teachers that she cannot play football as a recommended sport at school. Her peers “have criticised me a lot by saying I’m a man or a lesbian”, she says. The other children’s parents are reportedly no better, apparently shouting “don’t let a girl tackle you” during matches. Gender stereotyping never looked so unoriginal.Anyone who is bringing up children or has walked past a playground or weekend kickabout in their local park will have clocked the vast outnumbering of boys playing football while a vast outnumbering of dads shout encouragement the separating of primary school girls and boys for sports days the conspicuous lack of girls and, for that matter, black and Asian children.The veneration of conventionality has always been the way of school life, stultifying for so many of us, but gender stereotyping and segregation in sport continues to be completely unacknowledged. Which is how you get dated, embarrassing stuff happening, like England’s national governing body for swimming offering guidance to women on the best costume for flabby stomachs, pear shapes, boyish bodies and large or small busts. In 2018. In schools and sports clubs across the country, it’s as if #thisgirlcan never happened."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5be7dc88f69e2a1a31790c9464ebf1425a502052/0_224_4831_2899/master/4831.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02e86ebe3dc9a75627dae5e7672573b4","title":"chunks of my tongue came off you could see the tastebuds ross edgley on swimming around great britain","story":"The fitness expert survived raw wounds and jellyfish stings, braved storms and emptied a 5kg bucket of petroleum jelly to complete the record-breaking feat of mental and physical endurance. So, is he a masochist?Ross Edgley, who has just become the first man to swim around Great Britain, is trying to describe what it feels like to have your tongue disintegrate. “I realised something was bad when I woke up with chunks of it on my pillow,” he recalls. The flesh was translucent, but otherwise a lot like beef stroganoff or slow-cooked pork. “It’s that tender, you’re just pulling strips off,” says Edgley energetically. “You could see the tastebuds on it, it was that thick.”Endurance swimmers call it salt mouth – the effect of seawater buildup in your mouth and throat. Edgley’s was at its worst as he passed Dungeness in early June, about 85 hours of swimming after setting out from Margate harbour. “Even a week in, it went from being a swim as most people consider it, as a sport, to being a survival exercise,” he says.That “exercise” lasted 157 days, during each of which Edgley slept no more than six hours, and often less, and swam for six hours, and sometimes more.Alongside him was his support crew, husband and wife Matt and Suzanne Knight, on board their 16m (52ft) catamaran Hecate. The instant Edgley boarded the boat every day, its location was recorded, and it would return to that exact point when the time came for Edgley to return to the water, thereby ensuring a continuous circumnavigation of 1,792 miles – about the same distance as London to Moscow by road.In the course of his five-month-long Great British Swim, Edgley raced ferries, stopped boats, braved storms, swam with countless dolphins, suffered hundreds of jellyfish stings, saw “every single seal”, and became a connoisseur of the nation’s waters. “Scotland tasted really nice,” he tells me. The Irish Sea, he says after consideration, was “organic”. The Humber Estuary: “straight-up fertiliser”.Looking back, he had an overabundance of naivety, Edgley cheerily admits now, on the penultimate day of his journey. It is Saturday morning and we are drinking coffee in the cockpit of Hecate, moored off Margate pier ahead of his final leg. He shows me a 5kg bucket of petroleum jelly, nearly hollowed out. “At the start, I was like, there’s no way we’re going to get through that. We’ve done almost a kilo a month.”Edgley himself is barely recognisable from the sleek bodybuilder of his first vlog. Then he had resembled a superhero who shared DNA with one of those giant river otters, or a pedigree bull terrier. The bearded man sitting opposite me, wearing a bobble hat and a fleece-lined hooded cloak, is more reminiscent of Bilbo Baggins towards the end of his unexpected journey.In five months, Edgley has put on 8kg to weigh 100kg, gaining muscle in his shoulders, losing it in his legs, and developing a “seal-like bulk” all over. “My body’s completely changed. I’ve got hairier, I’ve got fatter.” Fitness is a slippery concept, although he tried to pin it down in his “eccentric and comprehensive” bestseller, The World’s Fittest Book. “There is no definition. Right now, I’m really fit if you want me to swim around Great Britain, but awful if you want me to run a marathon.”After swimming 12 hours a day for five months, he has adapted “to the point where I’m really going to be bad on land”. He has been doing balance and leg-strengthening exercises in readiness. His feet have entirely lost their arches, he tells me, though their purply-yellow colour is apparently no cause for concern. His trench foot (“pretty bad, at one point. Yeah, you can lose them”) has cleared up, as has a “sea ulcer” on his heel. “It’s not as bad as it sounds!” he says, seeing my expression. “If you got a tiny cut, it would never heal, it would just get deeper and deeper. It would start going through to the bone, essentially.”Edgley’s achievement, it quickly becomes apparent, is compelling not just as an unprecedented feat of mental and physical endurance, but in a similar way to those lurid quasi-documentaries about medical anomalies. At the same time as his tongue was disintegrating, chafing from his wetsuit created a raw wound, inspiring the viewers of his weekly vlogs to give him the nickname Rhino Neck. Efforts to protect it with layers of Sudocrem, plasters, Vaseline, bin bags and duct tape were time-consuming and only partially successful.“Imagine having an open wound and rubbing it with sandpaper for 12 hours a day – that’s what it was like,” says Edgley. “I woke up the next morning and my bedsheets were stuck to it. I was like, ‘Oh, for God’s sake’, ripped it off, then got in and swam.” His girlfriend, Hester Sabery, was fortunate enough to be visiting him onboard Hecate at the time. “Oh yeah, that was horrific,” she says later, wincing at the memory. “He just had blisters all over his shoulders, his neck, his chest. And when he moved, they were all just there on the pillow.”But he never thought of giving up, he says. He took to heart the advice of Alexei Janssen, a performance coach to the royal marines, to focus on the process – then the outcome would become inevitable. “Never did I think about arriving at Margate, or quitting. I stopped counting up or down.” There was no time to feel sorry for himself, anyway, with his precious few hours out of the water needing to be spent sleeping or eating. With a daily target of 15,000 calories, Edgley has described his endeavour as a “giant eating competition, with a bit of swimming in between”.“ROSS EDGLEY’S BANANA TALLY”, crudely scrawled on the cockpit roof in permanent marker, stands at 649. While in the water he ate one every 20 minutes, with the occasional break for fortified porridge or noodles. Between swims he ate breakfast – a proper fry-up, with four slices of toast, two or three eggs, baked beans, the lot – lunch and dinner: a full day’s meals every 12 hours. “It was like double time,” says Suzanne Knight, who took charge of Edgley’s nutrition. “The thing is, when he started the swim, he carried no fat at all, he was all muscle. That’s why we went crazy and bulked him up so much.”For Edgley, who co-founded a fitness supplements company, food needed to be dense not only in calories but also in nutrients digestible in the mix of what else he had eaten that day and palatable, given his current state of physical degradation. (“Can you imagine your salt tongue hanging off, then trying to eat granola?”) He took an intuitive approach to his diet, which allowed for emerging from the ocean to wolf down two Dominos pizzas, back to back.But the challenge was as much mental as physical. “When you add it all up, I’ve probably spent a month on my own, staring at the bottom of the seabed,” he says. “There were times when I wasn’t thinking about surviving, when I could coast – that’s when you can go into this moving meditation and mull over everything. But people ask if I’ve come to any amazing epiphanies, whereas I get out and go: ‘Have we got any cheese left? Can I get a cheese toastie?’”In his cabin he was reading Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations on stoic philosophy (“It’s been brilliant, this psychology in the face of adversity”), which he says dovetailed with sports science. Edgley knew that revving himself up, or swimming angry, could stress his immune system and jeopardise his endurance for the rest of the journey. His MO, as he explained in a vlog, was to “swim with a smile”, even through clouds of jellyfish. (Part of the reason he grew a beard was to serve as protection.) “That was easier said than done, and sometimes I was putting on a brave face – for the crew as well.”His lowest moment, he says – worse than the salt tongue or his “neck hanging off” – was when he was kept awake for six hours by a sting to the face while crossing the Irish Sea. He mimes feverish scratching of his arms: “I looked possessed. I was walking around naked on deck because the wind was the only thing that soothed my skin.” It sounds like King Lear on the moor, I say, by now in my own heavy-weather robe. “Yeah, it was! Eventually, I went to bed and from my cabin, saw day turn to night and night turn to day. The tide changed, and Matt knew I hadn’t slept. He said: ‘Mate, I’m so sorry – you have to go in.’ It had literally just stopped itching.”It seems paradoxical that someone so dedicated to fine-tuning the body “as an instrument, not an ornament” – a phrase by which he repeatedly condemns the aesthetics-led approach of the wider fitness industry – would cause himself so much physical damage. “I think sports science – and medical science – quite rightly errs on the side of caution and would be like: ‘You need rest, you need to take antibiotics, or something,’” Edgley agrees. But he sees his own body as not just an instrument but an experiment – a willing subject on which to test his theories of athletic performance “in the lab that is the Great British coastline”.He was inspired by the Hungarian-Canadian endocrinologist Hans Selye’s work on general adaptation in 1936. By gradually increasing lab rats’ tolerance to poison, Selye was able to prove that stress and stimuli were the key to adaptation, says Edgley. “What I’m saying is, yes, I absolutely am worried about long-term damage. But what if I am becoming one of Hans Selye’s indestructible rats? You don’t know.“In the fitness community, we’re all told ‘Lose a stone in the week’, ‘Get fit in five easy steps’ – no one wants to say, ‘Get fit through stress and stimuli according to Hans Selye’s work in 1936.’ That’s not going to sell anything. No one wants to say: ‘If you want to get fit or lose weight, it’s going to be hard – you’re going to suffer.’”Is he a masochist? “That’s a good question.” Five months ago, he would have said no now, he is not so sure. “In this small bubble, with Matt and I both so driven towards the same goal, I’m like: ‘Why wouldn’t you swim with your tongue hanging off?’ I would say I’m not a masochist, but maybe a month from now, when I’m looking back objectively, from outside the bubble, I’ll go: ‘What was I doing?’”So what will he be doing a month from now? “Well, genuinely learning to walk again” – and then a marathon by Christmas. “I think that might be quite a good litmus test.”Red Bull Media House documented the Great British Swim in weekly vlogs via the Red Bull YouTube channel.

It is your sanctuary: keep it tranquil and dark. Your body needs darkness to release melatonin, which in turn helps you sleep – so invest in blackout blinds or an eye mask. Switch off mobile phones and computer screens, as their LED screen blue light is particularly unhelpful for melatonin production. If you need a new mattress, spend time choosing one that is appropriate, and make sure your duvet is the right tog for the season.*Sex is also good. An orgasm last thing can help you nod off.The buzz phrase is sleep hygiene, meaning don’t do anything during the day that might inhibit your sleep later on, and slow down at bedtime. So avoid naps, and go to bed and get up at roughly the same time each day. Enjoy your night-time routine: have a hot bath (it raises your body temperature, which helps you nod off), switch off your devices at least 40 minutes before you turn in, read a book, play soothing music or listen to a “nodcast”.Alcohol can interfere with your sleep cycle – it helps you sleep initially, but wakes you up a few hours later. Avoid big meals in the evening, especially rich, heavy or spicy foods that can cause heartburn and stomach trouble. Don’t drink coffee after lunchtime – 2017 research found caffeine reduces your sleep time and quality.Part of what keeps us awake at night is stress about being awake. So resist the temptation to clock-watch, which can make you anxious: instead, luxuriate in feeling comfortable, safe and warm. Revisit happy memories and tell yourself that you will still function fine tomorrow.If you often lie awake for more than half an hour, either when you first go to bed or if you wake in the night, get up and make yourself comfortable somewhere else with a book or some music. Return to bed when you feel tired – this will help you associate bed with sleep and not with wakefulness.Record your sleep habits over a fortnight: when you go to bed, how long it takes you to sleep, whether you wake in the night. Look for patterns you can change – maybe you sleep best when you’ve exercised. A sleep diary can also help a doctor pinpoint what’s wrong. If all else fails, get checked out: insomnia is linked with depression, and for some people sleep disruption is an early sign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03e5039f82b0f8b0333a7ad0fe9c86a4e002d77e/430_653_4841_2904/master/4841.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b1e3c343d70ee5e906718f13277e14c","title":"should i dress more smartly for work","story":"We live in an image-obsessed world, says Sharmadean Reid.

I tend to start the week in what I call “cosy clothes”, a tracksuit or a jumper. I probably look a “hot mess”, too, but it means I can be focused.

When I like my look, I feel more confident about my meetings.Advertising, I can imagine, is very image-based and of course you feel a certain pressure to look good.

But there are plenty of ways to stay one step ahead of the darknessApril is allegedly the cruellest month, but October and November could give it a run for its money. In the northern hemisphere, the nights are noticably drawing in, especially now the clocks have gone back and sunset is an hour earlier. Every day, it gets darker two minutes earlier than it did the day before. And, while there are compensations – hello moon! Hello stars! Hello, most of all, Orion the Hunter, back in our northern skies after long months below the horizon – many of us cannot be consoled. As one of his patients told the US psychiatrist Norman Rosenthal: “I didn’t realise how quickly we haemorrhage light”.“I love that expression ‘the haemorrhaging of light,’” Rosenthal says. “With a haemorrhage, you feel depleted, you feel exhausted. It dramatises something that’s real.” According to Rosenthal, who has spent more than 30 years studying the effects of seasonal changes on mood, about one in five Americans suffer some sort of “winter blues”. He is one of them. When we speak, it is 8.30am in his hometown of Bethesda, Maryland, and he is sitting in front of a light designed to reduce the symptoms.Things are even worse in the UK, especially after the kind of long, hot summer that we have just enjoyed. “Cloud cover is very important,” Rosenthal explains. “Historically, Britain is a cloudy nation. It’s an island nation, there’s a lot of fog and cloud coming off the sea. More recently, your summers have been more like ours – hot and sunny and dry. Now, when you have a hot, sunny and dry summer and a cloudy, dark winter, that’s when the seasonality of the problem becomes more apparent.” The further north you go, the gloomier it gets. In the winter, there are parts of northern Scotland that get an average of just 64 minutes of sunlight a day, according to the Met Office.Perhaps a quarter of those with winter blues develop the extreme form known as seasonal affective disorder, or Sad. “This is characterised by the typical features of depression – poor sleep, low mood, irritability, social withdrawal and perhaps overeating, too,” says Sally Norton, a consultant surgeon and weight-loss expert with an interest in Sad. “It is probably, in part, related to hormonal changes around those chemical messengers such as serotonin and melatonin involved in regulating our body clock.” Mark Winwood, a director of psychological services for Axa PPP healthcare, adds that people with Sad “may find it very difficult to wake up in the morning and can often feel sleepy during the day. You may crave chocolate and high-carbohydrate foods, such as white bread or sugary foods. And you probably won’t be doing as much physically, so it’s easy to put on weight.”Sad and the winter blues are sometimes described as separate conditions, but Rosenthal prefers to talk of a “spectrum”. “Some people are really laid low by it and some people are just hampered by it. Let’s say your wife has Sad and you’ve got a little bit of winter blues. You get up in the morning and you don’t feel as good as you do in the summer, but you get yourself together and by the middle of the morning you’re not feeling so bad. But your wife can’t get out of bed at all. And you say: ‘I don’t know what’s the matter with you, dear. I get up, I go to work …’ It’s important to realise that a person isn’t fixed in a category. They can move to and fro depending on what they do and how bad the winter is.”So, what can you do about it? “‘Take it seriously’ is always my first piece of advice,” says Rosenthal. “You Brits are famous for your stiff upper lip and just getting on with the job, but that is the philosophy of minimising and denial. If there was nothing you can do about it, fine – but there is.”The worst cases may call for antidepressants or cognitive behavioural therapy. Otherwise, you could try spending a few hours every day in front of a lightbox, like the one Rosenthal uses. He recommends the specialist suppliers Lumie and the Sad Lightbox Company, and a box that will put out at least 10,000 lux. (By way of comparison, a sunny summer’s day might deliver 100,000 lux.) If you don’t spend much time at home, there are portable versions that are barely bigger than an iPad. “Morning treatments are best,” Rosenthal says. “The earlier the better.” He is also a fan of dawn simulators, which gradually light up your bedroom in the morning. Although winter’s late sunrises feel less oppressive than its early sunsets, that does not mean they don’t affect us.Most of the advice for dealing with Sad or the winter blues boils down to: “Get more light.” You can start by making at least one room in your home as bright as possible, by adding artificial light, opening curtains, rolling up blinds, cleaning your windows and trimming any plants that obscure them. Then, even if it is raining, snowing or blowing a gale, get outdoors as much as possible. As Winwood says: “Natural daylight supports our circadian clock and helps us sleep at night. So, even if you seem to go to work when it’s dark and also go home when it’s dark, get out in the lunch hour. Even better, use it as a time to do your daily exercise.” Exercise, after all, is known to improve your mood, whatever the time of year.Even – especially – if you don’t think of yourself as a winter person, it is worth investing in warm clothes so the weather can’t keep you cooped up. While you are out, the sunlight will encourage your body to produce vitamin D. Although Norton says there is only “limited evidence” for vitamin D improving mood, “there is no doubt that many of us are deficient in the winter months”.When the night falls, don’t fight it too hard. “Our tendency to turn on blazing lights as soon as the light drops is bound to confuse our body,” Norton says. “Try to keep lights dim in the evening and let your body clock tell you when it’s time to sleep. Getting to bed early enough to get a good eight hours will help your mood and so much more.” And stay away from screens for at least two hours before you go to bed. “They suppress the sleep hormone melatonin, making it more difficult to drift off and reducing sleep quality.”You should also watch what you eat, she warns. “While low mood and poor sleep has many people reaching for high-carb, sugary food, this is unlikely to help in the long term, with weight gain and yo-yoing blood sugar making sleep more difficult and worsening mood further.”The important thing, Rosenthal repeats, is to realise that you are not powerless. “I find people who say: ‘I can’t deal with it!’ And I think to myself: ‘Let’s just put everything in place for you to have the best possible winter.’“It’s not just about managing winter,” he says. “I think you need to enjoy it. Life should be embraced.”Norman Rosenthal’s Winter Blues is published by Guilford Press."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29154973f074960f0af69cc6dd7f29cd56de0967/0_50_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09e9e989b476cafc49db8d6d0e45625a","title":"guardian passes 1m mark in reader donations katharine viner","story":"Business model showing way for journalism to ‘regain its relevance’, says editor-in-chiefMore than a million people worldwide have contributed to the  in the last three years, with 500,000 paying to support the publication on an ongoing basis, according to  News and Media’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.She said the business model was showing a new way for journalism to “regain its relevance, meaning and trusted place in society”.Viner told the Society of Editors’ annual conference in Salford that many contributors donated specifically because they wanted the  to stay free and outside a paywall, so “progressive journalism can have the widest possible impact”.“Many readers didn’t understand the challenging commercial reality facing all news organisations, but once we told them more, they expressed real interest in wanting to support the ,” she said. “This was helped by the fact that any money made by the  has to be spent on journalism, because of our ownership structure with no shareholders or owner.“This entirely new revenue stream of monthly and one-off contributions is now a crucial part of our plan to get the  to break even by next April.

Now some companies are shortening the working week to increase efficiency, health and happinessI meet Rich Leigh for a coffee in Gloucester on a Friday, his day off. In fact, his entire company has the day off, because Radioactive PR, the firm led by Leigh, 30, has adopted a four-day week.It is one of a handful of UK businesses that now operate like this: staff still get paid their previous five-day salary, but they work a day less. The company began with a six-week trial and found that they achieved just as much – and there were even signs of growth. The key to the scheme’s success, Leigh says, is how happy his employees now are. “There are two ways to make money in my line of work,” he says, “retain clients and get new ones. Miserable, tired staff can’t do either.”The four-day working week is being touted by some as the answer to Britain’s “productivity problem”. British people work some of the longest hours in Europe: the average British worker takes only a 34-minute lunch break and works 10 hours overtime each week (more often than not, this is unpaid). Yet UK productivity lags seriously behind our European neighbours, who tend to work fewer hours. France recently made it illegal to expect workers to answer emails out of hours, and the average French worker produces more by the end of Thursday than their UK counterparts do in a full week.The EU working time directive sets a limit of 48 working hours a week. Britain is the only EU member that allows workers to opt out of this and work longer hours, a practice that trade unions have argued has been subject to “widespread abuse”.For campaigners, now is the time for a change. There is both opportunity and need, on health, happiness and business grounds. Those who have called for the introduction of a four-day week include the Green party and Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress. O’Grady argues that where businesses have increased their profits as a result of automation, that success should be shared with workers in the form of reduced hours: “It’s time to share the wealth from new technology, not allow those at the top to grab it for themselves,” she says.It is thought that a four-day working week would have a particularly big impact on women, given the caring responsibilities and unpaid domestic labour they often end up undertaking. At the very least, it would be one less day of childcare for families to pay for. “It’s made me feel less stressed about coming back after maternity leave,” says Planells. Could she ever go back to a five-day week? “Honestly, I don’t see myself ever leaving,” she says. “Did I mention how many CVs we’ve had in since people found out we went four days?”The four-day week doesn’t mean working 40 hours over four days, nor is it about shift patterns. Rather it is about working a 28- to 32-hour week but being paid for a 35- to 40-hour, traditional full-time job. In Edinburgh, workers at the tech firm Administrate are also four days a week, although the office is open five – some people work Monday to Thursday others Tuesday to Friday.Administrate introduced the four-day week in 2015. “It was an experiment,” says John Peebles, the CEO. “We wanted to see: if we invest in our people, will the financial outcome be better than if we pinched every penny?”Efficiency has made up for the loss of working hours. “In a lot of tech companies, time is lost to overly long meetings,” says Peebles, “or having beers in the last hour. But what if we just worked really hard for 32 hours a week and didn’t have any downtime?” Administrate has rules on keeping meetings short and encourages team bonding to take place in set spaces (regular team lunches, for example).Price is also concerned by the sentiment behind the movement, which he says is, in part, “the assumption that work isn’t good, so you should do less of it”. He points to the phrase “work-life balance”, which “implies that life is not work”, and argues that rather than concentrating on the quantity of work we do, we should focus on the quality.“We should be thinking about workplace happiness and engagement,” he says. “I know there is a lot of awfully dull and repetitive work that would be great for computers to take away. But then there’s other work that is stimulating, and the question is how we create those jobs into the future.”At the heart of this discussion are some very complex questions: what is work? Is there a difference between good work and bad work, and why is some work paid well and other work less so? Commutes in the UK are getting longer as housing prices in city centres rise, and it is becoming increasingly common for people to answer their emails while commuting. Should that count towards our overall tally of hours?Aidan Harper is the founder of the 4 Day Week campaign. He wants to ensure that a shorter working week is universally guaranteed for all workers, either by legislation or trade union bargaining.“In the UK, we have growing numbers of overworked people,” says Harper, “but we also have a growing number of underworked people, namely gig economy employees looking for more work. So one question is whether the redistribution of time, of workload, might help this.“And there is a more potent question about what the economy is for. Surely the purpose of the economy is to create a good life within it, and have a material basis from which you can be housed, have an education etc. But something our economy is not providing for us is time, which we need. The next stage in economic development should not be to generate more stuff, but to create the conditions in which we can live good lives.”Harper points to the role campaigners and everyday workers have in pushing for positive change. The five-day working week was itself the result of negotiations by unions in the early 20th century – observing technological advances in factories, they negotiated for a formal weekend rather than just a single Sunday off.For Peebles, the time is right to reassess. “Business is different today than 30 years ago, when I couldn’t send an email, couldn’t shop online, had to use a fax machine. So why are we working the same way?”In Gloucester, Leigh is keen to beat the commuter traffic and enjoy the rest of his day off. “Most businesses in the UK are like mine, fairly small,” he says, “one to 10 employees and working in the service industry. So all I’m saying is: why not try it?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dabbab9cc8f54072d964ea1446f1b29cecfc3475/0_240_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=374bac346ebc90461e5915a16bef41d4","title":"spice girls announce reunion tour without victoria beckham","story":"Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton, Geri Horner and Melanie Chisholm will tour the UK in 2019When five become four (again): the Spice Girls have announced a 2019 tour without founding member Victoria Beckham.Melanie Chisholm, Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton and Geri Horner (née Halliwell) will commence a six-date UK tour on 1 June 2019 at Manchester Etihad stadium with support from Jess Glynne.In a video announcing the reunion, they made no mention of their missing bandmate. A press release stated that Beckham – who has often displayed a self-awareness about her lack of natural musical talent – is concentrating on her fashion label, a career that has arguably given her the greatest post-pop success of any Spice Girls member.“Being in the Spice Girls was a hugely important part of my life and I wish my girls so much love and fun as they go back on tour,” Beckham said in a statement. “I know they will put on an amazing show and the fantastic fans past and present are going to have a wonderful time!”Brown recently attended a Halloween party dressed as Beckham, holding up a sign that read: “No I am not going on tour.” She was joined by boyfriend Gary Madatyan dressed as David Beckham, who held a sign that said: “Please, please, please do it for the Spice Girls fans.”It will be the second time the band has toured with a reduced membership. Horner quit the Spice Girls in May 1998 prior to the group’s first North American tour, which they completed without her. She rejoined the group in 2007 for their first reunion tour and a greatest hits collection that contained one new song, Headlines (Friendship Never Ends).The five-piece reunited for a one-off performance at the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games. Further reunion tours have been rumoured ever since: in February 2018, the five held a meeting and indicated that they intended to work on new projects together.In May, Brown said that all five original members had signed on to work with former manager Simon Fuller. They began working with Fuller in 1995 after firing the father-son management team of Chris and Bob Herbert that put the group together in 1994. The group fired Fuller – who co-ordinated their many lucrative commercial partnerships – in November 1997 and took control of their affairs.The band’s members have pursued a variety of projects since going on hiatus in 2000. Each of them has released solo music: Beckham had the shortest-lived musical career while Chisholm continues to release music under her own name. Brown has been a judge on the British version of the X Factor, among other TV talent shows. Bunton is a presenter on radio station Heart London and was recently announced as host of the US version of the Great British Bake Off. Horner has written children’s books and been a judge on Australia’s Got Talent.The news of their reunion has provoked a mixed response. “Last time they toured, it felt as if there was unfinished business to sort out, particularly as it was the full lineup,” said Popjustice editor Peter Robinson. “But after that massive tour and the release of new music a few years ago, I wonder what really remains unfinished in 2018.”Robinson suggested that the best way for the group to have sustained their legacy would have been an international TV talent search to find the new Spice Girls. “I’d assume, with Simon Fuller involved, that this will be part of the rollout in the coming months.”Broadcaster and author Miranda Sawyer suggested that the group’s ages (between 42 and 46) could be a motivation for the reunion. “They’ve hit middle age and that’s when you question the whole of your life,” said Sawyer, who wrote a book on middle age called Out of Time. “You look at your ‘legacy’ – and this happens to everyone, the Spice Girls or not – and think, what have I done with my life? And if the biggest thing you ever did was in your 20s, you may want to revisit that period.”That, said Sawyer, was the likely reason for Beckham’s non-participation. “The biggest and most important thing in her life is her family and her career – she has absolutely moved on and is having another life.”David Sinclair, author of the biography Wannabe: How the Spice Girls Reinvented Pop Fame, agreed that the group might want to relive former glories. “There must be a terrible feeling of loss that they were such a global phenomenon at a certain moment, but it didn’t last that long. They were in a little bubble for a few years and it really was just whipped away. There must be a very strong urge to go back and recover that.”Lauren Bravo, author of the new book What Would the Spice Girls Do: How the Girl Power Generation Grew Up, said she was not surprised by their comeback. “It takes 15 or 20 years for things to come back around again: the shops are full of revived 90s trends. Nineties kids had the feeling that all the important radical pop culture had happened before we were born – we were told that everything we had was a pallid rehash of the 60s and 70s – so it is nice to look back and think, that was important.”BBC Radio 1 presenter Clara Amfo often plays Spice Girls songs on her mid-morning weekday show and said they always receive a positive response. She welcomed the tour. “Do I think they should bring out a brand-new album and singles? I lean towards no. It’s all about celebration and nostalgia – I don’t think they’re coming for Little Mix’s wigs. They know they’re the elder stateswomen of the pop sphere.”Many of today’s pop musicians who were children during the Spice Girls’ heyday have cited them as an influence, from Adele to British avant-garde pop star Charli XCX and Danish singer MØ. The Spice Girls’ “girl power” message has also been cited as a cornerstone of many millennials’ grounding in feminism.“The band are relevant in the sense that girl power lives on in a generation of women who were introduced to a very basic interpretation of feminism two decades before books on the topic became the ultimate middle-class stocking filler,” said Robinson.Sawyer acknowledged that some people are “snotty” about their conception of feminism. “I understand why, but I think if you are a young girl and someone says ‘girl power’ to you, that is very important. Their idea that your girlfriends might be more important than the boys you were meant to be attracting is still quite a fundamental point really.”Said Bravo: “They gave us permission to be outspoken – ‘gobby’ was a word that was often flung around – and angry, and have an opinion whether or not we were considered qualified. That’s something we’re still struggling with today: who’s doing it right, who’s doing it wrong? They were criticised for being too brash, too commercial, but the fact that they were commercial and successful meant they reached a young audience, and that was their power.”Dazed digital editor Aimee Cliff questioned whether the Spice Girls’ “Thatcher-endorsing brand of girl power” would hold up. “Their patriotism and Union Jack-waving would feel hollow and Brexit-esque. Their unrelenting optimism would be at odds with a more cynical audience, and a bleaker time for the UK in general. Relevant? Maybe not. But the bangers are forever.” •\u0026nbspTickets for the tour go on sale at 10.30am on 10 November.

But it didn’t just happen. Out of the ashes of the defeated remain campaign in 2016 emerged a new political force: a set of activists and politicians with a vast database of supporters and a willingness to work across traditional party lines.  The driving force behind it all is the campaign’s director, James McGrory, a former special adviser to Nick Clegg. He’s been co-ordinating grassroots supporters, pro-remain MPs and fact-finding missions to Brussels. He tells Anushka Asthana that if the government cannot get a Brexit deal through parliament, a second referendum is the only way to settle the UK’s future relationship with the EU.

But the No 10 statement did not refer to the Irish concerns about unilateralism. A spokesman said the British and Irish leaders had agreed the backstop would be “a temporary arrangement”, and that May had emphasised that there would need to be “a mechanism through which the backstop could be brought to an end”.A backstop is deemed necessary to ensure there is no return to a hard border in Ireland, if the UK and the EU are unable to secure a long-term free trade deal after the end of the Brexit transition period in 2020. It involves some or all of the UK remaining in the customs union until agreement is reached.However, several cabinet members are concerned that the backstop arrangements could be used by the EU to put pressure on the UK after April when detailed free trade negotiations begin – and that the Britain could effectively be left in a long-term limbo, still in the customs union without any say in decision-making.It is not clear how far they will voice concerns to May at the cabinet meeting on Tuesday. “I think up to half the cabinet have talked about the importance of the UK being able to end the backstop, but I don’t know how many will raise that specifically at the meeting,” one cabinet source said.No 10 argued the British and Irish statements demonstrated that progress had been made, with the Irish signalling they were willing to discuss a review or mechanism for ending the backstop in principle. But Downing Street would not discuss its details, saying only that the UK was “seeking a mechanism” by which it could be ended.Coveney confirmed that Raab did ask the Irish for a three-month limit on the backstop when they met in London last week. “It was discussed, it was dismissed and made very clear that it was not a runner,” a spokesman for the foreign minister said, adding that the two men had a “robust discussion.”Raab declined to comment, although the minister has previously made clear that there needs to be finality to any backstop arrangements agreed.EU officials believe there needs to be “decisive progress” by the weekend for Donald Tusk, the European council president, to be able to announce a summit for the end of November. Without such a development, sources suggested the only viable option would be to leave the deal until the leaders’ summit in Brussels on 13 December.UK officials, however, suggested a summit could be called with a week’s notice, and were indicating that they believed one could be held in the week beginning 26 November, just before May and other leaders fly out on 29 November for the G20 in Argentina.There appears to be a softening on the EU side toward an all-UK customs union, which would replace the idea of a Northern Ireland-specific arrangement that has been repeatedly rejected by May and the UK government. But it would require an acceptance by Downing Street that it would in effect be a permanent arrangement, officials indicated.EU diplomats and officials recognise that the UK wants a breakthrough this week but there is deep scepticism in Brussels that it will be possible to find common ground on the most difficult areas in the next few days.British sources said that talks on the future economic partnership – the future trade deal – were as advanced as they could be without resolving the question of the backstop, which was expected to form a key part of the withdrawal agreement, the legally enforceable conditions by which the UK leaves the EU next March.Cabinet members were shown a 15-page-long draft at a meeting two weeks ago, which one person said was sufficiently broadly drafted that it could be interpreted as abandoning the Chequers insistence on the UK signing up to a common rulebook for food and goods that is hated by the Tory right. No 10 denied that Chequers has been dropped.

Binmen Jamal and Steve know this well. Every weekday, before they work their central London route, they are reminded by their depot foreman that as well as paper, plastic and aluminium, the containers they pick up may contain people.Finding people sheltering inside waste containers is relatively rare – millions of bins are emptied every year in the UK with nobody inside – but rising homelessness has meant it is an increasingly common situation, with the result that Jamal and Steve must look carefully before they tip waste into their lorry’s compressor, known as “the vulture”.“You can’t spot people if they’re sleeping under cardboard when you open the bin,” says Jamal, as he waits for the morning rush hour traffic to move. “If you don’t see them, they’ll get tipped in the back. It could kill them.”“A grizzly death,” adds Steve, who is driving the lorry.“I found people sleeping inside bins in an old job,” Jamal continues. “You think: what should I do? Wake them up?”Waste disposal companies have experienced the impact of this rise. Last winter, Veolia recorded 32 reports of people found inside their bins in the UK, up from 26 the year before. Biffa, which often operates larger commercial containers, discovered 175 people in its bins in 2016, and is set to launch its second major awareness campaign in two years about the issue in January. These figures rely on internal reporting and the true extent of the issue is unclear, but its consequences can be fatal.In 2014, the remains of a man were found by staff at a waste recycling plant in Bristol. Matthew Symonds, 34, had been sleeping in a waste bin under cardboard in Swindon after he was refused entry to a homeless shelter and was tipped into a bin lorry as he slept. A coroner was not able to establish exactly how he died, but noted his body suffered “significant disruption”.Rough sleepers are not the only people that die in this way. Some revellers climb into bins at the end of a night out, with fatal consequences. At least 11 people died between 2010 and 2016, according to previous reporting. The Health and Safety Executive told the  it had investigated three deaths resulting from people sleeping or sheltering in bins in the last two financial years for this article.Later this month, an inquest into the death of a homeless man who suffered crushing injuries to his legs after he was tipped into the back of a lorry as he slept in Rochester, Kent, in January will begin. A pre-inquest review heard that Russell Lane died during surgery weeks later from complications related to his injuries.The number of deaths means that checking bins for people has become a regular part of the health and safety routine for waste disposal companies. “From time to time, it is known that persons take refuge inside waste containers, particularly containers of 660ltr and larger,” reads the dry warning in a briefing at the depot where Jamal and Steve arrive at 5.30am every day.“Checking containers for persons prior to engaging on the lifting mechanism is quick, simple and straightforward and could save someone’s life,” it continues. Staff are told to watch out for rucksacks, sleeping bags and food near the bin, which might indicate someone is inside. If they find someone, they’re told to report it immediately.Despite the health and safety fears, waste containers remain a key part of survival on the street. In the maze of underpasses underneath the roundabout by Waterloo station, long-term rough sleeper Jimmy, a 51-year-old Glaswegian, was sheltering from the torrential rain outside surrounded by his possessions.“Cardboard keeps you off the concrete. It’s the best thing there is, isn’t it?” tapping the blankets around him, which are supported by a thick stack of cardboard. “It’s so important. Rain is our worst enemy. If you get wet then that’s it.”The army veteran, who started sleeping rough after his partner died during a miscarriage and he started experiencing mental health problems, said there are often better places to sleep rough than bins in London, but they can provide a break from the dangers of sleeping outside.“I had a friend who nearly got tipped in. We’d been drinking and it started to rain, so he jumped in for a nap. When the binmen came, he nearly got put in the back. He jumped out just in time,” he said.“I used to sleep in a bin shed in Kennington when I was travelling,” he added, continuing to talk about the dangers of the street. Jimmy recalled waking up one night to a man preparing to urinate on him. Others have tried to destroy his possessions.On their round, Steve and Jamal are aware of these issues and are careful not to throw the possessions of people who might be rough sleeping into the back of their lorry. The pair spend a large part of their morning removing food and dog poo from the recycling bins, but often leave cardboard on the side of a street where they know rough sleepers need it.Steve points at the stacks of cardboard. “It shows you the reality of what’s going on, that someone has to do that,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc487dfc4b1ae6d27ad443170aeeb18aef77255c/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f290d31985bfdbef8b318e14816d589","title":"tell us has your company adopted a living wage policy","story":"We want to hear from readers working for companies paying Living Wage Foundation rates as an increase is announcedStaff of some 4,700 employers who have adopted a voluntary living wage policy are in line for an inflation-beating pay rise.The foundation’s figures are £1.17 higher an hour than the national living wage imposed by the government for workers over the age of 25.

When I met Miguel Induráin he got embarrassed. I don’t like it when people do it to me. I say, ‘I’ve moved on. He’s gone now, that person.’”The book is called Icons. It’s rather beautiful and an intriguing blend of cycling history and personal snippets which offer insight into Wiggins’ contradictions. The “proper nerd” he used to be, as a cycling-obsessed teenager living on a London council estate, shines through some endearing pages about the bike riders who consumed him when he fell for a brutal and complicated sport.Yet it is striking that a man steeped in cycling history should avoid acknowledging in the book that Icons features many dopers. Wiggins, instead, writes that “romance is the soul of cycling.” The romance, however, has been stripped by allegations and denials of cheating – and by open confessions of persistent doping.Wiggins’ own story is tarnished. His life is nothing like it was in 2012, when he won the Tour de France and Olympic gold while being celebrated as a British icon who could do little wrong. In March 2018 a parliamentary culture, media and sport select committee published a devastating report which claimed Team Sky had abused the anti-doping system and allowed Wiggins to use triamcinolone before the 2012 Tour. The report concluded that Sky had “crossed an ethical line” in obtaining therapeutic use exemption forms to enable Wiggins to take triamcinolone which, apart from helping his asthma, enhanced his power-to-weight ratio. Sky and Wiggins reject the charge. The impasse has taken its toll with no one able to prove whether or not triamcinolone had been sent in Sky’s notorious Jiffy bag.As an ardent collector of cycling memorabilia, Wiggins estimates “I could make a phone call tomorrow and sell the whole collection for half a million.” But his love of cycling has been regenerated by the book, which features evocative items given to him by the chosen Icons. “Cycling means the world to me and I’ve gone back, no chains attached. No political correctness. I’m not with a team that’s agenda-led – or want me to be careful about mentioning Lance Armstrong. I say what I like. It’s good to go back to when I fell in love with cycling aged 13. Growing up in Kilburn I could have ended up somewhere very different. Some would say I’d have been better off being killed or in prison.”Wiggins looks up. “I was a kid living in Kilburn in the early 1990s, with pictures of Belgian cyclists on my wall. There has probably never been a kid in Kilburn, before or since, who had a bedroom wall like that.”Everything became worse two years ago when Fancy Bears hackers released documents showing Wiggins had been given permission to use triamcinolone, a banned corticosteroid, for medical reasons with the appropriate TUEs, before races in 2011, 2012 and 2013. “People have free rein to put their own facts in place. Kids read headlines and their parents say things about you. You end up saying to your kids: ‘Just tell them to fucking do one.’ They do and it’s your kids in trouble.“Then the BBC show up on your doorstep and you can’t take your kids to school. You tell the BBC, ‘I can’t talk to you, because there’s an investigation.’ They just want to know about the packages. The whole thing becomes an uncontrolled trial by media. In any other court it would be thrown out because the media have skewed the facts.These personal words about his family provide a salutary reminder to those who have been so vehement. An ordinary family has been scorched but there is also hope when I ask how Cath is today. “Really good now. She’s moving on.”Wiggins’s anger is still palpable. “What I should have done,” he says, “is murder someone because then I’d have had proper rights. I’d have had more rights as a murderer. There’d have been no articles and I’d have had a fair trial. I’d have been cleared or found guilty. Not somewhere in the middle where you can’t find any evidence of wrongdoing.”Has Wiggins accepted his name has been tainted? “Yeah. I understand that not everyone’s going to like you. I don’t like everyone. It’s made me be myself more and say what I think.”Will the truth ever be established – especially as Wiggins said earlier this year that “very sinister” details surrounded the Jiffy-bag scandal and he would “love it to come out.” He nods. “There’s a lot more going on than I alluded to this summer. I can’t prove any of it yet. It might take five years and, in the interim, I’m carrying on with my life.”I am a sucker for many of the book’s stories. Wiggins’s first chosen icon is Johan Museeuw, the Belgian who won both Paris-Roubaix and the Tour of Flanders on three separate occasions. Flanders was the first race Wiggins watched, live on Eurosport in 1993, when he was 13. Museeuw won and Brad was thrilled because, in those pre-internet days, he usually had to wait until Cycling Weekly arrived at his local newsagent on a Thursday to find out who had won Flanders the previous weekend.In 1996 Wiggins and his brother were taken by their mum to see Museeuw race in Flanders. Wiggins was almost beside himself but, being 16, he was “too cool for school”. He forced his eight-year-old brother to approach the cyclists. “He was acting as a proxy for me because I didn’t want to come across as the smitten, star-struck teenager I was.”At his final Tour of Flanders, in 2015, Wiggins stressed how much Musseuw had meant to him. They swapped messages on Instagram. Musseuw’s 15-year-old son was a Wiggins fan and the circle was complete. The only problem was that when they met, and Museeuw gave him his 1993 jersey, Wiggins felt like a tongue-tied teenager again while the middle-aged icon had a high-pitched voice which “seemed the opposite of the ferocious rider he’d once been.”It’s a lovely story but Wiggins looks surprised when I ask him why he does not mention Museeuw’s confession in 2007 that he “did not play the game honestly” and, like most cyclists of his era, had used EPO. In a 2012 Cycling Weekly interview Museeuw said of doping: “We must break with the hypocrisy. The only way to come out of that murderous spiral is to break the silence that haunts us.”Surely Wiggins could follow his boyhood hero and write honestly about cycling’s dark history? “I didn’t because I’ve gone back to when I was 13 and didn’t know about EPO. I took all that out, not because I condone it, but because I can’t change who inspired me. I was inspired by their feats on the bike and the memories of them coming into the velodrome at Roubaix regardless of whether they were on EPO. In hindsight, they probably were. But it was like, ‘Fuck me, this is what I want to do. I have to get out of Kilburn and live in Belgium.”Armstrong’s doping has been documented so thoroughly I can’t feel outraged by his presence in Wiggins’ book. But Wiggins suggests that, “Henri Desgrange, the ‘father of the Tour’, envisaged a ‘perfect winner’… a super athlete who would not only defeat his opponents but whatever nature might throw at him … it explains why Tour winners tended to be masochistic, obsessive and, on occasion, borderline sociopathic.” Wiggins concludes that Armstrong was “precisely the sort of winner Desgrange had in mind 120 years ago.”Are he and Armstrong close today? “Not in terms of being really friendly but we have mutual respect. I talk to him fairly regularly.”We return to the subject of doping and Icons. Both Jacques Anquetil, the first man to win the Tour de France five times in the 1960s, and Fausto Coppi, who twice won the double of the Giro d’Italia and the Tour in 1949 and 1952, admitted they had doped at a time when there was little scrutiny of such habits. Anquetil said: “Leave me in peace. Everybody takes dope.”Wiggins reiterates his romantic reasons for glossing over this truth. And yet, writing about another of his heroes, Induráin, Wiggins states: “He rode during the EPO years and yet he’s the Tour winner that nobody has ever gone after … Induráin’s morality is bomb-proof.”The Spaniard tested positive for salbutamol in 1994 but the head of the IOC’s medical commission led the defence by stressing that Induráin needed the prescribed and legitimate medication for his asthma. He was cleared. Even though he remains in the records books as an unequivocally clean cyclist who was never banned, Induráin’s reputation has been questioned repeatedly by dubious fans. Induráin has always denied any wrongdoing at any stage of his career.“He is described as the perfect gentleman” Wiggins says of Induráin. “You could find him in bed with your wife and he’d give you a hug. He’d make you think it was your idea. He was just that kind of fellow, such a nice person. I don’t think he had one enemy in the peloton. He gifted people stages because it was enough for him to win the Tour. He wasn’t greedy.”Induráin’s supporters, like a young Wiggins, appear even more certain of his innocence. So does it irk Wiggins that Froome, his former rival at Sky, could join Anquetil and Induráin by winning a fifth Tour next year? “Not at all. Chris is a great athlete and I’m sure he’ll do it. I don’t think G can match him in the climbs. G’s great on the cobblestones but an on-form Chris beats him. Regardless of what we think of each other as people, he’ll go down as, if not the greatest of his generation, one of the best.”Wiggins is scathing towards Dave Brailsford – his former boss at Sky. He loves Sean Yates, a former team-mate of Armstrong who also worked for Team Sky and helped Wiggins win the Tour in 2012. Yates was eased out of Sky in October 2012. “They said his health was the reason but they got rid of him because of the association with Lance. That’s typical Dave and Sky. As long as it looks good on paper, fuck what it’s actually like behind the scenes.”Wiggins sees the threads of history tying him, Froome and Thomas, as Tour winners, to great riders of the past. “We watched Geraint win the Tour and saw Sky take a six-storey office block of a bus. Dave’s got his own mobile home that he sleeps in. Think of Coppi winning the Tour in 1949. The last three stages were 900km. The last stage into Paris was 350km. It took them 12 hours to do it. You didn’t get into a bus then or talk about marginal gains. You didn’t do a warm-down before the podium. Fuck the warm-down. I’ve just done 350km.“But for all the differences we’re in the same club as Coppi. We won the Tour and we’re steeped in that unique history. As much as the sport has changed we’re still trekking across the mountains in France, maybe on better bikes, better equipment, better roads, bigger crowds. It’s still the same climbs. But I sense Coppi’s greatness. You imagine little towns in the Dolomites that wouldn’t get newspapers or TV. They would hear that Coppi was coming past. People would put the wheelbarrows down and come out to get a glimpse of Coppi. There’s something beautiful about that.”Won’t he be nervous? ‘No. I’ll be great. Being myself is enough.”What will he do if, shortly before his first performance, all the past pain rises up again? Wiggins sinks back in his chair and smiles. “I’ll just have a bottle of red.

Tickets for England’s 12-11 victory over South Africa ranged from £55 to £132.After the full-time whistle, Jones said the All Blacks would have watched the match on TV at their Teddington hotel “drinking cups of tea, maybe having some scones, saying ‘oh, we’ll take these guys’. They’ll be confident and we can’t wait to get them.”But on Monday the New Zealand second-row Brodie Retallick revealed otherwise.“We were actually at the stadium so we weren’t having scones or a cup of tea,” he said. “It was physical, it’s probably not the style of rugby we’re used to but they’re extremely good at what they did. I thought they did a great job.”Steve Hansen was not at Twickenham. The All Blacks coach arrived in the UK on Sunday along with nine players who took part in Saturday’s win over Japan in Tokyo, but after catching up with England’s nail-biting victory over the Springboks, he is expecting another arm wrestle this weekend.“A lot of people make mistakes about England and they are quite critical,” he said. “They play different than we do, it’s not to say they play a better game or a worse game, they just play differently. They are a hard team to play against and they showed that on Saturday. They didn’t have a lot of ball but they hung in there and won a game they probably didn’t feel they’d played their best but they still won. That’s the mark of a good side.”Hansen revealed he speaks to the England coach as regularly as every two weeks and acknowledged Jones’s record – five wins from 11 matches – against the All Blacks is impressive. “He’s got a tremendous work ethic, he does a lot of homework and through that homework he will have identified some areas he’ll want to try to target on Saturday,” Hansen said. “Does it give him any better idea than anyone else? Maybe, but there’s a lot of good coaches out there. To win a Test match against a good opposition side you’ve got to do your homework and get things to fall your way a little bit. He’s had some success against New Zealand in the past, and hopefully he doesn’t get any on Saturday.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/235a3c50eb3dee45051a135d7483103fef2b8040/0_197_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbfbc88ceaefb7f809a2fbe8d207a2ab","title":"usoc decertifying usa gymnastics ngb","story":"The US Olympic Committee has taken the first steps to decertifying USA Gymnastics’ recognition as the national governing body for gymnastics in the United States.The decision to mete out the so-called “nuclear option” comes after years of criticism regarding the organization’s handling of sexual assault complaints, including those which culminated in the sex-abuse scandal involving former team doctor Larry Nassar.“This is a situation in which there are no perfect solutions,” USOC CEO Sarah Hirshland said in a statement. “Seeking to revoke recognition is not a conclusion that we have come to easily. In the short-term, we have to work to ensure that USAG gymnasts have the support necessary to excel on and off the field of play. We are building plans to do just that.“In the long-term, it will be the critically important responsibility of the recognized Gymnastics NGB, whether the existing organization or a new one, to lead gymnastics in the United States and build on the supportive community of athletes and clubs that can carry the sport forward for decades to come. We are prepared to identify and help build such an organization.”In an open letter to the gymnastics community, Hirshland said the challenges facing USA Gymnastics “are simply more than it is capable of overcoming in its current form”.USA Gymnastics came under intense criticism after an Indianapolis Star investigative report published shortly before the 2016 Olympics revealed several top executives dismissed or failed to properly alert authorities when notified of allegations of sexual abuse, ultimately leading to the resignation of president Steve Penny in March 2017. Five of the organization’s 21 board members resigned in the immediate wake of Nassar’s sentencing to an effective life prison sentence in January 2018, with the remaining directors all stepping down by the end of the month under threat of decertification by the USOC.Kerry Perry, who had succeeded Penny as chief executive officer and president and whose brief tenure will be most remembered for a disastrous appearance on Capitol Hill, was forced to resign in September. Her interim replacement, Mary Bono, lasted only four days after it was revealed her previous law firm helped conceal Nassar’s crimes.This is a developing story that will be updated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82d7fe4ff90f58121a9a734c61cdea6b71a3aad2/376_49_3036_1822/master/3036.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=881501535879eb66e0f34a15f626e8ba","title":"floyd mayweather kick boxing ego","story":"Five-weight former world champion has agreed to take on a 20-year-old Japanese kickboxer in what is the latest of the bored American’s money-making stuntsEvaluating the absurd in boxing is like trying to break open a coconut with a feather: intriguing but pointless – yet Floyd Mayweather manages to take us to that place time and again.After coming out of retirement to entertain and hugely enrich Conor McGregor (and himself) with gloves in August 2017, the 41-year-old enigma says he has agreed to swap blows of a variety yet to be determined in Japan on New Year’s Eve with Tenshin Nasukawa, an acclaimed kickboxer who is 5ft 4in, 8st 6lb and 21 years younger than a hall-of-fame boxer who won world titles at five weights over 17 years. It is farcical in every way – even if they were trying to crack a coconut.Nevertheless, Nasukawa can hardly believe his luck. If they box, he will willingly take his lumps, like McGregor, to earn more money than his own sport could ever deliver if they cobble together a hybrid contest, likewise. It will prove nothing – apart from confirming PT Barnum’s infamous phrase “There’s a sucker born every minute”.Interested parties will try to generate discussion about the outcome, as if it somehow mattered. It will not be a lot different from an eerily similar and comic crossover fight in Japan in 1976, when Muhammad Ali, his mind and body suffering from the years he gave his sport, crossed legs (painfully) with the wrestler Antonio Inoki, another hometown hero. It has been claimed, retrospectively, that the bout was a precursor of mixed martial arts, which underpins that other profitable offshoot, UFC.Even writing this lends a form of legitimacy to the Mayweather- Nasukawa exercise but that is what much of modern sport has become: a rolling stunt.And, for purists, this is the sad part: Mayweather is one of the all-time great defensive boxers, a master of time and space, a true artist in an arcane medium. However, there seems to be no saving him from his own ego, born of boredom in semi-retirement as he dreams up his next photo-op, nor his propensity to value his worth almost purely in terms of money.Money defines him. It is the nickname he chose over “Pretty Boy” in his early-career descent into all-out narcissism. Accumulating more money than anyone has ever managed in his sport is, for him, the gauge of greatness. He used to say he rarely needed his “A-game” to win a fight and often that was true. He had more gears than a Ferrari and some times he was up against no more than a pram but he always came away with the bigger purse.There will always be one comparison that matters, in boxing terms, though: that with Sugar Ray Leonard, to whom Mayweather owes much in style and attitude. And Leonard, whose self-belief was as strong as Mayweather’s, still has no doubt as to who would win had it been possible for them to share a ring.Asked on Undisputed Live on US television last week (when the talk was still of Mayweather fighting either Manny Pacquiao a second time, or the unbeaten UFC fighter, Khabib Nurmagomedov), “At your greatest, were you were better than Floyd?”, Leonard could give only one answer: “Absolutely. My mindset always told me I could beat Mayweather, I could beat Tyson. That’s what made me who I became.”Leonard’s further exploration of the Mayweather mystique was more interesting than anything uttered recently in boxing.How would he beat him? “There’s no one way to beat Floyd Mayweather. He’s that good, he’s that talented. You walk in there with a plan but to execute it takes time … see what he goes for. Nobody could penetrate his defence. He was one of the best guys out there. I would say body shots but it’s so hypothetical.And so we are all dragged towards another Mayweather show. Three years after his last proper fight (McGregor was a glorified spar), when he embarrassed an ageing Andre Berto, he is still able to command the attention of everyone in the fight business. He makes money. For everyone. And, for everyone, that is all that matters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c6827e51bbb6f1b81d40d3fa7fecfbea297e7de/0_285_4066_2440/master/4066.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9973d9538ecf421f74d33fe170d920b2","title":"amazon second hq two locations cities","story":"Company will ide its workforce with 25,000 workers in each of two cities, Wall Street Journal saysAmazon is planning to split its second headquarters evenly between two locations rather than picking one city, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing a person familiar with the matter.The retailer previously announced a planned investment of $5bn and 50,000 jobs for the second headquarters.Under the new plan, the e-commerce giant will split the workforce with 25,000 employees in each city, the WSJ report said.The company’s motive behind the decision is recruiting enough tech talent, the report said.A decision and announcement could come as soon as this week, according to the newspaper.The WSJ reported on Sunday that Seattle-based Amazon was in advanced talks with Dallas, New York, the Crystal City area of northern Virginia and a few other candidates for the location of its second headquarters.Amazon declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4bf88358ef51f073e739a7adf8cd97cbbdb305f/0_277_2000_1199/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35f3852fff3de57b8404f64f4e59fe0f","title":"pret a porter marliyn stafford 1960 paris montmartre","story":"In 1950s Paris, photographer Marilyn Stafford was commissioned to capture the glamour and elegance of a new fashion concept – prêt-à-porter.She took models out of the studios and into the gritty working-class areas of the French capital, where they attracted the attention of curious children playing in the streets.The result was a collection of black-and-white photographs showcasing the likes of Chanel and Givenchy that reflect both the style and the darker, dirtier side of the City of Light.In this shot, a pouting child in a well-worn dress and scuffed boots sits perched on railings on the Montmartre steps, in stark contrast to the designer-clad model who is gesturing theatrically.“I loved the streets. I wasn’t so interested in the clothes – I was looking for interesting places, backgrounds, passageways and alleys,” Stafford says.“And in those days if you were a woman out in Paris with a camera, you had kids following you.”Stafford, who was born in Ohio in 1925, initially worked as a singer after arriving in postwar Paris, performing at a club near the Champs Élysées, where she met Edith Piaf, Charles Aznavour and Bing Crosby, as well as the French photographers Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert Capa.After her voice failed, she took the Rolleiflex camera she used for “casual snaps” and sought advice from Cartier-Bresson – who let Stafford watch him while he worked – and Capa, who suggested that she join him in documenting the war in Indochina (where he was later killed).Shunning the battlefields, Stafford, who turns 93 tomorrow, went on to report from around the world, including for the Observer.Today, Stafford admits there was another reason for using the street as a fashion backdrop: “I had no studio.

It is breathtaking how quickly and easily it is done. They threaten to harm Ana’s family – they know her mother’s name and address – if she screams or tries to escape. She is taken to Ireland and stripped of her passport, glasses and phone before being forced to “do money” in a series of brothels (doors locked, windows nailed shut) across the country. “Nobody knows where I am,” she says in a voiceover. “Not even me.”At least until her first client arrives. “Welcome to Galway,” he says as he unbuckles his belt. He’s not sinister. He’s an ordinary man who has paid his money. Ana fights him off. “She’s mad!” he shouts in outrage. “Fine way to treat an honest customer.”The man who snatched her off the street rapes her instead. His female partner-in-crime tells Ana that there will be no food unless she works. And so she works. The pimps charge extra for anal sex, sex without a condom and for special services, such as those for the men who want to beat up Ana in addition to raping her.Interwoven with this unflinching portrayal of the brutality she suffers at the hands of her pimps and of ordinary men – there is a spike in business on Thursday evenings because it is when wives go late-night shopping – is the story of the police investigating and trying to prosecute those responsible. In one raid, the chance of rescue seems possible, but all the police find is evidence of a tenancy agreement and client lists in her name. Ana now has a criminal record and returns to her pimps even more vulnerable, effectively shackled to them.A second raid is more carefully planned by a team experienced in the field of tracking and trying to prosecute modern slavers and endlessly frustrated by their lack of power. You can’t remove an adult woman from her situation without her consent and the abused women they meet are too terrified to give it. “I’m happy,” mutters the youngest of Ana’s fellow captives (delivered to the gang the day after her 18th birthday by a boyfriend who told her he was bringing her in for webcam work) as the police question their status in front of their pimp. “I’m free.”The sketching of the police investigation and the difficulties they face is possibly done too lightly in a film that is clearly intended as agitprop. The investigators need to be more than ciphers and the law’s inadequacies and otiose requirements need to be hammered home at least as hard as the horrors the women suffer, because we are unlikely to feel the same emotional response to the former as we do to the latter.That emotional response also allows the viewer to skim over an underpowered script and some narrative solutions that seem rather too neat to be true, even if – such is the weird way storytelling on screen works – they are. Take, for example, the local gangster who turns out to have a heart of gold and the relative ease with which Ana decides to testify against those who held her.Vitally, however, neither of these flaws is great enough to detract from the power of and the suffering in Ana’s story. Her experience is representative of the 5 million women and girls who, we are told in a caption at the end, endured such sexual exploitation last year. The real Ana’s testimony in parliament in Belfast helped secure the passing of the Human Trafficking and Exploitation Act – the first new law against slavery in the UK for nearly 200 years.I don’t like to think what this says about how far we have come in the intervening years. But one thing I like to think about even less is that, among all the women watching this programme and thinking: “There but for the grace of God,” and all the men watching aghast at this awful underbelly of the world, there will be a tiny fraction who look at the pimps or the rapists they facilitate and think: “There’s an idea …” And so the world turns.If you suspect anyone to be a victim of human trafficking, you can contact the Modern Slavery Helpline on 08000 121700.

It is a horrible thing. It is just going to get worse. So many people are leaving the city, running away. They are targeting the activists, saying we are promoting homosexuality. We have to hide.”Another activist in the city described the atmosphere as “open season on gay people” and reported lists of names being published on social media to “out people”.“You can imagine what that is doing to people, to families,” he said.The Tanzanian foreign ministry has said Makonda’s campaign represents his own views and not the official government position.But officials have repeatedly backed a series of homophobic measures since John Magufuli became president in 2015 on an anti-graft platform.Campaign groups have accused Tanzania of following a “dangerous path”. The country also faces growing criticism over alleged human rights abuses.Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International’s regional director for east Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes, said: “The idea of this taskforce … serves to incite hatred among members of the public. LGBTI people in Tanzania already face discrimination, threats and attacks without hateful statements of this kind.”In 2016, Tanzania banned nongovernmental organisations from distributing free lube to gay people as part of efforts to control the spread of HIVAids, even though some health experts warned shutting down such outreach programmes could put the wider population at higher risk of infection.In a raid last year, at least 12 men were arrested at a Dar es Salaam hotel at a gathering that authorities said was to promote same-sex relationships.Homosexuality remains taboo across much of Africa and gay people face discrimination or persecution, with human rights groups often reluctant to speak publicly in defence of gay rights.A conviction for having “carnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature” can lead to up to 30 years in jail in Tanzania.Two opposition leaders were sentenced to five months in prison in February for insulting Magufuli, and a Tanzanian opposition leader was charged on Friday with sedition and inciting hatred, days after he said scores died in clashes between security forces and herders in his western home district, a statement that was dismissed by authorities.Zitto Kabwe, a frequent government critic, told a news conference on Sunday that at least 100 people died during clashes in Kigoma in mid-October.He was detained three days later, then charged in court on Friday and released on a 10 million shilling (£3,400) bond, his Alliance for Change and Transparency party said.Kigoma’s police commander, Martin Ottieno, told Reuters that two herders and two officers had died during an operation to stop the former keeping livestock illegally on a government-owned ranch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4d3ade5e5451e360b1bf2f2a293ed360f135124/666_848_6054_3632/master/6054.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67c13d5a6ce0e86a559cec16a3457375","title":"tell us about the things you do that represent non capitalist living","story":"From freecycling to volunteering, we’d like to hear about the things you do that go against the capitalist and consumerist grain“Most of us would say, if asked, that we live in a capitalist society, but vast amounts of how we live our everyday lives - our interactions with and commitments to family lives, friendships, avocations, membership in social, spiritual and political organisations - are in essence non capitalist or even anticapitalist, full of things we do for free, out of love and on principle.”The positive flipside of the internet age, of course, is that such things are now comparatively easy to get going, and then publicise.

Struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, the agreement limited the Iranian programme – reassuring the rest of the world that it would be unable to develop nuclear weapons – in return for sanctions relief.All nuclear-related sanctions were lifted in January 2016, reconnecting Iran to global markets. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN body in the charge of policing the agreement, has verified 12 times since the agreement that Tehran has complied with its terms.Donald Trump promised to “dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran” long before he was elected president in November 2016. Trump believes the agreement is a bad deal, which falls short of addressing Iran’s regional behaviour or its missile programme. He is emboldened by a group of Iran hawks in his inner circle, such as the national security adviser, John Bolton, and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo.Critics also say it is another example of Trump dismantling Barack Obama’s legacy – the Iran deal was his signature foreign policy achievement.Initially Trump reluctantly waived a raft of sanctions against Iran. But in May, the US withdrew from the agreement and Trump announced he would impose “the highest level of economic sanctions” on Iran, violating an international nuclear agreement and a UN resolution, and breaking decisively with US allies in Europe.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with Iran were a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – plus Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. Apart from the US under Trump, all other signatories have remained adamant that the agreement is working and want to keep it.Trump’s first set of sanctions were reimposed in August. Those measures hit the country’s access to the dollar, gold and precious metals and the car-making sector, amid growing street protests. They were followed by a set of additional, and even more stringent measures that came into force on Monday, including an embargo on the imports of Iranian oil and sanctions on its banking sector.In October, The UN’s international court of justice (ICJ) reprimanded the US over its reimposition of sanctions on Iran, ordering Washington to lift restrictive measures linked to humanitarian trade, food, medicine and civil aviation.Sanctions have returned at a critical time for Iran. A combination of factors ranging from economic grievances and lack of social and political freedoms to international pressure and sanctions has put the country under unprecedented pressure.Europe has set up a mechanism to sidestep those measures. European diplomats hope the proposed measure – known as a special purpose vehicle (SPV) – will help persuade an increasingly reluctant Iran to stay inside the deal in the hope of rescuing its economy."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3684334.1541183727!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"families feel the pinch as cost of living rises to over 50 000 a year","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Those who bought a property at the height of the boom might find themselves spending €52,593 a year. Those who bought this year could spend a total of €47,623 over the next 12 months. Photograph: iStockWhen the cost of groceries, mortgage payments, utility bills, motoring, phones, the most modest of social lives, home insurance, car insurance, school and childcare and all the other things that most of us consider essential to live are totted up, a typical family who bought even a small home during the boom years are likely to spend more than €50,000 over the next 12 months.That is an after-tax figure and goes some way towards explaining why two adults earning an average wage still struggle to keep their heads above water despite the fact the economy has recovered in recent years.According to independent figures compiled by this newspaper, coupled with the seventh annual cost-of-living survey published this morning by AA Home Insurance, prices in key areas have climbed over the last 12 months and have largely wiped out any savings that people can expect as a result of tax changes rolled out in last month’s budget.According to the figures from the AA, the annual cost of owning and maintaining a family home now stands at €16,374, an increase of over €350 compared with 2017. And that figure does not include food, entertainment, education, clothes or any of the other things people need to stay alive.The AA carries out a detailed calculation each year which looks at the total cost of owning a house and subsequently running one in Ireland. Mortgage and property tax are calculated based on the current average property price. All other expenditure – from broadband and heating to the cost of domestic appliances – is researched and calculated according to prices as of October 2018.Looking at the figures going back several years suggests Irish consumers have been on a real rollercoaster of costs over the past decade.In 2007, when the average cost of buying a home was €344,000, the annual cost of servicing that home – including mortgage repayments – was €21,344.08. In 2014, with average house prices at €193,000\u0026nbspthe cost of running a home fell to €15,891.67.In 2015, with the average house price nationally at €205,000, the AA put the cost of running a home at €15,156, while in 2016 with average house prices at €215,000, the cost was €15,876.45. Last year, the average house price was €228,000 and the AA yearly figure was €16,006.62.This year it is €16,374.45 as the average property asking price climbed to €243,000.Increases in mortgage repayments and a jump in energy costs are the key drivers behind the €350 per annum increase in the annual cost of owning and maintaining a family home – the third successive year the costs have climbed, the “Cost of Running a Home” analysis suggests.That figure is a key reason why many of us are not feeling any real impact from a sustained economic recovery.The increase in the cost of running a home comes following a rise in the national average price of a second-hand home in Ireland. Values increased from €224,500 during the third quarter of last year to €243,000 in the third quarter of this year.Those who took out a 90 per cent mortgage this year are likely to pay €10,069.08 per annum – an increase of 1.86 per cent on last year.“Another year of rising household costs is the last thing that homeowners would have wanted to hear but it is, unfortunately, the situation that we find ourselves in,” says Conor Faughnan, the AA’s Director of Consumer Affairs.“While the continued climb of house prices has been one of the major stories of 2018, it’s not just the cost of mortgage repayments or getting your foot on the property ladder that have risen in the past 12 months,” he adds.“Home heating and electricity costs have also surged in the past year, meaning that even those who were fortunate enough to acquire their home when property prices were a little lower have seen their wallets take a significant hit.He says “urgent action in terms of the available housing stock is needed” if the issue of rising house prices is to be tackled “but questions also need to be asked of what supports can be made available to those struggling to meet these costs”.While the AA bases its calculations on those of a new buyer, there is also the “negative equity generation” – homeowners who bought their house at the peak of the boom. And the picture painted for this cohort is bleaker still.According to the AA figures, the group who bought a house in 2007 at the very height of the boom, pays €5,605.44 more on their mortgage repayments than their counterparts who purchased their homes in the third quarter of this year.Maintenance, repair and contingency funds is the second single most expensive bill for Irish householders and has increased by 0.7 per cent on 2017. The AA estimates that the average homeowner is likely to spend or set aside €1,255.56 each year to keep up with wear and tear. This figure equates to almost 8 per cent of the overall estimated cost of owning and running a home.Taking annual average usage figures of 11,000 kWh and 4,200 kWh for a three- or four-bedroom detached house respectively, the AA estimates that the average homeowner will spend €785.90 – an increase of 11 per cent – heating their home this year and a further €1,047.33 on electricity – also an increase of 11 per cent.Among the variables that remained the same as or close to last year were television licence costs at €160, property tax at €405, and AA Home Membership at €125.88.Other costs included in the AA Home Insurance study were: home insurance which is calculated at about €566.98, telephone and broadband bills at €434.62, household appliances at €550, household cleaning products at €311.03 and domestic refuse collection at €306.07.Last year the price of home insurance was put at €547.81 while telephone and broadband bills were averaged at €468.66. The cost of household appliances was said to be €573.82 while the cost of household cleaning products was put at at €281.85 and domestic refuse collection, which costs an average of €304.51.The AA figures, while comprehensive, only look at the costs of keeping a roof over your head and don’t factor in fairly important elements such as food, transport and all the other things that most people would struggle to live without.To work out how much a typical family of two adults and two children will need to spend over the next 12 months, we used the standard financial statement that banks ask customers to fill in if they are trying to restructure debts. Among the costs covered are health insurance, transport expenses, food, clothes and grooming, entertainment, childcare, education and mobile phones. So, how are those costs bearing up this year?There is a huge number of plans and a huge number of variables when it comes to health insurance. We compared three broadly similar family-friendly plans. Laya Healthcare’s Essential Connect Family plan will cost two adults and two children €3,081 compared with €3,052 last year. The VHI’s Family Plan Level 1 will cost €2,537, down from €2,805 last year. A Family Focus plan from Irish Life Health, meanwhile, is €3,673 – the same as last year. The average comes out at €3,097, compared with €3,176 in 2017.The average motorist drives 16,000km (9,900 miles) every year and the average price of petrol is €1.44 a litre. Driving the average family car, which does 12.4km per litre (35 miles per gallon), the average Irish driver will spend about €1,857 on petrol compared with €1,755 last year – and €1,664 in 2016.The cost of comprehensive insurance for two adults depends on many factors – notably location, driving history, no-claims bonus and type of car – and although prices have fallen back slightly compared with last year’s highs, our notional family can expect to have little change out of €1,150 this year.The average annual motor tax is €408 per motorist while at least €400 will have to be put aside to cover servicing and maintenance. If you spend €10,000 on a car, keep it for five years and then sell it for half the price you paid for it, the annual cost is €1,000, which takes the total running costs to €4,815 – last year we put that cost at €4,545.There has not been much movement in supermarket prices over the last year – either up or down so if the average Irish household spends €175 a week on groceries, the total bill will come in at €9,100 compared with €8,840 last year, although that doesn’t factor in a Christmas blow-out of any kind.According to the Insolvency Service of Ireland expenditure guidelines, the minimum an adult needs to cover the cost of “social inclusion” is €28.97 a week – and that is to cover the cost of “sports activities and social events such as visits to the cinema”. That seems somewhat mean to us so it we give each adult an extra tenner a week to blow on themselves and an extra €10 to cover each child each week, the annual spend on social inclusion for a family of four will come to €5,092.Education and childcare: €7,745According to the annual school costs survey published by Barnardos in August when the cost of clothes, shoes, books, stationery, classroom resources and the voluntary contribution are totted up, a child going into senior infants will cost €360, while the cost of sending a child into secondary school climbs to €765. If we allow a further €500 to cover costs for trips and extra-curricular activities and assume our notional household has one child in senior infants class and one in first year, then the annual cost of a free education climbs to €1,625 – down slightly on last year’s figure.Schools in Ireland are obliged to open for 183 days a year, so if both parents are working, then after-school childcare costs will have to be added to the bill. Our notional family have found themselves a childminder who charges €170 a week for the school year of 36 weeks, which is a total each year of €6,120. Combining that and the education costs, the total spend rises to €7,745.Assuming the man in our notional household visits the barber eight times a year and his partner visits a hairdressers once every 10 weeks (plus once for a special occasion), the total cost of haircare alone will reach €800. If the family then spends just €50 a month on clothes, the amount needed rises to €1,400.When you put it all together, that means the average person who bought a home at the average price in 2018 could easily spend a total of €47,623 over the next 12 months. Those who bought a property at the height of the boom might find themselves spending €52,593. And that is without taking any holidays or factoring in Christmas, birthdays or anything that could be classified as a significant treat over the course of a year.Given that there aren’t very many households where the combined pre-tax income tops €100,000, is it any wonder so many people are still feeling the pinch?"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3687405.1541453791!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tyrrelstown primary schools may reopen this week","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Tyrrelstown Educate Together School, Dublin: the board of management was not satisfied that the internal work had left the interior in a fit state for children to return.

Other classes will be temporarily housed off-site.The school had outlined a list of concerns to the department, which was working on completing these requests within the next day or two. Once this was completed, it would make a decision on whether to reopen.“We appreciate this is an uncertain time for parents and is causing a lot of issues. However, the board of management’s priority is child safety and until we are fully satisfied in this regard, the school will remain closed.”St Luke’s school said it had concerns that work to make the school safe had not been finished to a high enough standard.

Impending disaster is painfully apparent and yet, time and again, councillors willingly and wilfully hurl themselves lemming-like over cliffs to lose their limited powers in the ravine at the bottom.In 2001, councillors – all councillors not just Dublin ones – lost their powers over waste collection and disposal, following their failure to ratify plans for waste disposal facilities, or any form of waste charging. As a result this power was transferred to council management, hugely unpopular bin charges were introduced, and the Poolbeg incinerator, which all parties opposed, was built.More recently, the failure to agree a route for the Liffey cycle path, which had been six years in the planning, resulted in the scheme being removed from the control of Dublin City Council and handed over to the National Transport Authority.In this case it wasn’t just the councillors (who couldn’t agree traffic ersions past their constituents’ houses) who were to blame, but also council officials, who produced endless iterations of the scheme, one of which saw double-decker buses rerouted through an existing apartment block.The most recent, and one of the most damning failures or officialdom to get to grips with decision making, is the College Green plaza refusal farce. The council tip-toed around the issue for a decade, tinkering with selective traffic restrictions, musing over fountains and statuary, but never really grasping the problem, which required getting buy-in from Dublin Bus before the project went to An Bord Pleanála for approval – a step which itself should have been taken years before.Surely there’s a better way of getting things done in the city. Could this dithering, bottling, buck-passing and procrastination be solved by Dublin having a directly elected mayor?“The central power, the most important point, of having a directly elected mayor, is that they have a ‘bully pulpit’,” Dr Deiric Ó Broin, DIT academic and co-author of the upcoming book Mayoral Governance in Dublin, argues.“The elected role gives them the authority to argue for more investment in the city, for keeping a more appropriate share of the money generated in Dublin. And they have to deliver their job is on the line. If they don’t deliver they may not be re-elected. That concentrates minds.”However, the concept of a mayor is one thing, the reality of the role and its functions is quite another, Ó Broin says.“The big issue is what powers the mayor would have and where would they come from. There is no point if the mayor is just a lord mayor, as in they have significant ceremonial but minor functional role, but who lasts for a five-year term.”Dublin city chief executive Owen Keegan agrees. “If it is to be successful the directly elected mayor has to have real powers, but he or she can only have real powers where the powers are taken from somewhere else. This notion that there’s some unallocated power that you can give to the mayor has no basis in reality – all power is already allocated.”And there isn’t much power within the hands of the council to give to a new mayor, Keegan says. “Since local government is weak here, the power and functions would have to come from central government, and that is a real issue because if there’s a directly elected mayor who is responsible for energy, and communications and transport in Dublin it doesn’t leave very much for the central Government to do.”Another vexing issue is what physical area would be governed by the mayor. “Culturally and politically we are obsessed with counties and county boundaries. I could see an argument for a city-only directly elected mayor and that gets away from that problem, but I don’t see how a city-based mayor could have responsibility for transport in Dublin, which crosses local authority boundaries,” Ó Broin says.This issue of boundaries played a large part in the collapse of the last mayoral plan. In 2013, then minister for the environment Phil Hogan decided, despite there being no legal requirement, that the councillors in all four Dublin local authorities would have to be in favour before Dubliners would get a chance to vote in a plebiscite on whether or not to have a mayor.The following year Dublin City, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, and South Dublin voted overwhelmingly in favour of the proposal but it was vetoed by Fingal, whose councillors felt they would be the poor country cousins, largely ignored by a city-focused mayor who would only be after their airport.As Gerry McGuire, a Labour councillor at the time, said there would be “no chance of getting a pothole fixed in rural Fingal”.Hogan showing great fortitude in keeping a straight face said he was “disappointed” as he was “the greatest proponent of devolution probably in the history of the State”.Last year the Government revived the mayoral proposal, making provision for a plebiscite this year, but it has recently kicked the can down the road, and kicked it out of the capital, determining that regional cities would vote at next year’s local elections on whether to have a mayor, but in Dublin it would first be referred to a citizens’ assembly for the capital.It seems like another unnecessary hurdle given that a similar forum spent five months formulating proposals for the mayor’s role in 2013, and, at that time surveys showed public support for a Dublin mayor was up to 80 per cent.Even if Dublin does get a mayor, what the Government appears to be proposing is a toothless role, either a mayor with the same powers as the current lord mayor, except elected, or an “executive mayor” who would take on some of the functions of the council chief executive.A plebiscite to decide whether there should be a mayor is unnecessary, Lacey says. “If the Government is serious about making progress let them legislate for it now. There is no need for a plebiscite. Successive governments never sought permission as they systematically dismantled local government in the past, so let them just repair it.”However, Lacey does not believe it’s necessary that the mayor would be all-powerful from the outset. “Calling for the full range of powers to be set out in advance is misguided. This is a position and a role that needs to be established and then given space to evolve.”But he says he can see particular areas where a mayor could make achievements straight away which might seem minor, but would be significant.“A mayor could initially have responsibility for natural resources. For example there isn’t much point in Dublin City Council cleaning the river Dodder in Donnybrook, if it’s not being cleaned first in Tallaght. Or sports capital grants – it makes no sense for a civil servant sitting in an office in Kerry to decide what local sports organisation in Dublin gets a grant.”Then, he suggests, other powers could be added such as waste and traffic policy, which should be “brought back under control of the council anyway”, he said.Ó Broin cites the system in Copenhagen as one where the mayor having control of these services works well. “The mayor has responsibility for education, welfare, labour services, welfare, climate change and a range of municipal services – Denmark, and Scandinavian countries in general, have very good, empowered local government.”Further afield, Boston and Toronto are recognised as good examples of mayor-led cities, he says. While our nearest neighbours have had some successful mayors, in some British cities, including Stoke-on-Trent, they have scrapped the office.The London model, Lacey believes, is not the system that should be copied in Dublin. “I don’t think the London model is a good one, with an all powerful mayor and a fairly toothless assembly. I’d like to a see a mayor working in partnership with a much smaller council – 24 or even 18 councillors. We should reduce the four councils to a manageable size, and give them more responsibility.”Keegan thinks the London model has worked well, particularly in relation to the mayor’s transport and policing supervisory functions, but he is with Lacey on the reducing in numbers of councillors from the current 63 in the city.“I am impressed by cities that have a small number of full-time councillors. In many cases they have executive functions. I think these councils, with a large number of councillors, make everything very difficult. Dublin City Council is too large. We are twinned with San Jose, where there’s a mayor, and I think they have eight or nine council members.”Keegan, however, remains unconvinced of the merits of having a mayor in Dublin. “I am a little bit concerned that the next ‘big idea’ is the directly elected mayor, and we’ll all lorry into that with great enthusiasm, but I have seen very little convincing analysis as to why this is such a good idea.“It’s been presented as a panacea to everything that’s wrong in Dublin, that will automatically be made right the day after we have a directly elected mayor.”Dublin doesn’t get credit for its success he says. “I don’t accept the notion that Dublin is a basket case. On many parameters Dublin is a very successful city. A good litmus test is the multinationals. They come here because they can attract people to live here. Of course it has problems with transport, and housing but these are problems of success. There was no housing affordability problem when we were in the depths of recession.”The “mad rush” towards the directly elected mayor idea reminds him of the “mad rush” to set up Irish Water. “Water supply was and is a major challenge but there was a notion that if you set up a separate utility everything would be hunky dory, but its implementation left a lot to be desired.”If the implementation of the mayor is poor, Dublin could find itself losing more than it gains, Keegan says.“There are strong arguments for a directly elected mayor, and I’m not saying there isn’t scope for improvement in the city’s governance, but there is a danger if we rush into this it won’t achieve any of its objectives, we’ll lose the things that work, and we’ll be worse off.”Each of the proposals in this Capital Ideas series has been put to a group of three experts for an initial “back of an envelope” evaluation. They are: Frances Ruane, former director of the Economic and Social Research Institute Caroline Spillane, director general of Engineers Ireland and Cliff Taylor, economics columnist with The .Caroline Spillane I have reservations about this plan, particularly due to the size of Dublin relative to the country as a whole. One person would have responsibility for 40 per cent of our population. The powers of this office would need to be carefully defined.The proposed mayor would be in a position of power for only five years, which could lead to short-term thinking.Cliff Taylor This proposal has surfaced in various forms over the years and fits into a common theme that restructuring institutions or posts can fix problems. This could be a good idea, but the job spec, powers and budget are key. The benefit depends on how it is structured – and who is elected, of course.It is a useful proposal but to work it requires a new vision for local government, something talked about for years and years but never delivered.Frances Ruane Cities with elected mayors seem to work well. However, in Ireland, this would have to be set up as part of a rebalancing of central and local government, if it is to work. If the city itself does not have decision-making power, then adding a mayor will not solve the problem.Meanwhile, Dublin City Council should work on its governance and adopt an integrated problem-solving planning approach. This must involve all four authorities working together. That would involve no serious resource costs.How can we improve Dublin city\u0026rsquos infrastructure, services and daily life?

Savour that moment because this may well be the very last time this particular ritual will ever happen.If all goes according to a plan laid out by the European Commission, the last-ever mandatory clock change in the European Union will take place in 2019. Member states must notify the commission by April of next year on whether they want to opt for permanent summer or permanent winter time. Whether all 27 states are prepared to go along, however, is not yet clear.This weekend, the Department of Justice (which has responsibility for everything to do with timekeeping) is announcing plans for its public consultation here on the proposal.A recent European Commission online public consultation across the EU found 84 per cent of citizens were in favour of ending the changing of clocks in spring and autumn.The commission trumpeted the fact that it had got 4.6 million responses, the highest number ever received in an exercise of this sort, and that 84 per cent of those backed the change to a single year-round time.Less loudly advertised was the fact that engagement varied significantly from country to country three million of those responses came from Germany, representing almost 4 per cent of that country’s population. In contrast, less than 0.25 per cent of Irish people bothered to respond.The question now is whether inidual member states will agree to proceed along the lines advocated by the commission, which has stated a preference for summer time to be applied universally. There is potential for chaos, with a patchwork of time zones emerging across continental Europe.Initial polling, for example, suggests people in the Netherlands and Denmark would prefer permanent winter time, while Germans want summer time.“We are not proposing that the whole EU either switches to summer or winter time,” said transport commissioner Violeta Bulc at a press conference last month. “All we are proposing is that we do it together.”But clock-switching on the Dutch-German border is hardly the desired outcome.An intriguing twist from the Irish perspective is whether the UK, at a moment of heightened political tension, will view this as a symbolic opportunity to flaunt its newly acquired independence.Brexiteers’ enthusiasm for such a stance may be dimmed when they realise it would mean Britain sharing a time zone with Brussels and Berlin for almost half the year.But understandably, media coverage here so far has focused on the prospect of travellers from Dundalk to Newry having to adjust their watches – or of people nipping across from Lifford to Strabane in search of an extra hour’s drinking time.For geographical and historical reasons, Ireland and the UK have been on the same clock since Dublin Time was abolished in the wake of the Rising in 1916.We moved in lockstep with the UK when it experimented with year-round summer time in the late 1960s, and any recent proposals for change, such as one mooted in a Private Members’ Bill rejected by then minister for justice Alan Shatter in 2013, have been contingent on decisions made at Westminster and, more recently, in Brussels.So what would the changes mean? If Ireland opts for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, then dawn won’t break in the west of Ireland until almost 10am in mid-December. However, if “winter time” is maintained throughout the year, sunrise in Dublin will occur well before 4am in June, and the stretch in the evenings will be a lot less grand, with sunset happening before 9pm even in midsummer.Those are the extremes, but where permanent summer time offers real gains is in the “shoulder months” of November, February and March, when the majority of people will have much more daylight at the end of their school or working day without too much negative impact in the mornings.There has been a broad attempt across the world in recent decades to do away with annual time-shifts, based on data about their negative health effects and on a more general sense that an additional hour of daylight in the evening is more valuable than one in the morning.Meanwhile, the main rationale for the current system – reduced electricity usage – has been rendered less important by the introduction in recent years of energy-efficient electric lighting. Lifestyles have also changed enormously since the current system’s introduction a century ago, and even since the last experimental change 50 years ago.Flexible working time, increased leisure opportunities and longer retail opening hours all have an effect on how we spend our day.The main impediment to change, it seems, is institutional. In the US, legislators in California and other states are also pushing for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, but they need to persuade the federal government before they can proceed. As in the EU, American legislation allows each state to decide its time zone but forbids inidual states from choosing when or if to change their seasonal clocks. Whether the gridlocked US political system can respond remains to be seen.Here, the Department of Justice’s public consultation asks three questions. Do you want to stop changing the clocks twice a year? If the clock changes stop, do you want to remain on summer time or winter time? Is staying on the same time as the UK more important than your choice of summertimewintertime?“It is very important that as many citizens as possible respond to this consultation and express their views so that the Government may take account of public opinion when considering this proposal by the EU,” says Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan, clearly implying that the Government will take account of public opinion without being bound by it.Ultimately the success or failure of the proposal may come to be seen as a test of the EU’s ability to act quickly and decisively on a simple issue which will have an almost immediate effect upon people’s lives. The process so far has been startlingly fast, but the national consultations may be a different matter, depending perhaps on the views of the people who get up early in the morning."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3686837.1541429523!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar defends harris after o brien calls him a frightened little boy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has defended the Minister for Health Simon Harris and said the HSE’s practice of passing its problems onto the Department of Health needs to change.  Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has defended the Minister for Health Simon Harris and said the HSE’s practice of passing its problems onto the Department of Health needs to change. Mr Varadkar was responding to an interview in The Sunday Business Post in which the former HSE chief Tony O’Brien described Mr Harris as behaving “like a frightened little boy” during the cervical screen controversy.“In relation to Minister Harris, all I’d say to people is look at that guy’s record. In the past six months alone, he brought through the referendum to repeal the eighth amendment and at long last has enacted the public health alcohol bill legislation that’s going to save a lot of lives. “That’s two pretty big achievements by a health minister in six months and I believe anything he may lack in terms of experience or age, he makes up in his commitment and his compassion,” Mr Varadkar told reporters on Monday. The Taoiseach said while Mr O’Brien was a “good” public servant, “let’s not forget the circumstances under which he decided to step down early”. “That was the HSE’s very bad handling of the cervical check controversy which he admits himself was a train wreck and he was CEO at the time,” he said. Mr Varadkar said Mr O’Brien was right to step down from his position last May, several weeks before his contract was scheduled to expire. The Taoiseach also said it “wasn’t good enough” for the HSE to pass its problems into the Department of Health. “Most agencies accept that it’s their responsibility to come in on budget for example, the HSE’s practice for many years now has been to sort of pass the problem on to the department and I think it’s something that has to change, it certainly has to change now that we’ve a record budget for health, an extra €1bn for health next year,” he said. “If the Department of Education, if CIE, if pretty much every government agency and government body can come in on budget, it isn’t too much to ask the HSE to do so and it’s not good enough they just write letters passing the problem on to the department, that’s just not what people are paid a lot of money to do.”Minister for Health Simon Harris said he would never apologise for holding people to account, asking health service officials the hard questions and demanding that people do better. He said he did not engage in the politics of personalised attacks. Speaking on Monday, Mr Harris said he appreciated the comments and support of Vicky Phelan -the Limerick woman whose court case brought the cervical screening controversy to light - in how she had found dealing with him as Minister. He said following the emergence of the cervical screening controversy it was “a very frightening time for women in this country”. “My priority was always making sure the needs of those women came first and I will never apologise for holding people to account, for asking officials the hard questions and demanding people do better. “I really have nothing further to add other than I am getting on with my job of trying to improve the health service. I am here in Limerick to announce an additional 60 beds and the opening of a new cataract theatre. That is what the people who elected us care about, not name calling,” he said. Cervical cancer campaigner Vicky Phelan defended the health minister on Twitter on Sunday and said her experience of Mr Harris has been “a man who, far from lacking courage, had to make some hard decisions which did not make him popular but he made them anyway because it was the right thing to do”Ms Phelan said Mr O’Brien, as head of the HSE, “presided over one of the worst health scandals ever to hit this country”. “I agree with Tony’s call for changes to the way we treat public servants. I am a public servant myself. I, however, want to see more scrutiny of public servants and real accountability in this country, not less,” she added.“Until we have real accountability of public servants in this country, enshrined by legislation, we will continue to see more health scandals, more tribunals of inquiry and more public servants who get it wrong.” Meanwhile, the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has rejected a description of the committee by Mr O’Brien as “a kangaroo court”.“I don’t accept the phraseology, but it can be robust,” Sean Fleming (FF) told RTE’s Morning Ireland. The committee held a number of hearings on the cervical cancer controversy. People who “have their homework done” and “have answers” when they come before the committee “get on well,” but people who have responsibility for budgets worth billions of euro and do not provide answers “that does cause problems,” Mr Fleming said. Mr Fleming accepted that some members of the PAC “can speak aggressively,” but all that can be avoided if the people who come before the committee provide answers when questioned.“It can all be avoided if they give information.”Referring to Mr O’Brien’s comment about the Cervical Check controversy as being “a train wreck,” Mr Fleming said he could understand public upset with “the person driving the train.”The PAC chairman said he believed that the public wants the committee to “keep the pressure on.”He said he would be far more concerned if people coming before the committee “felt it was a piece of cake.”Mr O’Brien had been more interested in politics than the health service in his “exit interview” with the Sunday Business Post, said Mr Fleming. “I would have been happier if it was more about the health service.”Mr Harris, has said some accusations leveled during Public Accounts Committee (PAC) hearings into the CervicalCheck scandal “crossed the line” and were not factual.Speaking Monday, in Nenagh, Co Tipperary, r Harris said: “I think it’s important that that forum (the PAC) is always respectful, and I think, being honest, there is times when it isn’t.”“I think some of the accusations that were leveled, at that committee, were not born out by fact, when Dr Scally looked at it.”He said officials in the public service “have to account” for their actions “by going before the democratically elected representatives of the people and answering questions.”The Minister said that in the immediate wake of the scandal “there was a genuine fear...about the well being and health of women” which the PAC “tried to respond to, by asking questions”.However, he said he felt some of the questioning of those - which may have included Mr O’Brien - “got very hot and heavy”.“I do think, at times, it crossed a line, in terms of some of the accusations that were levelled,” Mr Harris said.However, he added: “I think we need to be very very careful that we don’t dismiss the importance of democratic accountability and the importance of people answering tough questions. Certainly, I’ll never apologise for asking those who work with me, the difficult questions, that my bosses - the people of Ireland - expect me to ask.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3687287.1541447142!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"peter casey expresses shock at insulting treatment on late late show","story":"Presidential election runner-up Peter Casey has said he will run for a Dáil seat in Donegal, ideally as a Fianna Fáil candidate.

Photograph: ScreengrabRTÉ The runner-up in the recent presidential election, Peter Casey, has said he was “shocked” at his treatment during an interview on RTÉ’s The Late Late Show last Friday. Mr Casey had appeared to take issue with questioning during the broadcast from two members of the Travelling community who were in the studio audience. Mr Casey, a businessman born in Derry, went from obscurity in early opinion polls to runner-up in the election.The candidate rose to prominence during the campaign following controversial comments he made about Travellers, stating that they were “basically people camping in someone else’s land” who were not paying their “fair share” of taxes. Mr Casey doubled down on his remarks during his interview on RTÉ’s The Late Late Show, when he said the community should “absolutely not” be recognised as an ethnic minority. Last year the Travelling community was officially recognised as an ethnic minority. Mr Casey was then challenged by two audience members from the Travelling community over his views during the interview. Mr Casey asked host Ryan Tubridy if the presenter had “lost control” of the discussion. In response, Mr Tubridy said: “I have absolutely not Peter, and if I do you’ll know about it.”A spokeswoman for RTÉ said the national broadcaster had no comment to make on Mr Casey’s statements.President Michael D Higgins was re-elected for a second term in the election on October 26th, winning 56 per cent of the vote, the largest number of votes ever for a candidate in a presidential election. Mr Casey secured 23 per cent of the vote, with Seán Gallagher a distant third on just in excess of 6 per cent.

What has happened to this country? Can he be stopped? When will it end? How the hell did we get here?At sunset in the red mountains outside Denver, a tall man with white hair, granite features, black jeans and black Lucchese cowboy boots thinks he knows that last answer.While the rest of us obsess on what happened in 2016 and what will happen on Tuesday, Gary Hart is bedevilled by what happened in 1987, and whether the tabloid mania sparked by his liaison with Donna Rice led down a rattlesnake-filled path straight to our tabloid president.Hart, and a new Jason Reitman movie about the Rice imbroglio, The Front Runner, both pose the question: is there a direct connection between Hart’s fall and Trump’s rise?If reporters had not hidden in the bushes, would there have been any Bushes?If Hart had won in 1988, would Dick Cheney have finished his career with a golden parachute at Halliburton instead of a dark plunge into deranged global domination? Would we have been spared from two wars against Saddam, September 11th, Islamic State and the climate catastrophe?“I bear a very heavy burden of responsibility,” Hart says, picking at a “game plate” of elk, buffalo and quail at the Fort restaurant outside of Denver. “If all that stuff had not happened and if I had been elected, there would have been no gulf war. HW wouldn’t have been president. W wouldn’t have been president. Everything would have changed. I don’t say that to aggrandise myself. It’s just, history changed.“And that has haunted me for 30 years. I had only one talent and it wasn’t traditional politics – I could see farther ahead than anybody.”You could dismiss this as “sans moi, le deluge” grandiosity. But, whatever his flaws, the former senator from Colorado was a political Nostradamus. He foresaw the rise of Silicon Valley and the demise of Detroit. Known as “an Atari Democrat,” he lunched in LA with Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in 1983.As early as the 1970s, he recalled, “a few of us were forecasting that globalisation and the shift of the economic base from Detroit to Silicon Valley was going to have huge impact on our country sociologically and politically”.He oversaw a bipartisan panel on threats facing the nation that delivered its final report on January 31st, 2001. “The first finding was America will be attacked by terrorists using weapons of mass destruction and Americans will die on American soil, possibly in large numbers,” he said. “We saw Colin Powell. We saw Rumsfeld. We saw Condi Rice.” He said he warned Rice at the White House again on September 6th, 2001. “Guess who didn’t listen? George W Bush and Dick Cheney. Always keep one thing in mind: 911 could have been prevented.”Hart is 81 now, which is a jolt when you see him, because he hasn’t been in the public eye much in the decades since that totemic image of Rice smiling on his lap on a pier in Bimini, while he was wearing a Monkey Business crew T-shirt. He rejected the skeezy redemption offered by the scandal food chain. In his 2010 memoir, the only Rice in the index is Condoleezza.Before Hart, we had FDR, LBJ and JFK, who did not suffer politically for dalliances because the mostly male press corps had a bro-code and a blind eye.After Hart, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump got through frenzies about sexual transgressions by enduring the ridicule, enlisting their wives to defend them on TV, and attacking their accusers.But the scratchy Hart wasn’t made that way. The adultery story enhanced the sense that he was an enigma, a story line that developed when the press learned that he had changed his name from Hartpence and fudged his age by a year.Hart ruefully recalled reporters having “a cool and aloof key” on their Radio Shack TRS-80 word processors. When Hugh Jackman, who plays the candidate in the movie, gave interviews calling Hart enigmatic, Hart said to his son, John: “I’m not enigmatic, am I?” “Yep, you are,” John replied.Hart haughtily withdrew from the race with a Jeffersonian echo: “I tremble for my country when I think we may, in fact, get the kind of leaders we deserve.” The Front Runner, featuring Vera Farmiga as the traumatised Lee Hart, uses that speech to imply that the leader we deserve, for being so squeamish about Hart, is Trump.Hart maintained that “there was no relationship” with Rice. Rice – who became an evangelical and supports Trump – told People this week: “I’m just not discussing it.” But a married candidate can’t have a gorgeous young model fly up to DC from Miami for the weekend to visit his house – “the infamous townhouse,” as Hart’s son dryly calls it – and not attract questions if they are seen.A recent piece by James Fallows in the Atlantic reported that Lee Atwater, the Republican dirty trickster and Poppy Bush party chief, confessed before his death that he had set up Hart for his weekend of doom on Monkey Business.“That’s the only way that 48-hour period makes any sense,” Hart told me.Even if it was casual recreation, the optics were bad and he – and his campaign – should have known it. Especially if the stakes for the world were as high as he says.Shamelessness is now a superpower, as the twitterati say, and the audacious are rewarded. I wondered if Hart wished he had fought back.“I’m not Donald Trump and I didn’t behave like Donald Trump,” he replied firmly. But he does refer to his hell week as “the witch hunt. I blame myself,” he said. He says he doesn’t blame the press, but I don’t believe him.“I am still disturbed more by what happened after the original story – the condemnation in op-eds, in editorials, in opinion pages, by people who knew who I was but who just came down on me like a ton of bricks and wrote awful, vile things about me. The key word was character. ‘We had to do this because our job is to protect the American people from bad characters.’ It was all self-justification. There’s nothing wrong with my character.”Hart said that, after the Rice story broke, Ben Bradlee had a Washington Post reporter give Hart a list of supposed inamoratas, warning that there would be a story unless Hart withdrew.(Seven months later, he got back in the race and I covered him. But it was a forlorn campaign he carried his own luggage – and Lee’s.)“A list of names!” Hart said, the 30-year-old outrage fresh in his voice. “I mean, everybody knew Ben Bradlee and Jack Kennedy chased girls.”“I didn’t hold myself out to be –” he said, trailing off. “Look, Lee and I were separated several times and I stayed at Bob Woodward’s house. Yes, I’m a famous Washington philanderer and when my wife and I separate, where do I go to do my philandering? Bob Woodward’s house? Gimme a break!”(Back in 1987, the Washington Post did a story saying that Woodward and Hart aides were “disturbed that Hart had implied to reporters and others that he was staying at Woodward’s when more often he was staying with another woman”.)In 1998, in the midst of the Clinton-Lewinsky uproar, Hart told me that he thought America might be getting more European about pols and sex, “growing up, finding out there is not a Santa Claus.”I am not sure that’s true. We have not reached any consensus on the issue, except that most strategists know better than to publicly trash the women at the centre of such scandals.In the Clinton years, some journalists wrote that we should separate “public character” from “private character” and acknowledge, as with the Founding Fathers, you could be a good leader even if your private life was questionable.But last year, in the midst of the #Metoo reckoning, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand criticised Al Franken after he was accused of groping and faux-groping for a joke picture, and told the New York Times that Bill Clinton should have resigned over the Lewinsky matter.The standards remain subjective, inconsistently applied and partisan.Matt Bai, the Yahoo columnist who helped write the new Hart movie based on his book All the Truth is Out, posits that Hart’s exile “cost us something” as a nation.But Bai thinks that each case must be “measured in some context,” and that the press should not abdicate its responsibility to judge. He thinks it was “damn relevant” for reporters from the National Enquirer to skulk around the Beverly Hilton and reveal that John Edwards had fathered a child with his mistress, while forcing an aide to say it was his.Although Hart would like the media to have a serious discussion about what is and is not permitted, the culture has flown past that.Nowadays, it wouldn’t be reporters in the bushes next to Hart’s Capitol Hill townhouse snapping pictures as the couple emerged, but passers-by on cellphones.“There has been an explosion in social media that creates a minute-to-minute voracious appetite for things that will attract people’s attention,” David Axelrod told me. “And the explosion of money in politics weaponises negative stories.”If Hart didn’t get to be president, he’s still prescient. I didn’t want to leave without asking what he thinks the next great threat will be.“Cyber,” he shot back. “Could be banks. Could be transportation systems. Could be communications systems. It’s going to happen. If you want to find a secure place up here and take it off the grid, I can help you do that.” – New York Times service"},{"url":null,"title":"halloween celebrations costumes around world pictures","story":"Around 2000 people gathered on the streets of Kawasaki, Japan, to watch the country\u0027s largest Halloween parade on Saturday 28th October.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Both these options will further depress investment. They will be bad for business and bad for working people.“Given that neither was on the ballot in 2016, we believe the ultimate choice should be handed back to the public with a People\u0027s Vote.”Lord Myners, who was appointed as city minister by Gordon Brown in 2008 but now sits as a crossbencher, said: “Any deal will be made from a position of weakness where we have surrendered our principal negotiating cards.“It will be half-formed, casting a long shadow over business confidence, damaging investment and hurting both enterprises and their employees for years to come.”A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said: “The people of the United Kingdom have already had their say in one of the biggest democratic exercises this country has ever seen and the Prime Minister has made it clear that there is not going to be a second referendum.“We remain confident we will agree a mutually advantageous deal with the EU, that works for business and the economy.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sometimes you just have to get yourself expelled from school. Cleo Rocos, chief executive of tequila company AquaRiva, went (briefly) to a convent school. She didn’t take to the nuns because they had a habit of smacking her over the knuckles with a ruler. One sister had a pronounced moustache. So naturally the young Cleo, aged 11, bought her a pack of\u0026nbsprazors for Christmas. An inspired and kindly thought which probably had the\u0026nbspdesired effect of getting her booted out of the convent. She has never looked back. Ever since she sailed to our shores from Rio, aged 6, and discovered to her shock and horror that the sea was grey (she had never seen grey water before) – chilly too – she has taken it as her life’s mission to inject more colour and warmth into the world. “Tequila,” she tells me, “makes everything seem more wonderful.”Sitting in Cafe\u0026nbspPacifico in Covent Garden on a Friday afternoon sipping margaritas with her, I’m inclined to agree. Note the sipping. “You should only sip tequila,” she says, “unless you’re having something removed without an anaesthetic.” The tradition of throwing it down your throat – possibly with some ancient worm lurking at the bottom of the bottle (which is unfair to worms too) – is “strictly for cowboys”. Cleo Rocos doesn’t just make a very pure and clean-tasting tequila, she is a flame-haired evangelist, a passionate believer. She has even written a book on the subject, one that I doubt her old convent teachers will be putting in the school library: The Power of Positive Drinking. How to drink tequila and actually enjoy itThe surprising health benefits of tequilaFive of the best cocktails for National Tequila DayDrinking tequila is good for your bones, science saysShe was recently stuck on a Tube train in a tunnel on the Central Line, somewhere between Tottenham Court Road and Bank. An announcement came over the PA: “Please stay calm. We should be moving in about 20 minutes.” Cue general gloom and consternation. Then Rocos stood up and made her own personal announcement: “I have two bottles of tequila with me and 20 glasses – anyone care to join me?” The train was magically transformed into a party venue. “Everyone was jolly by the end,” she says. Rocos must like Tube trains: she discovered the young art student who designed her label (a couple dancing on the wing of a plane) on the politan Line.Tequila is now the fastest-growing category among spirits in the world. I think I have just become a convert too. To AquaRiva anyway. What is surprising is that Rocos ever became so keen on tequila herself. She started off with a bad experience during school, post-convent. “It’s like you’re on a bobsleigh to hell. For years I hated tequila,” she says. Tequila in those days was often only 51 per cent agave with a load of raw alcohol and additive on top. “That’s the reason why people try to swallow it without tasting. It was the only way.” She started to swing around to liking tequila\u0026nbspin the late 1980s. Back then Rocos appeared in the Kenny Everett Video Show. After filming, she and Kenny would frequently slope off and have a predominantly liquid lunch, then take a taxi to Heathrow and jump on the first plane to wherever, without a suitcase or even a toothbrush, just for the craic. She came to the conclusion that “wonderful things happen after you’ve had a few drinks”.In her acting career she has inhabited roles ranging from “exotic dancer” to producer, but she defines herself as a comedian. “The last thing I’d want is to get run over without having had a good laugh, or without my lipstick or earrings – I expect to get run over in a moment of mindless glee.” Some years ago she hosted her own TV show for Channel 5, Cleo Worldwide, in which she took “lovely people to lovely locations and we had\u0026nbspcocktails together”.But the real turning point occurred some 16 years ago when she came across a woman in Mexico who “looked like the editor of Mexican Vogue. An older woman but sensational”. She was drinking tequila from a long\u0026nbspfluted glass. “That was when I fell in love. To think I’d spent all those years at the BBC drinking warm white wine, which might just as well have been used to suck the stains out of carpet tiles. And it gave you a headache.”She made her mind up to go into the tequila business. Wise men tried to put her off. Don’t even think about it, they said. It takes eight years for the agave plant to become viable, you need huge investment, etc. But she ploughed on regardless. “If you listened to other people, you’d never do anything. I knew nothing but I learned everything I could about tequila.” She also wants\u0026nbspto give a shout-out to HSBC. “I know banks come in for a lot of flak, but they were with me every step of the way and I couldn’t have done it without them. I didn’t have a lot of money behind me to begin with.” The name “tequila” is owned by the Mexican government. It can only be produced in\u0026nbspselect areas of Mexico. Rocos spent 11 months up in the highlands experimenting and concocting and fine-tuning, communing with a blender guru, and finally creating her own brand. The key is to use only 100 per cent pure organic agave syrup and volcanic spring water, and allow the brew to “rest” – hence “reposado” – in old bourbon barrels for a few months. She still likes to go to Arandas, east of Guadalajara, and get up early in the morning to go up to the agave fields, walk across the deep red earth and join in the harvesting.Tequila makes us into our favourite versions of ourselves – like edited highlightsAquaRiva recently won the “Best of the Best” blind-tasting competition in America. It’s won so many gold medals over the last few years that Rocos says she can’t pin them all on the bottle, otherwise “it would look like some mad dictator”. Her brand is now the “house pour” at TGI Fridays and can be found in many restaurants. The AquaRiva brand of agave syrup is sold in Waitrose and Sainsbury’s. India is likewise opening up to AquaRiva. Bollywood has embraced tequila. The next frontier is the United States. \u0026nbspAquaRiva is sugar free, low on calories and “good for dieting”, Rocos assures me. She is her own living, breathing advertisement for the power\u0026nbspof tequila. When she stands up to go and find another bottle, she doesn’t walk, she dances. “Tequila makes us into our favourite versions of ourselves – like edited highlights.” She is critical of a lot of bad wine, full of additives. “You wake up feeling like you’ve been floating in a chlorinated swimming pool, face down, all night.” Rocos hates to see people bingeing and getting paralytic. On the other hand, she is very much in favour of dancing on tables, or, for that matter, on plane wings. Her slogan is: “Drink wisely, drink AquaRiva.” Of course, the president of the Tequila Society would say that. But there is a funny line of hers that sticks with me and which echoes my own brief, slightly inebriated, totally unreliable experience in Cafe\u0026nbspPacifico. “It should taste like you’re drinking the first day of your holidays – you open the door and you want to run into the sea.”\u0026nbspAs I walk\u0026nbspdown Langley Street and on to Long Acre, I can swear the blue sky looks\u0026nbspsomehow bluer than before, and the sun\u0026nbspjust a little bit sunnier.A View from the TopShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We’ve hiked wages by up to 30 per cent in just four years! Aren’t we great?That\u0027s what the chain\u0027s press release said. OK, I added the last part, but you get my drift. It is indeed welcome news. But there is a caveat. By contrast to, say, cosmetics outfit Lush, furniture retailer Ikea, luxury goods emporium Burberry, and a number of smaller outfits, Lidl is not among the sadly very limited number of retailers that are accredited Living Wage employers. More than 6 million UK jobs ‘pay less than real living wage’Minimum wage failing to give families a basic \u0027no frills\u0027 lifestyleThe majority of companies still refuse to pay the real living wageTo secure that status you have to ensure that outsourced workers, who perform functions that in an earlier age would have been performed by employees, enjoy the same benefits. Given the dizzying number of functions businesses employ other businesses to handle for them, that matters. You can hardly call yourself a living wage employer if you go out and sub contract with people to provide cleaners, or temps, or security guards, or trolley collectors, who pay poverty wages. The aforementioned retailers have proved that you can still turn a nice profit while being accredited living wage employers. So have Aviva, Barclays, Nestle, Nationwide, KPMG, all of which (I imagine) engage in some level of outsourcing. So it shouldn\u0027t be impossible for Lidl to do the same. Tess Lanning, director of the Living Wage Foundation, says the campaign exists “to tackle the rising problem of people paid less than what they need to makes ends meet”. That problem is a big one in Britain. Too big. She adds: “To do this we ask real Living Wage employers to ensure all staff, including their sub-contracted staff, are earning a wage they can really live on. In many supermarkets this means valuing the outsourced cleaners, security guards and trolley collectors as an integral part of the workforce alongside the cashiers and store managers.”As a former trolley collector myself, albeit before anyone had thought to outsource that function, I heartily endorse that sentiment. The Foundation says it would be more than happy to work with Lidl so it could become the first accredited living wage supermarket in Britain. I urge the company to take up the opportunity to do so so that next year I will be able to give the announcement it puts out at this time every year an unqualified endorsement.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The people in them\u0026nbspdon’t really make enough to live on and that\u0027s\u0026nbspchilling\u0026nbspif you think about it.\u0026nbspIt might help to explain why food banks are doing such brisk business.\u0026nbspAt this point those on the right will wag their fingers and say that while paying the Living Wage might be affordable to the likes of Barclays, KPMG, Heathrow Airport, and some of their peers, that’s not true of all business, and particularly small businesses.\u0026nbsp“It\u0027s a\u0026nbspjob killer,” will be the cry.\u0026nbspThe evidence says otherwise. Firms who have signed up to the scheme report economic benefits including improved staff retention (important at a time when Britain is suffering labour shortages in some areas) better quality work, lower rates of absenteeism.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s a superb\u0026nbspidea, and better still,\u0026nbspit pays for itself, which ought to be enough in itself to get a sane and sensible government to take note. But I’ve raised these arguments in the past.\u0026nbspMore is apparently necessary to get through to the thick and empty heads around the cabinet table and the and benches where sit the members of this country’s governing Tory Party.\u0026nbspSo how about this: Consider how many policies would be enhanced if the ‘National Living Wage’ was closer to, or even matched, the real Living Wage.\u0026nbspTheresa May might finally\u0026nbspbe able to talk about a country that works for everyone with a degree of honesty if that country provided its low waged workers with enough to live on.\u0026nbspThere would be less need for the state to subsidise poorly paid work, and perhaps less pain caused to the Government via its Universal Credit, a policy that is turning into this generation of Tories’ poll tax.\u0026nbspThe Living Wage movement has put over £800m million back into the pockets of more than 180,000 low paid workers, £200m this year alone, most of which has gone back into the economy because those on lower incomes spend a high proportion of what they earn.Think, for a moment, about the potential economic impact were the number of workers on the real Living Wage to be doubled. Or trebled.\u0026nbspThe boost that this would provide would be most obviously be felt in the northern parts of these islands, where wages are generally lower. If ministers want to make their ‘Northern Powerhouse’ a reality, giving low earners a pay rise would be a damn good start.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The number of jobs paying below the threshold has actually increased by 1.2 million since 2012, which really hammers home the magnitude of in-work poverty in the UK. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp“Clearly such a sizeable challenge requires a collective societal effort. For businesses, it’s critical to look beyond the bottom line, instead of focusing on non-monetary aspects like improved staff morale, rising service standards or increased productivity.” \u0026nbspLWF director Tess Lanning said:  “The living wage campaign is about tackling the rising problem of people paid less than they need to live. “Responsible businesses know that the government minimum is not enough to live on, and today’s new living wage rates will provide a boost for hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the UK.” \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspShe added: “Employers that pay the real living wage enable their workers to live a life of dignity, supporting them to pay off debts and meet the pressures of rising bills. We want to see local councils, universities, football clubs, bus companies and the other major public and private sector employers in every city commit to become real living wage employers. “When they do, thousands of people get a pay rise, but other local employers also follow their lead.

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused.

Created by David Angell, Peter Casey, and David Lee, the comedy was widely celebrated during its eleven seasons, winning 37 Emmys. The sitcom ended with the eponymous character leaving Seattle for Chicago.Doctor Frasier\u0026nbspCrane, played by Grammer, first appeared in beloved Boston-set sitcom Cheers which ran on NBC from 1982 to 1993. The actor has gone on to enjoy\u0026nbspbig-screen success, starring in Hollywood sequels such as X-Men: The Last Stand, The Expendables 3 and Transformers: Age of Extinction.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The move has been driven largely by higher transport costs, private rents and council tax.Workers in London will see a rise of\u0026nbsp35p\u0026nbspto £10.55 per hour for their real living wage. The LWF\u0026nbsprates\u0026nbspare\u0026nbspadopted voluntarily by businesses, while the government\u0027s living wage is £7.83.Research from KPMG has revealed that one in five jobs still pay less than the real living wage –\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspthe number failing to meet the threshold is growing.

The number of jobs paying below the threshold has actually increased by 1.2 million since 2012, which really hammers home the magnitude of in-work poverty in the UK. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp“Clearly such a sizeable challenge requires a collective societal effort. For businesses, it’s critical to look beyond the bottom line, instead of focusing on non-monetary aspects like improved staff morale, rising service standards or increased productivity.” \u0026nbspLWF director Tess Lanning said:  “The living wage campaign is about tackling the rising problem of people paid less than they need to live. “Responsible businesses know that the government minimum is not enough to live on, and today’s new living wage rates will provide a boost for hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the UK.” \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspShe added: “Employers that pay the real living wage enable their workers to live a life of dignity, supporting them to pay off debts and meet the pressures of rising bills. We want to see local councils, universities, football clubs, bus companies and the other major public and private sector employers in every city commit to become real living wage employers. “When they do, thousands of people get a pay rise, but other local employers also follow their lead.

Sean O’Grady prepares for the worstClick to followThe IndependentWith the best will in the world, and there may be a remarkable shortage of that in the coming months, a chaotic Brexit will make reliable delivery of a huge variety of items more trickyIn the\u0026nbsptwo and a bit years\u0026nbspsince the EU referendum, successive waves of optimism and pessimism have crashed across the nation as hopes for an acceptable outcome\u0026nbsprise and fall. We still don’t know what will be decided at upcoming “crunch” European Union summits –\u0026nbspand the possibility remains that, even if a healthy dose of\u0026nbspgoodwill enables some kind of agreement to be cobbled together, Brexit will be messy.Whatever else, undoing a half-century of integration is bound to cause some distortion. So to be prudent, you might want to “Brexit-proof” your life, just in case. Here is my\u0026nbspfar from exhaustive\u0026nbspguide to some of the things you might (or might not) want to consider as departure day approaches.1. Stock up on loo rollWhat could be more essential to civilised life? Right now your local supermarket will happily sell you as many multipacks of Andrex (other leading brands are available) as you can transport home – but after 29 March\u0026nbsp2019\u0026nbspthere is a risk\u0026nbspthey may need to ration the supply. You see, some 50 per cent of the wood pulp used to make toilet rolls in UK factories comes into the country on lorries from Sweden,\u0026nbspan EU member state. When the lorries get stuck on some ferry somewhere, the factories will soon run out of raw material. They could make up the shortfall with the wood pulp that comes in from Brazil, although apparently that stuff isn’t as comfortable to use. You have been warned.Raab: Those fearing Brexit hit to car industry should show ‘mettle’2. Order your new car nowAround 85 per cent of the UK’s new car market is accounted for by imports,\u0026nbspand there are few vehicles you can buy that don’t have at least some European Union\u0026nbspcontent – including some famous British brands. The Mini, for example, has a crankshaft that crosses the Chanel more than a dozen times as it reaches completion. The Jaguar E-Pace, an excellent sporting SUV, is made in Austria, while only the Astra from the Vauxhall range is made here –\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspagain, it\u0026nbspcontains EU parts. On the other hand, all of BMW’s four-cylinder engines for the likes of the 3 Series are made in Birmingham…Disruption to such automotive supply chains will make delays inevitable for virtually any brand.\u0026nbspTariffs on new car imports, if imposed by the UK, may add to the list price – if you can source the vehicle in the first place. Order now from stock and relax.By the by, if you own a Fiat, Kia, Volkswagen, Nissan, Toyota, Skoda, Seat, Renault, Peugeot, Citroen, Vauxhall, Ford or virtually any other brand with parts from the EU, which includes “British” brands such as Mini, Bentley and Jaguar, then you might also want to buy a few spares. Just in case.3. Apply for an international driving permitThis is fairly crucial if you want to be able to drive legally “over there”.If you are fond of a proper brie, to offer a further random example, you know what to do...One of the main benefits of EU membership we take for granted is the Europe-wide recognition of national driving licences. This could conceivably end if we “crash\u0026nbspout” of the club. An international driving permit will allow you to drive legally throughout\u0026nbspthe EU you’ll need to\u0026nbspapply\u0026nbspfor it personally at a post office, for a reasonable fee of £5.50.4. Lay down some French wines, German salami, Italian pasta, Polish vodka, Belgian chocolates, Spanish manchego, Greek olives…With the best will in the world, and there may be a remarkable shortage of that in the coming months, a chaotic Brexit will make reliable delivery of these sorts of treats more tricky. There are British alternatives to many of them\u0026nbspbut\u0026nbspnot all, obviously. The commercial British olive, for example, is yet to make its appearance. If you are fond of a proper brie, to offer a further random example, you know what to do (no offence Somerset). You can\u0026nbspfreeze\u0026nbspharder cheeses and stick\u0026nbspsome pickled or “brined” cheeses in the pantry. The delicatessen then – such a continental word – is your next shopping destination. You’ll at least enjoy it, but try not to eat it all at once. Get stockpiling.5. Make sure your health insurance covers trips to the EU or EEAThe European Health Card and smooth reciprocal arrangements across the EU for member\u0026nbspcitizens in need of care could disappear. The safest solution might be to apply for some health insurance\u0026nbspthat will cover you in the EU for holidays and business trips.6. Review your investmentsNever a bad idea in any case. If you’re lucky enough to own some, including a (money purchase) pension pot, then be ready for the volatility a chaotic Brexit will bring. Currency movements will probably mean dollar, euro and other foreign currency assets will rise in value you may also find changes in the tax treatment of your stocks, shares, bond and real estate as the UK and EU settle down to their new, less convergent relationship.Fears of a collapse in sterling may be exaggerated but it is something you need to be aware ofWithout going full Project Fear II, there may also be sharpish trends in inflation, interest rates and tax that you might not have foreseen. A change in the Bank of England bank rate, for example, will influence gilt and, thus, annuity rates for people who purchase one with their retirement pot (though of course\u0026nbspyou don’t\u0026nbsphave to go down the annuity route under the newish “pension\u0026nbspfreedoms”). This could be favourable, or not, depending on what happens, but you need to understand what might happen, so far as you can. As ever, do your own research and seek independent financial advice.7. What, the gîte has to go?The timeshare pad in Spain, the cute little conical cottage in Puglia, beach apartment in Cyprus, bolthole in Paris… all favourite British property investments, and hitherto unthreatened by discriminatory taxation or property laws –\u0026nbspbut perhaps no longer.\u0026nbspThere might also be some effect on the popularity of your place if you let it out to UK holidaymakers, many of who will obviously be stuck\u0026nbspin Blighty\u0026nbspeating the cheese and wine reserves they’ve built up (see point 4).Post-Brexit, there may be less certainty that British citizens, resident or not, will enjoy the exact same property rights and tax equality they do now. On the other hand, if the euro, Bulgarian lev or Croatian kuna strengthens against the pound, other things being equal, then the sterling-equivalent value of your real estate may go up.\u0026nbspThere again, fears of a collapse in sterling may be exaggerated\u0026nbspbut it is something again you need to be aware of.8. Double-check the family treeYour ancestry, and one or two other conditions, might help you apply for a passport of another EU member state, should you want one.Don’t forget that although dual citizenship is permitted in the UK, it isn’t available\u0026nbspin all EU states, so you need to check if necessary, make a choice.Usually some form of parentage qualification can deliver a new passport from an EU nation – though a substantial investment can also secure one (see point 6). You will usually need to register your birth, even if it was in Britain, with the country you wish to become a citizen of. Here are a few of the basics to get the ball rolling (though there is much devilish bureaucracy in the detail so beware)...Surge in British people obtaining EU citizenship, new data revealsItalian citizenship: by being born\u0026nbspto an Italian parent and, in some circumstances, via an Italian grandparent. Or by naturalisation – at least 10\u0026nbspyears’ residency.Irish citizenship: yours if\u0026nbspsome of your parents or grandparents were Irish\u0026nbspor, under some circumstances, by marriage to an Irish citizen.\u0026nbspNaturalisation by residency will also get you an Irish passport.Spanish citizenship: for British expats it is possible\u0026nbspto obtain Spanish citizenship via residency, but you will have to surrender your\u0026nbspBritish citizenship – toss a euro\u0026nbspfor it. Alternatively, once you have lived in Spain for five uninterrupted years, you can apply for an “EU long-term residence permit”, which enables you to work and live in Spain on the same basis as Spanish citizens. You can\u0026nbspalso apply if you have a Spanish father or mother.Cypriot citizenship: been married to a Cypriot for at least three years? Time to celebrate!\u0026nbspCypriot parentage will also do the trick,\u0026nbspas will\u0026nbsp“citizenship by investment” – a property worth at least €500,000.\u0026nbspIt might be prudent to make sure your next prescription gets filled in good timeMaltese citizenship: naturalisationresidency for five years should do it. But here too there is a chance of flashing the cash via the Malta Inidual Investor Programme – at least €500,000 in various combinations of Maltese government bonds, and the National Development and Social Fund. Five years of marriage to\u0026nbspa Maltese citizen is another route.\u0026nbspMost EU and EEA countries (eg Norway, Switzerland) are members of the Schengen scheme, meaning no border checks in any case for EU citizens.9. Order your European-made fridge, washing machine, dishwasher…Much the same arguments apply to consumer goods as they do to cars, though the prevalence of Chinese-made products (sometimes with European brand names) means that the possible delays and inconvenience are somewhat less for this class of goods. However, if you really desire a German-made Miele washing machine you might be wise to make a move on one now.10. Buy your foreign currency\u0026nbspnowI don’t have a Brexit crystal ball any more than anyone else but it seems reasonable to conclude that a\u0026nbsphard Brexit, the nearer it gets, could well bring about a hefty depreciation of sterling – as happened the morning after the 2016 referendum, when the pound lost about 15 per cent of its external value (though it did gradually recover). Then again, whenever there is a wave of optimism about the talks, sterling tends to rise. The pound would be expected to slide against all the major currencies in an unexpectedly chaotic scenario, so\u0026nbspif you wish to be cautious\u0026nbspyou could get your euros, dollars, roubles and rupees in now.11. Stock up on medicinesAssuming they have a long shelf life, that is. This is one of the most vexed of all the post-Brexit questions, about which we have heard a lot from politicians. All one can say now on the question of imported medicines is that they will, under UK law, be OK to use\u0026nbspin Britain if they’re already EU approved, as we will adopt all the European Union regulations from day one\u0026nbspof Brexit. However, like so many other goods, there may be delays in transportation, and it might be prudent to make sure your next prescription gets filled in good time. The UK has a competitive pharmaceuticals sector, for now\u0026nbspthere is a reasonable chance that your pills and potions can be sourced by the pharmacy. Keep a weather eye\u0026nbspopen for updates.12. Au pairs, tenants and employees: let\u0026nbspthem go now or hang on for dear lifeWithout a legally sound withdrawal agreement, the rights and status of EU citizens living and working in the UK will need to be clarified, and there is no sign of that yet. Some may decide to leave the UK, even after many years here, which will inevitably\u0026nbspcause great disruption.\u0026nbspYou may therefore\u0026nbspwish to make some contingency arrangements of your own if, say, you rent a house to a Slovak family, have a French au pair or employ workers from Poland. The short story is that they may be hard to replace.13. Take advantage of “the exciting opportunities” offered by BrexitJoking aside, there will be some potential benefits for the new “global Britain”. If you’re the entrepreneurial type, you might well want to seek out new trading opportunities in China or India, as (or\u0026nbspif) tariffs and other restrictions that are now levied on goods and services in either direction are lifted. That could happen as a result of unilateral UK action or, in the longer run, through the kind of ambitious trade deals ministers talk so frequently\u0026nbspabout.All in all,\u0026nbspnow may be a good\u0026nbspmoment to start that business advising Indian students about how to get a visa and apply for a course at a British university. Provided of course the government finds such an arrangement with India that is compatible with its migration targets.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Engage in some cross-border arbitrageNot smuggling, you understand, but legitimate trade exploiting anomalies in inidual markets.If the Troubles return post-Brexit, it won’t just be due to the borderThis may be of especial interest to people living near the Irish border, who will have to make the most of whatever is coming their way this\u0026nbspspring. On the one hand, the prices\u0026nbspof various goods will erge because of movements in the exchange rate,\u0026nbspas well as duty, taxation\u0026nbspand regulation. The opportunities will be obvious. On the other hand, the EU or UK may decide to instal more stringent customs controls than before it’s\u0026nbspa sensitive subject. Or they could just forget about Ireland and leave things as they are, tolerating a certain amount of cross-border economic activity. Let’s be honest, no one knows.15. Watch your phone billOne of the greatest of the positive practical differences the EU Commission made in recent years was to cut mobile phone roaming rates among EU states.\u0026nbspIt is not yet clear whether\u0026nbspthat regulation will survive the Brexit process, although it may be caught by the UK withdrawal legislation.16. Check your flightOpinions, even at this relatively late stage, differ on how easy air travel will be post-Brexit. There are many EU regulations that govern passenger air transport\u0026nbsp(and freight for that matter). These\u0026nbspmay be overcome by UK-based\u0026nbspairlines setting up subsidiary companies in the EU\u0026nbspbut carrying on with business as usual – or not. Once again, confusion is the most likely outcome, and you may wish to exercise caution about booking your next flight.17. Learn to love your local uniThe future of European educational projects such as the Erasmus exchange scheme is under active discussion. More broadly, EU students can come and study in Britain at UK tuition fee rates, and that may not be so in future. By the same token, British students going to study in the EU may find themselves facing new fees and charges,\u0026nbspas well as having to factor in the impact\u0026nbspon their living costs of potential shifts to the exchange rate.18. Beware the expat lifeJust as there will be much uncertainty about the future of EU citizens in the UK, so there will be for those Britons living happily in EU countries, working or retired. There will be many issues to consider, some covered above: the cost of healthcare taxes on\u0026nbspproperty and income the payment or uprating of the UK state pension payment of local social security benefits gyrations in the exchange rate,\u0026nbspand the value of real estate across borders\u0026nbspremitted income from the UK the right to bring other family members to come and live with you voting rights and much else.19. Watch out for the RockSounds sinister – but not meant to be. Many Britons have links to Gibraltar, not just for financial reasons. Thus far\u0026nbspan under-discussed aspect of Brexit, Gibraltar is another UK territoryEU land border that raises an awful lot\u0026nbspof questions. The situation is made trickier because the EU has\u0026nbspgranted Spain a veto on future arrangements on Gibraltar. Nothing could change, perhaps\u0026nbspor “concessions” may only amount to the Spanish police having a role at the airport or the Spanish could decide to make life at the border more difficult, even though many Spanish workers rely on Gibraltar for their livelihoods.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march20. Don’t count on future working visits to the EUBy analogy with the US, if things really do get nasty\u0026nbspthen visa-free EU travel may be restricted to holidays and leisure. “Work”, even on a temporary assignment, may be treated differently, as it is by the\u0026nbspStates. Thus a special visa from the EU Belgium\u0026nbspmay be required if, say, a journalist wishes to go to Brussels, ironically, to report on the EU’s activities.\u0026nbspLikewise, an architect who wants to go Prague to supervise some construction work may need\u0026nbspan EUCzech permit. That’s because\u0026nbspif the UK\u0026nbspleaves the single market, British qualifications will not necessarily be recognised by EU states, as they tend to be now. Once again, a “worst case scenario” possibility that has\u0026nbspnot been much discussed.\u0026nbspSo there we are then. With luck, Britain won’t leave the EU at all certainly the pressure for a Final Say referendum is growing by the week. Or maybe we will do so in name only, or perhaps\u0026nbspacross a smooth, seamless transition that will take many months. Then again, Brexit hasn’t enjoyed much luck so far…\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It works by throwing out an array of 30,000 infrared lights, which hit the holder\u0027s face – a sensor in the camera can then see where they fall and check whether the right person is holding the phone.Cheaper, colourful version of latest iPhone finally goes on saleBut when the light is especially bright – on a sunny day, for instance – those invisible lights within the phone can get thrown off and the facial recognition sensor can have trouble seeing its owner.The new feature will improve that by better illuminating people\u0027s faces. The new sensor and its better lights will lower the impacts from visible lights of environment in order to improve the Face ID user experience, according to the report first spotted by\u0026nbspMacrumors.In addition to those new features, the updated version of the Face ID sensor could also allow it to use time of flight calculations to make 3D models of the things it is looking at. That technology works by throwing out a piece of light and seeing how long it takes to bounce back, and then using that to work out the distance – similar to something like radar.If Apple were to integrate that, it would allow the phone to use its modelling software to create augmented reality features to improve tools like the Animoji feature, for instance.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But as they scrambled to research it, the rock made its way out of the other side of our solar system, giving researchers only a glimpse to make the most of.In that short time, astronomers established that the object was moving strangely. It was spinning very quickly as it flew through the solar system, and seemed to speed up rather than slow down as it goes.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

If so, that might have happened by accident – or the object might in fact be a spacecraft made by an alien race, they said.Alien asteroids could have brought life to Earth from spaceThe object might be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth vicinity by an alien civilisation, the researchers write.It is not the first time that astronomers have suggested the rock could potentially be an alien spacecraft. Soon after it was discovered, researchers with the Breakthrough Listen project announced they would be monitoring it and seeing if it was sending out radio signals.The new study, written by\u0026nbspShmuel Bialy and Abraham Loeb, looks at the way that solar radiation could be used to power the object as it flies through space. They calculate that it would have to be very thin but very wide – and that such a shape would be possible.If they are right that the object is being propelled by radiation pressure from the sun, then it will be a breakthrough even if it is entirely natural. Such an object would be of a kind never before seen, most likely formed by an entirely unknown process happening deep in space.But it might in fact be artificial in origin, they write. One\u0026nbsppossibility is that ‘Oumuamua\u0026nbspis a\u0026nbsplightsail, floating in interstellar space as a debris from an advanced technological equipment, the authors claim, and it might be unused debris that has\u0026nbspbeen thrown out into space from a planetary system.Such an explanation would account for the various strange characteristics of Oumuamua, including the unusual shape it seems to have.Scientists on Earth have already looked to develop that kind of technology, which would be used to make tiny spacecraft that could be shot through space at intense speed and be pushed only by light. It might already have been developed elsewhere, they write, and could be used for transporting cargo between planets or even between stars.But even more strange is a theory that the rock could have been sent here on purpose. Alternatively, a more exotic scenario is that ‘Oumuamua may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth vicinity by an alien civilization, they write.Oumuamua is now too far away from Earth for scientists to understand any more about it. But more could be found by looking into the solar system for more objects of this type, the authors say – which could happen more in coming years, as new ways of surveying the sky are turned on.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Voters faced a choice between a known reality and an unknown alternative.“In the campaign, untestable claims took the place of facts and reality.”Human rights specialist Jonathan Cooper, a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers, said: “The current state of the Brexit negotiations is worrying people throughout the UK and the legal profession is no exception to that.“We represent people from across industry and society and we see every day the way the prospect of a catastrophic Brexit deal is already causing real harm.“This letter to the prime minister has been signed by over a thousand of my colleagues who are convinced that not only is a people\u0027s vote the right thing to do, it is the most democratic thing to do as well.”A Department for Exiting the EU spokeswoman said: “The people of the United Kingdom have already had their say in one of the biggest democratic exercises this country has ever seen and the Prime Minister has made it clear that there is not going to be a second referendum.“We remain confident we will agree a mutually advantageous deal with the EU.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There may yet be a Brexit agreement on the Irish border. The latest whispers out of meetings in Brussels are that the EU is preparing to offer a compromise solution on the so-called “backstop”. Whether it will be enough for the UK remains to be seen.But let’s suppose it is, and a withdrawal agreement is signed. Does that prevent a no deal? Not exactly.There are two things that could still cause a no-deal Brexit. Both bring a huge degree of uncertainty.EU plans compromise on customs union to solve Irish borderThe first is the parliamentary vote. Theresa May, you may remember, has no majority in the House of Commons and needs help. How the DUP, Labour, and Conservative Eurosceptics\u0026nbspvote will determine whether a deal passes parliament, even if it has been agreed between\u0026nbspnegotiators.The second uncertainty is over the future trading relationship. An outline of this was supposed to have been agreed by now, but the timetable has slipped because of a lack of progress on Northern Ireland, which the EU insists must be dealt with first.\u0026nbspIt is not widely understood that UK law states that this outline of the future relationship has to be presented to MPs before any vote on the withdrawal deal. But it is simply not clear how this will be possible.\u0026nbspTheresa May’s Chequers plan has been dismissed, and she has rejected the EU’s options of a loose free trade agreement or Norway-style single market participation. Negotiations are practically at square one for this, with practically no time left.It is widely claimed that any document will have to be a fudge. But the EU said at the Salzburg summit that any outline must be specific – not just a list of vague aspirations.Brexit talks ‘close to a deal’ says DUP leader Arlene FosterGovernment urged to revive fishing for endangered tuna after BrexitArron Banks is hoping to become some kind of Brexit martyrUK construction dogged by Brexit uncertainty in OctoberHow agreement could be reached on anything substantial is unclear, and neither side looks able to back the other’s proposals. It’s possible the issue of the trading relationship could make a comeback and sink the whole thing.And yet, if we cannot sign a deal, Britain may still avoid heading over the cliff edge.\u0026nbspThe government says emphatically it is prepared to go ahead with a no-deal Brexit, but the truth is the country is simply not prepared. The physical infrastructure needed is not in place and will take years to build, at ports, airports, and elsewhere.\u0026nbspThere is certainly not a majority in the House of Commons for a no-deal, and the political damage to the government of going ahead with one far outweighs any benefit.However, there remains the option to revoke Article 50 – even temporarily – before March 29.\u0026nbspEmpty supermarket shelves, grounded flights, and queues at ports are a prime minister’s worst nightmare. Desperation to avoid this at all costs means that a\u0026nbsplast-minute government U-turn is more than just a possibility\u0026nbsp– it’s likely.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Chequers-type deal, as I say, if we don’t have friction with trade, then, economically, I don’t think it’s going to make a particular big difference one way or the other.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.EU nationals, living in the UK take part in a demonstration along Whitehall.

Ms May told her counterpart she was still committed to a full backstop, despite Mr Raab’s comments.Speaking earlier in Dublin Mr Varadkar\u0026nbsphad said a time-limited backstop as suggested by Mr Raab\u0026nbspwould not be worth the paper it was written on.“As a government we’re working very hard to get an agreement, ideally by\u0026nbspthe end of the year, but you know one thing we can’t countenance is any idea that there’d be a three-month limit on the backstop,” he told the Irish media.“You know a backstop with a three-month limit on it or an expiry date of that nature isn’t worth the paper it’s written on, and what the UK government has\u0026nbspsigned up to is a legally operative backstop that will apply unless and until we have a new agreement to supersede it – and I think it’s reasonable for us to expect a country like the United Kingdom and a government like the UK government to stand by its commitments.”Varadkar\u0026nbsphad reacted angrily to Mr Raab’s suggestion\u0026nbsp(Reuters)Many Tory Eurosceptics are adamant that any backstop must be limited in time, to avoid the UK being signed permanently to a customs union with the EU after it leaves. The EU has said a time-limited backstop would not be a backstop because it would not prevent a hard border in all circumstances.Giving an account of the two\u0026nbspleaders’ conversation, a spokesperson for the taoiseach said:\u0026nbsp“Both leaders emphasised their commitment to avoiding a hard border and the need for a legally operable backstop.“The prime minister raised the possibility of a review mechanism for the backstop. The taoiseach indicated an\u0026nbspopenness to consider proposals for a review, provided that it was clear that the outcome of any such review could not involve a unilateral decision to end the backstop.“He recalled the prior commitments made that the backstop must apply ‘unless and until’ alternative arrangements are agreed.”A Downing Street spokesperson also gave an account of the call, providing less detail.\u0026nbspThey said:\u0026nbsp“The prime minister spoke to the taoiseach this morning to take stock of the progress being made in the negotiations, including on the Northern Ireland backstop. In a constructive conversation, the prime minister and the taoiseach discussed the remaining issues.“They agreed that the intention was that the backstop should only be a temporary arrangement and that the best solution to the Northern Ireland border would be found by agreeing a future relationship between the UK and the EU. In order to ensure that the backstop, if ever needed, would be temporary, the prime minister said that there would need to be a mechanism through which the backstop could be brought to an end.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

It will serve as an opportunity for businesses to reach people, he said.WhatsApp update finally brings stickers to messaging appThe status feature is something like the stories tool that appears in Instagram and Facebook, as well as WhatsApp. It allows people to post updates that will appear to all of their friends, letting them share photos or text and then letting it disappear afterwards.WhatsApp has struggled to come up with ways to show its users ads: without a feed, like Instagram or Facebook, there are few places for them to be injected.When it dropped its subscription fee in 2016, the company posted a blog post making clear that ads would never interrupt your communication, further adding to the issues about how advertising could be shown within the app.But the status feature appears to have solved that problem, allowing WhatsApp to slide marketing posts in between updates from friends, like it does with Instagram stories.As well as serving as something like a feed, WhatsApp\u0027s status feature has quickly become a huge part of the app. It now has a huge number of users, and is more popular than many major apps like Snapchat.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

For voters aged 30-39, turnout is up in all 41 states where data is available.In past midterm elections the perceived wisdom was that those who voted early were generally those who would be enthused to come out and vote anyway, but it appears that this may have changed this time around.One analysis from Democrat data firm TargetSmart suggests that more than 6 million of those ho have voted early rarely vote at all, and that more than 1 million others are first-time voters.Democrats are aware of what might be coming –\u0026nbspformer president Barack Obama was clear about that during a campaign stop in Virginia on Monday. He said that people had woken up\u0026nbspto the need to protect things such as equality and immigration rights at the ballot box.“All across the country, what I\u0027m seeing is a great awakening,” he said. “People woke up and said \u0027Oh, we can\u0027t take this for granted. We\u0027ve got to fight for this\u0027.”However, the fact that all these new early voters are from groups that may not have gone to the polls before means that they are unpredictable. Will the numbers hold up the same on Tuesday? Or will the early voter figures be a false dawn?Florida felons may soon be given back their right to voteObama gives inspirational rally speech to delighted Virginia crowdHow do US midterm elections work?How Asian American voters are ‘coming of age’ this election cycleA September poll for MTVAssociated Press found that 61 per cent of Democrats aged 15 to 34 said they felt anxious over the midterms. That could translate to turnout, but also could leave young people thinking their choice won’t matter.For a party that suffered the shock result of 2016, such reliance on figures that have not been tested has left many Democrats on edge.\u0026nbsp“We\u0027re kind of just in the bed-wetting phase now,“ Democratic pollster John Anzalone, a former Hillary Clinton campaign staffer,\u0026nbsptold Politico.All the signs are there that the Democrats might be able to at least retake control of the House of Representatives –\u0026nbspincluding the latest polling –\u0026nbspand other leading members of the party are acting upbeat.There were “opportunities to flip red to blue” across the nation, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez told a crowd in Wisconsin. ”We\u0027re focused on the issues that people care about,” he said. “If you look at the closing argument of Trump, it\u0027s a closing argument of fear and ision.”But having been bitten once two years ago, there are plenty fearing that another surprise might await them on Tuesday night.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

You could move the summit to the last few days of the month but you\u0026rsquod still require all of the various work to be completed by next Monday at the latest, before you could have a summit.Follow the Express\u0026rsquos live blog for Brexit updates:                Brexit LIMBO?

reaping all the benefits without having any of the obligations that full membership would entail.In June  European leaders said Britain was running out of time to do a deal because of the unsolved border problem.In July Theresa May quoted Shakespeare as she insisted the UK would not be broken up with a border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May has told EU leaders she is looking at ways of keeping Britain under their rules for at least another year as part of efforts to break the Brexit deadlock.Addressing the  national bosses at a tense summit in Brussels on the night of October , the PM said she is “ready to consider” extending the  month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March.The potentially incendiary move has been drawn up by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to try to end a bitter impasse over the Irish border.It would mean abiding by all Brussels rules until December  at the earliest.The news comes after talks on Sunday, October , hit a brick wall once again, as the issue of the Irish border continues to cause a headache for Theresa May.Theresa May has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea.However, talks broke down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland -the UKs version wasnt ready in time, according to Downing Street sources.Mrs May dubbed the continuing row with Brussels over how to avoid a hard border in Ireland as “the one real sticking point left, but a considerable one”.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004208757051-e1532011560868.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"no deal brexit explained house prices advice","story":"Some have warned of chaoswe crash out without an agreement - but just what does a no deal mean for the UK A no-deal British departure from the European Union means leaving without formal arrangements for the future relationship.Currently Britains trade, customs and immigration rules are tied up with the single market and a host of EU regulatory bodies.Ministers are seeking a legal deal to replace these with looser arrangements so we are outside the single market and customs union but keeping close ties so cross-border trade is easy.Negotiations are ongoing under Article  of the Lisbon Treaty ahead of the UKs exit on March , .Some fear these talks could collapse without a deal agreed before the deadline.This could mean the UK being treated as a third country by the EU with commerce governed by World Trade Organisation rules.Its reported DUP leader Arlene Foster believes the UK is set to leave the EU without a deal at all.Leaked emails say the Northern Irish leader was left furious after hostile and dficult meetings with the EU boss Michel Barnier.She is poised for talks to collapse totally between Britain and the EU, which would mean we would leave with no deal at all, the Observer reported.Mrs May is fighting back against opponents of her blueprint for Brexit, saying Parliament will have to choose between her proposal and crashing out of the European Union without a deal.It would mean scrapping a -month transition period lasting until the end of , and the exit would be immediate.Brexiteers say it would be a boost for the UK to be free from Brussels rules and we will be able to strike deals with other upcoming nations around the globe.We would also not be obliged to pay the £billion orce bill, according to a House of Commons report - but Chancellor Philip Hammond sparked fury by saying we would pay up even without a deal.Many people fear the UK economy would be hurt by a clf edge Brexit as trade is held up by new border checks and tarfs and more red tape for businesses.Doom-monger Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned house prices could crash by a third in a worst-case scenario.Customs checks on cross-Channel freight could cause havoc at ports, hitting food supplies and other goods such a motor parts.In a pure no-deal scenario, businesses would lose their passporting rights, which allow them to sell their services across the EU without having to obtain licences in each inidual country.A no deal would also see residency rights for EU nationals in the UK potentially disappear overnight.In theory, these people would become third country nationals, meaning they would be subject to domestic immigration rules.There is also uncertainty over what would happen at the  mile border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.The EUs rules may require Ireland to impose customs and other checks to protect the bloc’s border – which some say would mark ato the dark days of the Troubles.It could blow a hole in the Good Friday Agreement, with pressure on all sides to find a compromise.The government is releasing a series of Technical notices to help prepare British businesses and consumers for a no-deal scenario.A second tranche of papers has now been released by the validity of British driving licences on the continent, roaming charges for mobile phones and the future of the European space and satellites programmes.Anyone travelling to the EU should make sure they have at least six months left on their passport, although that will not apply to travel in Ireland.People applying for a new passport after Brexit will continue to get burgundy passports for a while - although they will not say European Union on the front coverBlue passports will start being issued from late The papers show:The government has released a set of contingency plans outlining the impact of a no-deal Brexit.The  technical notices’ drawn up by Whitehall cover areas including free trade agreements after the split, fishing policy and rail transport.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the Government is still striving to strike a good deal with Brussels, but added the documents showed the “unlikely” prospect of no-deal is being taken seriously.The latest batch of documents reveal how the UK will immediately regain control of its waters in a no-deal scenario.Here are the recent big Brexit developments:"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000445383459.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"snakes in the city hunters","story":"Hes been underground for an hour on a perilous rescue mission - but hes not trying to help a lost child or pet - hes actually down there to rescue an enormous snake which has escaped.While most of us would be terried to come across a ft python, Simon and his partner, Siouxsie Gillett, both , work as professional snake catchers.Siouxsie, from north London, and Simon, from Hertfordshire, are the stars of Snakes in the City, a Nat Geo show which follows the pair as they travel around Durban in South Africa wrangling killer cobras and pesky pythons.Theyve had to remove dangerous creatures from peoples homes, gardens, cars - and even a hearse - and have amassed their own menagerie of over  snakes, including dangerous breeds whose bites can kill in minutes.When they catch a snake where it doesnt belong, they transport it away from civilisation and release it back into the wild, but they do so knowing that each job could be their last.We are in situations where we are facing death, Siouxsie tells Sun Online. Every day you dont know whether youll come home that night.The reptile-loving couple have the ideal background for a pair of snake wranglers: Siouxsie is a herpetologist - someone who studies amphibians - and used to work in a zoo, while Simon has spent most of his le breeding and collecting snakes.They also run a snake sanctuary in Dunstable, Bedfordshire - half a world away from the dust and heat of Durban.Despite all that experience, Simon has still found himself on the wrong side of a venomous snakes fangs - joking that his arm once swelled up to the size of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s after being nipped by a copperhead viper.And for Siouxsie, who has a rare allergy to snake venom, a bite from most dangerous breeds could kill her in just a few minutes.It is a huge risk, she says. We are very focused and driven to get the snake removed, so we try not to think about the danger too much.We love what we do and we know were very lucky. But usually afterwards the adrenaline kicks in and our legs start to buckle.While filming for Snakes In The City, Siouxsie came face-to-face with a very grumpy black mamba - Africas biggest venomous snake.The mamba, which Siouxsie nicknames psycho Sally, tried to bite her four times as she was capturing it. Thankfully, they all missed, butany of the mambas blows had landed, Siouxsie says she would have died within  minutes.The black mamba is just one of many dangerous snake breeds to call South Africa home - with spitting cobras, gaboon vipers and puff adders among the most notorious species living in the cape.Many people will resort to killing any of these snakesthey spot them on their property, so youd think that locals would be willing to pay well for the dangerous and humane work of a snake wrangler.However, Simon only charges the equivalent of £ per call-out, and has to work as a er and tattoo artist on the side to make ends meet.You dont make money by catching snakes, Simon says.We go to a lot of rural areas where they dont have money to pay someone to come out.Its a passion, and a lot of the time we have to use our own money to save them.For Simon, its a small price to pay to be around the creatures he loves.When he moved to South Africa in , looking for a change of scenery, the abundance of snakes offered him a chance to follow his dream.I wasnt sure what to do for a job but Id always dealt with snakes, he tells us. I used to import snakes, breed them and teach people about them.Then after a few months in South Africa I started moving snakes out of peoples garages, schools, trucks or whatever and releasing them back into the wild.I was doing from  to  callouts per month. It kept me very busy.Simon and Siouxsie met through the small world of the UKs venomous snake community and started dating five years ago, after Simon began working in a reptile store which Siouxsie managed.When most couples have meals out and go to the cinema during their honeymoon period, we were out catching deadly snakes together - which is quite the norm for us, Siouxsie jokes.Today, the pair are Durbans go-to couple to help with any snake problems, and theyve been able to save thousands of serpents from certain death.But they still often find themselves in situations where one wrong move could end it all.Simon tells us that he once got into a truck where a black mamba was lurking just inches away from his face, narrowly missing him when it leapt from its hiding place.Siouxsie adds that one of her most challenging rescues was for a man who didnt want a python removed from his home because he believed it was his reincarnated grandfather.We had to respect his spiritual beliefs, Siouxsie says. But at the same time there are laws around owning pythons as theyre a protected species.Then the next day, the guy called to say his grandfather had eaten his chickens, and askedwe could come back to collect him after all.The couple spend six months each year back in Britain, where they keep one of the countrys largest licensed collections of venomous snakes at their Dunstable sanctuary.Siouxsie and Simon, who got his first pet snake at , now count  serpents among their beloved pets.And thankfully, they have brave friends who are happy to help look after their enormous collection, which includes rattlesnakes, cobras, pit vipers, boas, tarantulas, scorpions, giant frogs, lizards... and a couple of plain old dogs.The pair fill their Instagram feeds with snake selfies, and say that despite the danger, they wouldnt change a thing about their unusual career.We love it, Siouxsie says. Its what were driven by and the focus is always on the snakes.Our drive is to get that snake removed before any harm is done to it. We love what we do. Were very lucky.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

even a small part - of creating all these wonderful kids.I dont know for sure how many kids there might be - the sperm bank doesn’t have complete records.Peters situation raises worrying ethical concerns about donors in the States.While in the UK donors can only legally father  children, across the pond there are no limits and regulations.This is something some of Peters donor kids are concerned about.Sun Online joined Peter and seven of his kids on a family outing in Los Angeles, where they played an Escape Room game and went for a vegan Italian meal.Peter and the children have a designated Facebook group and spreadsheet to help them keep in touch and plan meet-ups.Many of the kids have similar physical or personality traits, and bizarrely they all seem to get on like they’ve known each other for years - even though some of them have only met in the past month.Theatre director Peters donor children live all over the US and the world - including France and China.Theyve not managed to get all  together at the same time but hope to one day.Sidney, is the youngest of the siblings at  and had no idea who his donor father was until he took a DNA test on the website andme, which matches people with their genetic relatives.“I have two moms so I always knew I had a donor father but he was completely anonymous,” Sidney explained.“Then I took the test and got connected with my sister Rachel and brother Peter and we kept growing.“It’s weird to say that you have become friends with your siblings because usually you grow up with them, but in the past year that’s what’s happened to me.“It’s great for me because I’m an only child so I haven’t grown up with brothers or sisters so it’s nice now to get to go out and hang out with my siblings.“It’s funny when I tell people that I have  siblings because they don’t believe me - they think I’m lying.”Peter’s donor daughter Rachel was the first one to reach out to Peter.She had already managed to locate  of her donor siblings using the donor register and andme.Pooling together dferent information they had been given from their parents, they figured out that their dad was an actor from Los Angeles and they knew his name.She put the name into a movie database and found a “Peter Ellenstein”, then managed to track him down on Facebook.Musician Rachel, , said she was most interested in seeing a picture of her biological father and learning a little bit more about “where she came from and how she got here”.Rachel and Peter hit it off and became very close - now they speak to each other most days and even enjoyed a holiday to France together, where they visited another donor sibling.Peter described meeting Rachel for the first time - via video chat - as “dferent than anything Id ever felt before.”He said: “It was a profound feeling looking at someone who so clearly resembled me and some of my mannerisms and it turned out we had all kinds of things in common.“We actually met the next day in person and we hugged for a long time and cried and talked.Rachel told him she had made contact with  other siblings and over the course of the year Peter began meeting them.Another  kids then came forward over the next year - with the most recent two coming forward just three weeks ago.Peter said his friends and family have all reacted dferently to the news of his new family - but his -year-old mother is delighted to suddenly have so many grandchildren.“The reactions of everybody have been all over the map,” he said.My mother is thrilled she says, the more, the merrier’.Peter, who donated sperm for about six years - sometimes as often as five times a week -says he tries to let each of his children decideand how they want to meet - and they also decide what they want to call him.Some call him “DNA dad”, “donor father”, “lab dad” or just plain old Peter. Others refer to him as father or dad.Alana, , who has a twin sister Bridget, said she was more interested in meeting other siblings - than gaining a new dad - but is glad that she has met Peter.“We were raised by a mother and a father so we already had that father figure,” she said.“For us we wanted to know about our other siblings and find outwe had anything in common with them, were there were any similarities  Do we look like each other “My mother told me when I was  that we had a donor father and I was always curious but it wasn’t until  that we tracked down any siblings.”And although Alana and Bridget are “super excited” about suddenly acquiring so many siblings - they do think there should be more regulation on how many children can be created from one man’s sperm.“I think there should be a cap - we are probably going to be hitting  soon in the next year - it’s a lot,” she said.“There’s so many of us that live in Calornia too - whatwe fell in love with someone and they turned out to be a sibling  That would be terrible.“Some of the siblings have already figured out that they knew each other from before - from being in the same classes - but they didn’t know they had the same donor dad.“I sometimes wonder when I’m looking at people walking down the street or on the bus - whatthat’s my sibling Peter says he says he is careful not to try and replace anybody’s actual parents.Most of the real parents have been supportive - some have felt a little concerned but theyve soon come around when theyve seen the benefits for their kids having so many siblings, Peter explained.“I feel like I get to be a part of  dferent adventures.“I didnt have any children of my own. I had a step daughter with my ex we but Id never raised my own kids.“And when I first saw Rachel, part of my brain and a part of my heart opened up that I didnt know that I had before. And I cant really explain what it is.“It was a mixture of sort of a sense of longevity, of purpose, wonder. Im really just feeling things that Id never experienced before.”Peter and his donor kids are now eagerly waiting to seemore of his children come forward.And its clear thatthey do, they will be welcomed into the unique donor family with open arms. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Netherlands and Spain were the only other EU countries in the top ten.That is some achievement for the UK. And demonstrates that the people who know where to invest, know it should be in the UK.They know we live in a dynamic nation, brimming with potential.So as we leave the European Union, we should remember the many reasons investors choose to put their money here in the United Kingdom, which is one of the world’s largest and most successful economies.We are at record levels of employment. Our success is underpinned by a legal system whose reputation is second to none. We have a skilled workforce and a low tax and a well-regulated economy.We are home to some of the finest universities, our research and development capabilities are cutting-edge and our financial institutions world-leading.We are in the right time zone to trade with Asia in the morning and the United States in the afternoon — and, of course, we speak English, the language of global business.Plus, there is serious global momentum behind businesses in the UK. We continue to attract more Foreign Direct Investmentthan anywhere  in Europe. And we are the number one choice in Europe for key strategic investments, such as headquarters. So it’s easy to see why more than , new businesses start up here every day.And it isn’t just small and medium-sized businesses. The UK has created  of Europe’s  companies valued at more than billion.Only this week Monzo, the British bank which operates through an app on your phone, secured £million of investment in order to double its workforce. This raised the company’s value to the £billion mark just three years after its formation.This is a fantastic vote of confidence in the UK and yet another sign that we have plenty to be optimistic about after we leave the EU.Investment creates jobs across all parts of the UK, pumps money into our communities and improves the lives of millions of people.Last year, FDI created , new jobs in the UK as well as safeguarding another ,.One reason we are seeing so much success is that this government has built an environment that makes investment and job creation easy.We are champions of free trade and we actively encourage businesses of all sizes — from start-ups to large corporations — to build trading links in all corners of the world.This weekend I’ll be representing the UK at the China International Import Expo in Shanghai where we are a “country of honour”.Over recent months, China has started to open up its market for UK goods and services, including dairy products, potatoes and petrol stations.And, this weekend, we intend to build on these achievements and create even more exciting opportunities for British companies.We also possess world-class talent. For example, we excel at research and development, which means that overseas companies want to tap into British expertise to advance the quality of their products. In last week’s Budget, we announced a further £.billion to strengthen the UK’s global leadership in science and innovation — that brings the total to £billion invested in research and development since .We want a partnership with business to make our country prosper.The Government’s Industrial Strategy includes innovative deals agreed with inidual sectors to attract investment. We are already reaping the rewards.The global marketplace never slows and we, too, must never stand still.Building on our impressive investment success, I have implemented the High Potential Opportunities scheme, which will deliver growth where it is most needed, often to previously overlooked areas.The success of the AgriTech programme in the West Midlands town of Telford and Leicestershire’s leading space sector cluster are proof the benefits of global investment are being felt in every part of the country.Over recent months, the Department for International Trade has led a series of investment roundtables, promoting UK industry to a global audience and driving foreign direct-investment into the UK as we prepare to leave the European Union.So far, these events have centred on tech, le sciences, automotive and agri-tech sectors and will soon start to focus on areas such as the creative industries.Initiatives such as this are going to be key in the coming months as we develop the UK’s own independent trade policy for the first time in more than  years.Working with businesses in the UK and overseas, I am determined to continue generating this flow of good news.But the facts tell a dferent story: Confidence in Britain is riding so high around the world that foreign investors are betting on it like never before.New UN figures show that in the first six months of  we were second only to booming China in attracting investment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We want to see vibrant hubs where people live, shop, use services, and come together.I recognise that these challenges are linked. Empty shops and decreasing footfall on the high street can contribute to social problems such as crime, unemployment and loneliness, while successful high streets can make communities stronger.That is why this week I am launching the new Open Doors project to help regenerate the high street and support community groups.The scheme will match landlords of vacant commercial units with community groups offering vital services to younger and older people. The aim is to reduce loneliness among our most vulnerable members of the community, whilst increasing footfall in town centres.We know that there are already some really successful examples of landlords working with community groups to provide premises on a temporary basis, to the benefit of both parties.However, we know that landlords may not be aware of the benefits of these arrangements, and community groups may not know who to approach or how to negotiate a temporary contract.This Open Doors scheme will help to overcome these barriers and bring vital services, as well as footfall, to local high streets.This announcement follows the Chancellor’s Autumn Budget which confirmed a new £. billion plan to support and transform the high street.In July this year, we asked Sir John Timpson, a businessman with more than three decades’ experience of what makes our high streets tick, to look at what’s needed to respond to issues currently affecting the high street.He recommended we set up a national body to strengthen local leadership and establish a new fund to support the renewal and reshaping of town centres.So, in this Budget provided a new £ million Future High Street Fund to help local areas adapt to changes and to prepare long-term strategies.The money will help improve transport links, redevelop empty shops, and restore historic properties, keeping our high streets fit for generations to come.We’ve also established a new High Streets Taskforce to help local leaders prepare and implement new strategies for their town centres.Small retail businesses will see their business rates bills cut by a third, saving them up to £ million over two years.These actions will help create a more level playing field for all retailers.It’s against this optimistic backdrop that I will outline my vision for communities at next week’s Locality Convention.I have been clear about my department’s priorities – building the homes this country needs, supporting and strengthening communities, and boosting local growth.Our resolve to deliver on these commitments has been bolstered by a bold budget.Our communities and our high streets will not be left behind.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Most blame him for Brexit.But his really unforgivable error was to see “Thatcher” as a dirty word and dodgy Tony Blair as The Master.As a result, he failed to win an outright majority in  and happily shacked up with treacherous Lib Dem Nick Clegg.He bet on another cosy coalition in , only to land a majority and the unwelcome obligation to deliver his promised referendum.Keep chillaxing, Dave.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heavily armed federal officers and bomb-snfing dogs were seen patrolling outside. You can expect the same today and for the cases four month duration. Airport-style metal detectors have been installed at the courthouse entrance and at the door of the courtroom itself to stop weapons being smuggled in.It is believed a helicopter will ferry him in each day to court from a high-security federal jail in Lower Manhattan.This is to spare New Yorkers the closure of Brooklyn Bridge which is needed to allow a heavily armed motorcade carrying El Chapo.His lawyers have argued this would spark anger among New York commuters and therefore prejudice his trial.Theres even been speculation over a special cell for Guzman being set up in the bowels of the courthouse where he will spend the night as the trial gets underway.The  jurors, who will remain anonymous and sit behind a screen, will be escorted by US marshals to and from court every day.And no ones hiding the ominous nature of the case from them.

Despite applying early thinking he would be all prepared, now hes around £ in debt.He told the Sun Online: “My paycheque in August messed me up completely. When September came along and I had to pay my rent for October, I didn’t have anything there.“I had no money in the bank, I had been paying to get my baby clothes and things, and I was left with nothing.”Universal Credit looks at the earnings in one calendar month to work out how much Brits can get paid. But any income they get in that time can mean benefits may be slashed.Because Simon got paid from his old job during his assessment period, he was then told he had to wait until the next month for any help. Overall this meant he went more than eight weeks for his first benefits payment.He’s just one of hundreds of people who have said they are being pushed into debt on the new benefits system, which rolls six payments into one monthly sum.Last week the Chancellor revealed that Brits will be able to get more help moving onto Universal Credit - but those changes won’t come in until .He also announced Brits will be able to earn up to £ more as a result of changes in the work allowance, but those won’t start to kick in until April either.Simon said: “It was all because of that first payment,I had applied later it wouldn’t have happened.“The balance on my journal said zero.“I’m overdrawn and getting bank charges because the money just isn’t there. It’s not a great start to taking care of my son.”Simon, who previously worked as an agricultural engineer making equipment for brewers, had to take out a £ emergency advance to help him out, and is maxing out his credit card too.“My rent is , that didn’t even cover it,” he added.“I’ve cut lots of my bills, but my council tax is still £, I have to pay for food for both of us, and I can’t get out of my TV contract until next year.“I’ve worked all my le and only had to claim Jobseekers once for a few months - that was a lot easier. If the system ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” he said.He thought he would be getting around £ a month in total in Universal Credit - which would include help with his housing, child tax credits, child benefit and income support.In his first month he got £, and his second month he got £ after the debts he owed were taken off.He’s now £ in debt and struggling to buy food and pay off bills.“Just because I had my final pay cheque in August, it’s messed me up for September onwards.“I’m overdrawn on my bank account, and getting overdraft charges because the money isn’t here.”Baylfs and debt letters have been coming in too - all since he first was forced to apply for Universal Credit.To make matters worse, he’s got a court summons because he’s behind with his council tax.But luckily kind friends and family have been helping Simon out buying clothes and nappies for his little one.“Finley will be  months soon, he’s teething and I’m doing it all on my own, it’s a struggle.“Winter’s coming too and with a baby you have to have the heating on.“I can’t move somewhere cheaper because my family network and support are all here. Universal Credit is just so stressful.”A DWP spokesperson said: “Universal Credit payments reflect a household’s circumstances as closely as possible during each monthly assessment period.“A person’s income during their first assessment period, including final wages, will therefore be reflected in their initial payment.

Fares have gone up % on average since , far outstripping pay growth. Some passengers have even been hit by increases of % and bus use is at a -year low. Arriva, FirstGroup, Go-Ahead, National Express and Stagecoach carry % of all bus passengers and have paid an average poundmillion a year in idends in the past  years. The most recent company records show they paid out idends amounting to pound,, from profits in the South East, pound,, in the North East, pound,, in the North West, pound,, in the Midlands and pound,, in London. Shadow Transport Secretary Andy McDonald said: “Our bus networks are being bled dry by greedy private operators. Labour will bring buses under public control and ownership in order to reverse bus cuts rather than fill the pockets of shareholders. “It is an outrage that bus companies enjoy colossal profits as thousands of routes are cut or withdrawn. The bus network has shrunk to its smallest size in decades and passenger numbers are plummeting.  “A combination of privatisation and Tory cuts is killing local bus services. “Labour would enhance and expand bus services, including providing free travel to under-s.” The research by campaign group Better Buses for Greater Manchester also found bus journeys had fallen by % in urban areas since the deregulation of services by the Tories  years ago. In London, where deregulation did not apply, passenger journeys on the franchised network have doubled and bus companies’ profits are around %, compared to % in cities where services are deregulated.The Better Buses for Greater Manchester findings are revealed as a campaign is launched today urging Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham to re-regulate services, bringing buses under public control. Pascale Robinson, of Better Buses for Greater Manchester, said: “The deregulation we have now means bus companies just run the routes they want to at a whim. They can charge what they like. “This means the big five bus companies are cherry-picking the profitable routes, making a killing, and it is us in Greater Manchester who suffer infrequent, unreliable and expensive buses.” Greater Manchester is one of the first cities to consider re-regulating its bus network, which would give the mayor the choice to put the public in control instead of the big firms. Ms Robinson said: “By this method bus firms are given controlled contracts to run the services we need, services which are reliable and affordable.  “We call on Mr Burnham to be bold and give us the bus network we deserve. We can’t keep letting these companies run a Wild West, charging through the roof for a patchy service.For every pound of idend given to shareholders in London,  journeys were taken. Elsewhere across the country, where buses are mostly deregulated except for a few small pockets, it was just under .” In Greater Manchester, passengers have complained that changes to the  Hazel Grove-Stockport service means taking two dferent buses to do the same journey, which used to pass by the hospital.They now need a pound. “day rider” ticket, adding pound to each journey.

Experts say investing in bus travel would bring benefits as peopleto towns and cities to spend their money. An analysis for Greener Journeys by auditors KPMG LLP shows that targeted investment to improve bus services would typically generate pound. of net economic benefit for each pound spent. Steve Chambers, of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: ”Across the country we are seeing the alarming impact this is having on communities, especially in rural areas, as people are being left isolated and unable to get to work, get to the shops, visit friends or access vital public services.  “The loss of bus services also has an adverse effect on congestion and air pollution as more people turn to cars, jamming up already congested roads.” Mirror reader and retired lorry driver Michael Palmer, , tells how a half-hourly service from his home in the North Fitzwarren, Somerset, to Taunton, is now every two hours, finishing too early for workers ing home. He said: “We are living in the st century, this is England, we should have the best public transport service in the world. Where did it all go wrong ” A Department for Transport spokesman said: “We provide around poundmillion every year to support bus services and a further poundbillion to support older and disabled people using the free bus pass scheme.” The Confederation of Passenger Transport UK, which represents bus and coach operators, said the idends paid were outweighed by investment, with Stagecoach investing poundbillion on around ,  new buses in  years.

As an inveterate user of public transport, I’m happy to be seen as a failure. The bus is a traditional part of the British way of le. It’s a place for gossip, getting to the shops, the hospital and to see friends, a moving theatre of society. No wonder On The Buses was so popular. The soap played to our affection for the bus. “Sit at the back for a longer ride!” But it’s getting harder and harder. Thatcher’s deregulation and privatisation of the industry was a failure for would-be travellers of any age. It brought fewer routes and higher fares – with profits and subsidies creamed off for investors, many of them foreign. I hear grumbles galore from fellow passengers about late and cancelled services. But it’s not the crews’ fault that the system isn’t working. The sell-off brought redundancies. The clippie went out with cost-saving one-man operation. Drivers face exhausting schedules. The Tories cut local government funding, so councils slashed subsidies to the companies, who take it out on the passenger. We’ve waited too long at the bus stop for an end to this rip-off.

The Chancellor had sparked fury when he handed schools a miserly poundmillion in last week’s Budget. He fuelled further anger when he said the tiny sum ided between them could pay for “little extras”. Teachers, parents, and education experts reacted with disbelief. Mr Hammond told MPs he was “surprised” by the backlash.  Speaking to the Treasury Select Committee, he said: “For most secondary schools receiving a cheque for pound,... will be money worth having. For anybody who feels it’s not worth having, there will be plenty of schools willing to receive the cheque.” He also rejected a claim the Tories were to blame for soaring class sizes, insisting they were “decisions to be made by school leaders”. Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner said: “Philip Hammond has completely missed the point. This is yet another insult to teachers shystruggling in the face of massive cuts.” Meanwhile, Mr Hammond insisted a delay on a pound stake limit on fixed-odds betting terminals until October  was to ensure an “orderly” process for the gaming industry.

Mr Alston, the UN’s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said: “The United Kingdom is one of the richest countries in the world, but millions of people are still living in poverty there,” he said. The special rapporteur added: “I think the UK is at a crossroads, partly because of Brexit, and partly because of the comments made by the prime minister and the chancellor in terms of austerity [being over].  “My hope is that there is a real possibility for a dialogue about future policy direction.” Alston has heard from nearly  people hit by poverty, civil society groups, academics and government officials - more than before any other country visit.

Kate Byrne, , had just finished singing karaoke in the busy pub when ex David Booth, also , launched his horrying attack. Kate was left drenched in blood and is now permanently disfigured despite surgery to reconstruct her lip after the attack. People would have thought he was kissing me but he launched at me and bit into my lip,” she said. The pain was horrendous, I was frozen to the spot. I didnt know it was off then but the blood was all down my face and my blouse. The police were phoned and they found my lip on the dance floor where he bit it off.  Kate was speaking after Booth, already serving time for attacking her, was sentenced to a further three years at Kirkcaldy Sherf Court for other violence offences against women. She’d just finished singing karaoke at a pub in Glasgow when controlling Booth lunged at her and sunk his teeth into her face. Panic rose among fellow pub-goers as they saw the grandmother drenched in blood. Last week Booth, of Fe, was jailed for three more years for assaulting, abducting and threatening her and an offence against another woman. He had already served time for the pub attack on January , , which left Kate permanently scarred. Kate described her experience with Booth as like a horror story. She met Booth, previously of Station Court, Leven, in January  through a dating website after the end of her marriage. At first she was unsure of the Amazon warehouse worker, who lived in Dunfermline at the time, but he persuaded her to go out with him and soon moved into her home in Moodiesburn. However, his jealously and controlling behaviour plagued their relationship from the start and he would become aggressive when she spoke to other people. Kate said: He tried to control you all the time. He always had to make sure he knew where you were and I had to answer the phone right away. If you didnt, he wanted to know why you missed the call. After a series of terrying assaults, the couple split up. But on January  he turned up at the taxi drivers home and insisted on accompanying her as she left for a night out with friends. In the Storm Queen pub an employee who saw him glaring at her from the bar had warned her to watch out. When she leaned over to speak to a man sitting at her table, Booth came over and angrily accused her of kissing him.  Later, as she finished her karaoke stint Booth grabbed her by the shoulders. Kate was rushed to the Southern General Hospital where her lip was reconstructed but she still suffers numbness and her speech is affected. Even when Booth was jailed, she feared he would come for her. She said: I had to put chains on my door, even though I knew he was inside. Kate believes Booth targeted her when she was at her lowest. She said: I felt totally worthless. I was told I could do better than him but I didnt believe it. Now in a happy relationship, Kate said she had been helped through the trauma inflicted by Booth by her new partner. She said: It took me about  months to deal with it, to get my head back on the straight and narrow. A jury at Kirkcaldy Sherf Court found Booth guilty of charges against Kate, of assault, detaining her against her will and behaving in a threatening and abusive manner towards her. The offences occurred at addresses in Chalmers Street, Dunfermline, and Glasgow in BJs pub between February  and January . He was also convicted of behaving in a threatening and abusive manner towards to the other woman at addresses in Leslie and Kirkcaldy between September and November . Non-harassment orders were made in respect of both women. The court heard Booth was in a new relationship and was engaged to be married.

As a train approached at mph, they embraced, walked towards the edge of the  and jumped on to the tracks. Heart-wrenching notes from Christopher and Melissa to their families were uncovered at their home in Doncaster in the days afterwards.  They apologised to their loved ones and said that they wanted to be together forever. Doncaster Coroners Court heard how Christopher and Melissa both struggled with heroin addiction. Housemates of the couple told police they had been on a huge bender lasting three weeks prior to their deaths. Toxicology reports found evidence of the class A drug as well as cocaine in their systems. Coroner Nicola Mundy recorded a verdict of suicide in relation to the incident, which occurred on March  this year. She said: They made the decision that they wanted to be together and they wanted to remain together.  They appeared to be happy and comfortable in each others company. The court heard emotional statements from both victims mothers. Melissas mum Lisa Wood said: I never suspected Melissa would commit suicide, she was always happy, bubbly and never stopped laughing.

Im comforted by the fact Christopher and Melissa died together and had each other.  Christopher and Melissa met while working at British Gas a couple of years ago but found themselves jobless in the months prior to their deaths. Last year they were evicted from their rented flat and ended up in a room in a shared house. Clinical psychologist Dr Abhi Salvaji, who dealt with Christopher and Melissa, said they both tried hard to beat their addictions.

The mum-to-be impressed fashion-lovers with her incredible looks - covering everything from comfy casual to red carpet glam from high street names, as well as designer brands. And communication coach Robin Kermode believes the pregnant duchess, , used her strategically picked attire to signal her strongly held beliefs. In total, it is estimated Meghans Down Under tour wardrobe cost pound,. The items of clothing with signicant meanings behind them include her pumps created out of recycled plastic water bottles, and jeans made by female victims of human trafficking and sexual exploitation. With the world of the eyes upon her, some of Meghans outfits have unsurprisingly sold out as fans rush to snap them up. The jeans made by female victims of sexual exploitation  On several occasions during the overseas tour, Meghan opted to wear jeans from Outland - including the Harriet pair, pictured above. The Australian brand was founded by James Bartle after he saw first-hand how human traffickers prey on vulnerable young girls in order to service the sex industry. Determined to making a change, James learnt that once a girl has been rescued and supported through her recovery, a sustainable career path is vital for securing her future. He created the Denim Project, to enable those girls who demonstrated an interest in sewing to put their new skills to use. Outlands team of seamstresses offer positions to those at risk of falling into poverty, and has broadened its mission to set a standard for the treatment and remuneration of young female workers in the garment manufacturing industry. It also sources ethically and environmentally sound raw materials, from organic cotton pocket linings to recycled packaging. After the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their engagement, they asked people who wanted to mark the occasion to donate to charities they had picked instead of giving them wedding gts. One of these charities included the Myna Mahila Foundation, which empowers women in Mumbai’s urban slums, by providing them with a trusted network, where they are supported professionally and personally to help them grow as iniduals and businesswomen. Thus Meghans Outland jeans reflect her desire to help vulnerable women which she has spoken so openly about. The vegan leather trainers  Meghan went comfy and casual as she donned white Veja V trainers while on a boat trip in Sydney during the Invictus Games. The trainers got everyone talking as they are environmentally friendly, and made from raw materials sourced from organic farming and ecological agriculture. Some of the shoes also use recycled plastic bottles and many have soles made from wild Amazonian rubber. The French fashion brands founders, Seacutebastien Kopp and Franccedilois-Ghislain Morillion visited clothing and food factories in South America, Asia and Australia while running a nonprofit group — and were appalled by what they saw. So in , they founded Veja in France with the vision of making trainers using the most ecological materials and ethical suppliers they could find. Fashion fans were delighted when they saw Meghan wearing a pair and the duchess is keen on environmental and conservation causes. The recycled plastic bottle pumps  Meghan wore Rothys flats twice on tour, including during a beach clean-up in Melbourne. The pumps are made from recycled plastic water bottles that would otherwise have been destined for landfill - and have been dubbed the most politically correct shoes on the planet by Vogue. The insoles on all of Rothy’s shoes contain recycled foam the rubber soles are made without environmentally stressful black carbon. The yarn comes from plastic and even the packaging’s made from post-consumer recycled materials. Meghan supports charity Surfers Against Sewage, which is a national marine conservation and campaigning charity. It inspires, unites and empowers communities to take action to protect oceans, beaches, waves and wildle. Hugo Tagholm, chief executive of the charity said: Our work as a national marine conservation charity empowers tens of thousands of volunteers annually to protect beaches for everyone. We are currently focused on tackling plastic pollution and this support will help us move towards our vision of Plastic Free Coastlines.” So it is very fitting Meghan wore the pumps during the beach visit - signalling her passion to protecting the sea from plastic. The sustainable brand  The Duchess of Sussex wore a stunning custom-made silk wool cocktail dress in dark navy by Gabriela Hearst at Government House in Wellington. The sustainable luxury brand is based on a less is more approach. Gabriela is a notable feminist designer and political activist. She wanted to create a brand that reflects a slower pace and process: where things are made with care and detail, where tradition is more important than trend, where there is a purpose to every piece, according to her website. She takes into consideration where materials come from and who is making them. Meghan wore the dress to deliver a speech to honor the th anniversary of female suffrage. The empowering dress  Meghan looked sensational when she wore a beautul white Theia dress for dinner with the King and Queen of Tonga. The label is inspired by the Greek Goddess Theia, who had an incredible power to turn everything that she gazed on to light. The Theia dresses are designed to make women feel confident – similar to Meghan’s beliefs. The website explains about their collection: Inspired by the Greek Goddess Theia, this evening wear, bridal and day dress collection was created to bring out every womans inner goddess. One of the original Titans, Theia, who ruled during the Greek Golden Age, possessed the incredible power of light which radiated from her sparkling eyes. All that she gazed upon glittered, becoming luminous and radiant. She imbued gold and silver with their shine. She gave diamonds their fire and rubies and emeralds their sparkle. Her three children Helios the sun, Celene the moon, and Eos the dawn, all continue to bring light in to the world everyday. The woman who wears Theia will be filled with confidence knowing her dress fits wonderfully and looks beautul on her, thus naturally allowing her inner goddess to shine.

They do look surprised when they see my birthday. I quite like being thought of as younger. Sometimes it annoys me a little bit because I feel like I look too young. I know that sounds stupid, but I just say I wish people would take me seriously like Im an adult.  I never felt like I looked older when I was younger. Even my mum used to say to me that I have a young face. Back in the day we didnt have contouring and all that stuff we do now. I had no clue how to do makeup and that kind of thing so maybe thats why I look older.I think my face has slimmed out a bit and my features show out a bit more too. I dont knowthats why I look younger now. But Alice admits she has wrinkles, and believes everyone should celebrate their imperfections. You can see imperfections in yourself more than other people can. I definitely have some around my eyes but I suppose everyone does really. Theyre your laughing lines. I really hope I carry on ageing well.

Lara Ollerhead piled on the pounds after having her children - Daniel,  and Sienna,  - and ballooned to a size  due to comfort eating. The -year-old says her expanding dress size restricted her from getting involved with family activities as she became out of breath from climbing just one flight of stairs. However, in March  the regional leader decided to make a change and joined Cambridge Weight Plan [CWP] and within eight months she had dropped down to st.  After losing a whopping st, Lara and her husband Simon Ollerhead, , renewed their wedding vows in August and she was able to wear a size  dress. Lara, from Cuddington, in Cheshire, said: “I was a bit of a comfort eater. Losing weight never really felt within my reach. I was just going to carry on le the same way. “I let my weight get away from me. It is shocking to think about the choices I made that I thought were alright and I know that they would have beenthey were in moderation. “I would start diets and just lose one or two pounds and think that it was never going to happen. “I think being told that as a child that we’ve got to clear our plates as a discipline from and that you have to finish, was ingrained into me. “I couldnt join in on the same things that my husband and children were doing. When they went to a trampoline park I would worry whether the trampoline could take my weight. It was embarrassing. “I would get out of breath after climbing one flight of stairs. I was so tired. My husband is very fit and healthy and the kids would ask why is mummy not coming  Your kids don’t understand.”  Lara, who previously weighed st lbs, completed Step  of CWP which involved having three of their products and one  calorie meals a day. After losing the majority of her weight, in October  Lara began Step  and had two of the CWP products a day along with a  calorie breakfast, a salad for lunch, a  calorie evening meal and ml of milk. Lara said: “When I joined CWP I realised that it could happen and you could do it in a controlled way. It taught me good habits and portion control. “There were normal people who had done it so I knew it was possible. “I feel like a completely dferent person and much more confident, you can’t buy this feeling. It has definitely changed my le. “I don’t worry about what people think and say anymore and I feel confident in my own skin. “I can also get more involved and go to the trampoline park and no longer get red-faced and out of breath. It is all of these little bits that the children are noticing.” Speaking of her vow renewal ceremony in Santorini Lara said: “The ceremony was incredible. It was the perfect setting and so relaxed. It was mazing to renew our vows as a family unit. “I felt a incredible in my dress and having the photos taken. I would have hated this and been reluctant to have had photos taken before”.  Lara said: “We had talked about renewing our vows with the children there but I didn’t think it could ever happen until I found CWP. “It was huge for us because I never thought I would have the confidence to do it. For the children to see us and commend us as a couple is incredible. “I wanted to be comfortable and I wanted to be able to get into a dress I always wanted to wear. He has never seen me this slim before and I wanted a really fitted dress. It was so exciting.” As well as renewing her vows, Lara also took on another challenge and climbed Snowdon, the highest mountain in Wales, with Simon in May  and completed it within three hours and  minutes. She also recently completed the National Three Peaks Challenge to raise funds for a local charity and to hopefully inspire others. Lara said: “It was tough going but not as tough as I thought it would be. He’s always wanted to experience climbing a mountain with me. I didn’t think I would ever have the fitness levels to do it. “Simon did the three peaks last year and I wanted to do it but I knew I wouldn’t be able to keep up with them. I wanted to prove that I could do it this time.  “I became really overcome with emotion when I could see the top but then I couldn’t catch my breath so I had to calm down. “It was the reality that I had conquered something that felt so far out of reach. We never imagined that I could do it and as fast. “I was so determined. I was actually running back down. It just seems mad but it felt brilliant. I am very impressed with myself.

Speculation has been re that Queen Elizabeth II, , will abdicate the throne so that her eldest son can become king and she can have some much-needed rest. She has become the longest-reigning monarch, on the throne for  years, making Charles the oldest and longest-serving heir in British history. Rumours have circulated that Her Majesty the Queen, who ascended the throne in  when she was aged just , has a secret plan to give everything up in three years for her son.  But this could all prove to be were to believe a comment the Queen reportedly made after the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI in . According to Vanity Fair, a friend of the Queen recalled her commenting on the Popes actions, saying: I would never do that. It means Charles probably has a long wait before he becomes king. The Queens same friend told how Her Majesty never sits down and her mind still works so fast. At the table, she was listening to three dferent conversations going on - jumping back and forth between them, they told Vanity Fair. But Prince Charles is reportedly quite pleased with his long wait to be king. “Charles figured out a very long time ago that he was going to be Prince of Wales for a very long time,” an English peer intimate with the royal family told the magazine.“He planned his le accordingly, and he wouldn’t have been able to accomplish half of what he hashe had become King earlier.” Charles has been very outspoken on climate change - something he wouldnt have been able to do as a reigning monarch. The Queen has also started to pass more responsibilities and duties down to her eldest son. Charles this year succeeded the Queen as Head of the Commonwealth and is currently in West Africa on a tour with we Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall.  The Duke and Duchess have visited The Gambia and Ghana and will travel to Nigeria before ing home to London. peaking at the time, Charles said: I am deeply touched and honoured by the decision of Commonwealth Heads of State and Government that I should succeed The Queen, in due course, as Head of the Commonwealth.

Traces of the deadly nerve agent , which went on to kill mum-of-three Dawn Sturgess, were found in the Italian restaurant.It has been on lockdown ever since undergoing decontamination but the the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs declared the restaurant safe after military teams carried out an intensive cleanup. Tonight it finally re-opened with a with Salisbury’s great and good being invited to enjoy a meal before it re-opens to the public on Tuesday.  Many of the staff who were on duty on that Sunday afternoon are still employed at the restaurant. One of them is restaurant manager Joe Pegg - who had only been in the post for a week before the Skripal scandal landed on his plate. He said: “We have undergone a complete refit and we’re really happy with the results. “It has been a long time coming but we always knew we would re-open Zizzi in Salisbury. “There’s no getting away from the fact that we were at the centre of a real drama and we can’t hide from that fact.  “But we are now looking forward and hope to welcome new and former customers back to the restaurant.” The eaterie in the centre of the city was cordoned off for months in which time it was discovered the Sergeis house was the epicentre of the attack with the agents believed to have spread the poison in his front door handle.

Also gone is the old wooden  which adorned the restaurant and in its place are murals of multi-coloured birds in flight. Phil Boyd, Zizzi operations director, said: “We’re excited that Zizzi is reopening to the people of Salisbury and we’re looking forward to welcoming customers back to enjoy the new-look restaurant and our new autumn menu. “It’s been a dficult few months for the city, so we wanted to take this opportunity to show our support for this brilliant community.” The restaurant will re-open on Tuesday with an event allowing diners to pay what they want for their meals.

Little did Asia Bibi know just how that moment of thirst in the hot Pakistani sun was to turn her le upside down and make her an object of virulent hate for years to come.Asia, now , had been picking berries with her fellow farm labourers. She was a Christian - and they were all Muslims. When the other women discovered she had drunk from their cup, they claimed she had made the water unclean and a quarrel broke out.Within days the mother-of-five had been arrested for blasphemy. She was sentenced to death by hanging and has spent eight years on death row in solitary confinement without even the right to see her young children. Last week - nearly ten years on - her conviction was finally overturned. ButAsia had imagined her ordeal was finally coming to an end, she was mistaken.  Pakistan’s new Prime Minister Imran Khan has bowed to pressure from hardline Islamists and promised to bar Asia from leaving the country. She and her family now fear she will be lynched by Muslim hate mobs as soon as she is allowed to leave prison andhome. On Saturday Asia’s layer Said Mulook fled Pakistan, saying he feared for his le after securing her freedom. And yesterday her husband, Ashiq Masih made a desperate appeal to Theresa May to help them flee the country, claiming his family were in grave danger. In a video, in which he also called on Canadian and US leaders for help, he said: I am requesting the prime minister of the UK help us and as far as possible grant us freedom. Earlier, in an interview with German broadcaster DW, he said he and his family were frightened that the government was handing them over to their deaths at the hands of lynch mobs. He said: The current situation is very dangerous for us. We have no security and are hiding here and there, frequently changing our location. My we, Asia Bibi, has already suffered greatly. She has spent  years in jail. My daughters were dying to see her free, but now this review petition will prolong her plight.  Their fears are not exaggerated. Pakistan’s hardliners have been baying for blood since the case first came to light, with thousands turning out in recent protests chanting they were willing to die to exact revenge and defend the Prophet. Two high-profile officials who spoke in Asia’s favour, former Punjab governor Salman Teseer and former Minorities Minister Shahbaz Bhatti, a Christian, were both assassinated. Teeser was shot dead by his own bodyguard. Asia herself nearly met her death last month when she was attacked by two men inside her prison cell. Her account of the fateful altercation in a field in the rural district of Sheikhupura in June  remains the same as the day she was first accused.She insists that she never disrespected the religion of her fellow fruit-pickers and that the women - one of whom was involved in a running feud with her family over some property damage - later fabricated the blasphemy case against her in order to “settle old scores”. Asia describes how she went to collect water for the others to drink while they harvested fruit. But when she arrived they claimed she had taken a sip from it herself. As a Roman Catholic, the other Muslim women complained that her faith had turned the water unclean. According to Asia, one of the women called her a filthy Christian, saying your Jesus didn’t even have a proper father, he was a bastard, don’t you know that  Asia said she responded: I believe in my religion and in Jesus Christ, who died on the cross for the sins of mankind. What did your Prophet Mohammed ever do to save mankind  Five days after the incident, Musarat, the woman involved in the feud with Asias family, brought a mob of people into the field where she was picking fruit, dragged her away and punched her in the nose. They accused her of the woman involved in the feud with Asia’s family, called, brought a mob of people into the field where she was picking fruit who dragged her away and punched her in the nose, accusing her of having insulted the Prophet.A local imam reportedly told Asia she could redeem herself by converting to Islam, but she refused to renounce her Christian faith - after which a mob beat her and members of her family in their home before taking her away to the police. A month later, a local police officer claimed she had said that the Muslim’s holy book the Quran was fake, claimed Mohammed had worms in his ears and mother and that he had married his first we just for money. Asia insists these claims are .As the case spiralled out of control, a local Muslim leader reportedly used the loudspeakers on his mosque to spread the news of the woman’s blasphemy, inciting local people to take matters into their own hands.Before they did, police took her away and she was imprisoned for over a year without being formally charged. In November , a judge sentenced her to death by hanging. The case sent shockwaves around the world. Despite numerous inconsistencies in the evidence presented in court, reporters said they dared not repeat Asia’s testimony in case they too were accused of blasphemy. Asia later described the day of her sentence: “I cried alone, putting my head in my hands. I can no longer bear the sight of people full of hatred, applauding the killing of a poor farm worker. I no longer see them, but I still hear them, the crowd who gave the judge a standing ovation, saying: Kill her, kill her!” The court house is invaded by a euphoric horde who break down the doors, chanting: Vengeance for the holy prophet. Allah is great!I was then thrown like an old rubbish sack into the van... I had lost all humanity in their eyes.  She spent the next eight years on death row, held in solitary confinement in an eight-by--foot cell without windows in a Lahore prison. Prison authorities claimed she was kept separate from other prisoners for her own safety, and even started giving her the raw materials to cook her own food. They claimed to be concerned that prison cooks might poison her food. . Meanwhile, outrage over Asia’s death sentence grew outside of Pakistan, attracting widespread condemnation. Over , people signing a petition for her relapse and the now-retired Pope Benedict XVI was among those to call for her release.During a visit to the UK earlier this year Husband Ashiq said: She is psychologically, physically and spiritually strong. Having a very strong faith, she is ready and willing to die for Christ. She will never convert to Islam. Asking for people’s prayers, he added: These prayers will open the door of the prison, and she will be released very soon. That breakthrough finally came on Wednesday, when Pakistan’s supreme court took the courageous decision to acquit Asia in an historic verdict, saying that the prosecution has categorically failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The judgement written by Justice As Khosa added: It is ironical that in the Arabic language the appellant’s name Asia means ‘sinful’. but in the circumstances of the present case she appears to be a person, in the words of Shakespeare’s King Lear, more sinned against than sinning.  However, the verdict sparked a wave of violent protests around the country, led by the anti-blasphemy group Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan . Angry mobs blocked major motorways, burning cars and lorries and carrying images of Bibi demanding her execution. The protests only ended after three days when the ruling Tehreek-e-Insafadministration signed an agreement with the TLP giving in to many of its demands, including a promise not to oppose a court petition to reverse her release and a pledge to put her name on the exit control listwhich would prevent her leaving the country. They also agreed to release without charge more than  people who had been arrested on charges of arson, vandalism and violence during the protests. Critics have accused Prime Minister Imran Khan of pandering to Pakistans hardliners and the lynch mobs. And they claim barring Asia from leaving the country is akin to handing her over to those who are determined to take away the le of a woman whose only “sin” was to take a sip of water from a bucket. Wilson Chowdhry of the British Pakistani Christian Association, said: Placing Asia Bibi on the ECL is like signing her death warrant. Ten years after that argument over a cup of water, and despite being declared innocent of any crime, Asia Bibi today remains in her cell - waiting to find outher decade-long nightmare might be coming to an end soon.

The bull bolted straight at Rauf, and although the -year-old managed to escape, he ran straight into the working saw-mill. As a result, his hand was severed by the blade.

Her chest appears covered by a white towel.Isoardi, , wrote on an Instagram post: Its not what we gave each other that I will miss but what we still could have given each other. With enormous respect for the true love that was, thank you, Matteo.  For the three years they were together, Salvini and Isoardi were often on the covers of Italian gossip magazines as paparazzi tracked them from the canals of Venice to the beaches of Mediterranean islands. Salvini, who is also interior minister and the leader of the anti-immigrant League party, was on a flight to Ghana when Isoardi told the world it was over.  Last Friday, a poll showed that most Italians viewed Salvini as the real head of government, with just one in six casting Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte in that role. The breakup found space among the top items of newspaper web sites and television broadcasts, along with stories about Romes war of words with the European Commission over its budget.

If it is successful, it paves the way for similar plants to be put in operation anywhere in the world. The project, reportedly worth pound million and named the Akademik Lomonosov, is currently docked in the northwestern port city of Murmansk in the Murmansk Oblast region. Scientists have confirmed they have successfully started its reactor prior to moving it.The huge ship measures  metres inand is  metres wide. It is said to be capable of producing around  megawatts of electricity, enough to power a town of around , residents. It reportedly weighs , tonnes.  Pavel Ipatov, Deputy Director of Russias nuclear power station operator Rosenergoatom, said: This is an obvious breakthrough in nuclear energy. Russia is the first country to receive this technology. It has very good potential. It is estimated the floating Chernobyl will be able to work for  years and will undergo technical checks every  years.The floating station will now float , miles from Murmansk to the northernmost Russian town of Pevek, in the Chukotka region.Vitaly Trutnev, Chief of the Building and Exploitation of Floating Nuclear Stations Department of Rosenergoatom, said: The potential capacity of the floating nuclear station is higher than is required in Pevek. But it is a big hub and the floating nuclear station will provide development for the whole region. According to reports South Asian and African countries are interested in the technology and may order floating nuclear stations for their own use in the future.Reports suggest the Akademik Lomonosov will power the whole north-west of the Chukotka region with five gold mines located there.The town of Pevek is one of the most important port and transporting hubs in the region.The region is currently powered by the Bilibino Nuclear Power Plant which is set to be shut down next year."},{"url":null,"title":"tiger run over tractor after","story":"NewsVillagers run tiger over with TRACTOR then beat it to death after it killed manWARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES Locals were incited to kill the endangered animal after it mauled a -year-old man to death earlier the same dayShareCommentsByTaniya Dutta:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsThe tigress who was brutally killed by being run over by tractor by the villagers in Dudhwa Tiger Reserve in Uttar Pradesh, India \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA tiger was run over by a tractor and beaten to death with sticks inside an Indian nature reserve, after the wild cat killed a villager. The brazen attack took place inside the core area of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, in Uttar Pradesh, India, on Sunday evening. Locals from the Chaltua village barged into the park after a -year-old man was attacked by the animal earlier in the day. He succumbed to his injuries, further creating tension in the village. They beat up the guards, stole their tractors and ran over the -year-old animal before killing it.The shocking incident comes just two days after another female tiger, Avni, who was believed to have killed  people, was beaten to death in a covert operation.  Ramesh Pandey, field director of the reserve, said: It is a clear case of a tigress being killed in cold blood. All the accused involved in the heinous act will be sent to jail. I have informed the principal chief conservator of forests about this incident. We have managed to retrieve the body of the tigress from the village and the autopsy will be done by a  of three doctors on Monday.  Officials said that the tigress had never injured any human in the past and only attacked the victim as he had intruded into the reserve forest taking a shortcut to his village. Mr Pandey added: The tigress had attacked the victim, who was trespassing the forest area, which is an offence. We will also book all the accused for attacking forest staff and looting the forest departments property and misusing it for killing the tigress.  Human-animal conflicts are very common in Indias rural areas, with scores of wild animals who stray into human habitations becoming victims of mob fury. The case has particularly shocked the nation because the man had strayed into the tigers habitat. Locals were later allegedly witnessed pelting stones at the elephants kept in the village for combing operations, and allegedly refused to talk to the forest officials. The village is situated deep inside the forest and the residents have refused all proposals of the forest department to relocate where because of their dependency on forest produce.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

The practice will also offer treatments currently not available on the NHS which will widen the range of available treatments such as white fillings in back teeth.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13513457.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Silverburn.jpg","title":"big changes set stagecoach bus","story":"NewsBig changes set for Stagecoach bus timetables in Ayrshire as operator ditches Silverburn serviceOperator Stagecoach said new timetables would \"better reflect our customers travel habits\".ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT NewsStagecoachs Ayr base \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSweeping changes are planned for the Stagecoach bus network - and the direct shoppers express to the Silverburn mall is to be put off the road due to lack of trade. Stagecoach insist they have to keep developing the Ayrshire network and fish where the passengers are. And they say: “These changes better reflect our customers travel habits. “A number of these changes will deliver improvements in reliability and frequency, while others will offer a service proportionate to demand.” The switches in service are planned to begin operating in January. The changes were discussed by the Ayrshire Bus Users Group in Troon on Saturday. Watchers are particularly interested in the failed route which served the Silverburn mall in Pollok at weekends. It was launched exactly two years ago with the now departed managing director Tom Bridge crowing: “Shopping habits are changing from traditional high streets.” Ayrshire traders, however, deemed it a slap in the face. But of the X from Ayr, Prestwick and Kilmarnock to Silverburn, they now admit: “Our plan is to remove this service due to very low passenger numbers.”  Stagecoach’s Ayr HQ is wanting passenger feedback on the plans and staged an information day at Ayr Town Hall on Monday. Travellers are now likely to get back their direct Ayr to Irvine number  route via Troon. The last change the company made was to introduce a A which will be scrapped. But this will only be every  minutes. The new  route will take in Barassie, Monkton and Loans. That means Loans will no longer get the  coaster which had erted through the Main Street off the A. Belmont would no longer get the number six which was every  minutes. Instead it will get the number seven every  minutes - andpassenger numbers dont improve it may also be culled. The number two will pull out of Dalmilling and Hayhill, with the areas served by the number one and three. Stagecoach want to sht the X to Hamilton from Ayr away from Prestwick and take it up Whitletts Road. The number  from Ayr to Muirkirk will lose some early and late night services due to some routes shting via the Cumnock depot. The busy X from Ayr to Glasgow is to get extra capacity. The company want new departures from Ayr at .am, .pm, .pm, .pm, .pm.

The plea comes as the John Pollock Centre, which has been described as “unfit for purpose”, is facing an uncertain future. And it is feared that the Mainholm Road facility may only have a year left before it is closed. The issue was raised at this month’s North Ayr Community Council that was attended by councillors Ian Cavana and Ian Davis and senior council officer Mark Baker. Robert Green, secretary of the community, insisted there was a desperate need for a community hub in the north of Ayr. And he asked: “Can councillors tell me about the John Pollock Centre being bulldozed ” Tory councillor Ian Davis replied: “I don’t think there is much we can say.” Mr Green added: “How can you guide the community council to get funds for a community hub  “It could be on similar lines as the new one in Maybole.” Mr Baker said a few community groups in the area had been raising the same issue. He revealed that there were a few options to consider but the council would need to engage with the community first. “We need to find out what spaces and places are available and what is required,” he added. “We need to get groups together to find what the solution is.” Mr Green said his preferred option would be to build a new facility in the existing grounds of the John Pollock Centre and that would be an ideal location for people living in Lochside, Dalmilling, Whitletts and Craigie. Labour councillor Ian Cavana said the John Pollock Centre was given a “state of execution” after council’s plans for moving local authority workers into the proposed controversial Riverside development was axed in the summer. “This time next year the John Pollock Centre would really be under pressure,” he declared. “I would love to see a new complex built to the right of the existing John Pollock Centre.” The community council heard that the John Pollock Centre is a well-used community facility for groups including line dancing, netball, keep fit, bingo and other activities. Councillor Cavana added: “It is the hub of the community. But it needs a new build. There is no definite plan just now but time is ticking. “The building is not fit for modern days.” Mr Green asked for the council’s help to access funds to build a new community hub.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartyAyrSouth Ayrshire Council"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13489965.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18066403.jpg","title":"partick thistle 0 ayr united","story":"NewsPartick Thistle , Ayr United  - Three things we learned at FirhillA Michael Rose header secured all three points for United in Glasgow as Ian McCalls men kept up their remarkable title challenge.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsMichael Roses header crosses the line to hand Ayr victory \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr Uniteds title bandwaggon kept on rolling in Glasgow as Michael Roses second half header earned a deserved three points for the visitors.

Heres three things we learned on another big afternoon for the Honest Men: Rose rises to the occasion Hes been immense for Ayr at the back this season but Michael Rose was the hero at the other end today and he climbed to power home Uniteds deserved winner. The former Aberdeen man has formed an impressive defensive partnership with Jamie Adams - and once again the pair were fantastic at Firhill. But Rose proved his threat in the opposition box when rising to bullet home Declan McDaids corner, coming as it did at the end of concerted Ayr pressure. Rose looks to have a bright future in the game and he deservedly gains the headlines today.  Whistler Bobby sends Ayr raving Madden - AGAIN It would be fair to say Ayr boss Ian McCall and ref Bobby Madden arent the greatest of pals. McCall made his feelings on the whistler well known after Ayrs trip to Ibrox earlier this season - and United were on the end of a string of hotly disputed calls here. Madden waved away two first half penalty shouts and angered Ayr with a number of other baffling calls which threatened to send the game past boiling point in the second half.  McCall wins battle of the bosses On a day when all eyes were on the Thistle dugout and Gary Caldwell making his home debut, Ian McCall made yet another triumphantto his old stomping ground. Ayrs wily gaffer made two big calls in starting Craig Moore and Declan McDaid and his men responded in style with another fine performance. McCall is not afraid of the big decisions and appears to be juggling his squad to perfection at the moment, as proven by this display where his team selection and tactics proved spot on.

shoring-up republican support for the peace process.Under the terms of the scheme names of iniduals were passed to the Government, the majority through Sinn Fein.The names were then handed to police

in , when he had been sent a letter in  stating he was free toto the UK, represented an abuse of process ndash not that the letter conferred immunity from prosecution.Mr Downey, , has always denied involvement in the  Hyde Park bomb attack by the IRA.The PSNI was heavily criticised in the wake of the judgment as an evidence report it compiled on Mr Downey, which the Government used to determine whether to issue the letter, had not stated he was being sought by the politan Police.A judge-led review of the OTR scheme ordered by then prime minister David Cameron found that it was systematically flawed in operation, but not unlawful in principle.Lady Justice Hallett said a ldquocatastrophic error had been made in the Downey case, but she insisted the letters of assurance did not amount to amnesties or get-out-of-jail-free cards.Following the probe, the PSNI undertook to review the evidence in all  applicants made under the scheme to explore whether other errors have been made.That

But we wouldnrsquot want to exclude other people who are in need.More than  people from the local area applied for the homes before they had even been advertised, but Mr Robertson was keen to point out that the need for affordable housing was not desperate.ldquoI donrsquot think therersquos a desperate need but itrsquos an expanding local authority economy, he said.ldquoTo call it a desperate demand may be slightly overstating it. There are parts of the country where you could go where there is a desperate need for social housing.ldquoThere is social housing here and therersquos a responsible housing department and good housing associations and we are working very much as part of that mix. I donrsquot think anybody is talking about things being desperate.ldquoThere is a need and itrsquos being met in a controlled and effective way.Ward councillor Neil Gilbert was also present at the handing-over of the keys and told the Courier that the development was ldquoextremely important.He said: ldquoThis is hopefully a step to a lot more of these properties being provided. The level of rent that these facilities house is what East Lothian needs.ldquoThis is a step in the right direction but letrsquos hope itrsquos a springboard for a lot more.ldquoWe need as many affordable properties as we can. When I say affordable, I mean social-rent-affordable. The more we have of those the better."},{"url":null,"title":"last-ash-lagoons-at-levenhall-to-become-a-wildlife-haven","story":"The lagoons at Levenhall Links were used to dispose of ash produced by the coal-fired power station during its letime.The power station closed in  and work has been carried out to convert the ash lagoons into areas for people to enjoy as per the Musselburgh Agreement drawn up between the local authority of the time and South of Scotland Electricity Board in .The area was taken over by ScottishPower following privatisation in .A large part of the -hectare ash lagoons has already been restored and handed over to East Lothian Council and has become a rich habitat for wildle.This month the local authorityrsquos planning committee gave the go-ahead for work to continue on the two remaining lagoons before they are also handed over.The entire site is a Scottish Wildle Trust listed wildle site, is part of the Firth of Forth Site of Special Scientic Interest and considered an important roosting site for wading birds.The area attracts bird watchers from all over the country and played host to the RSPB Big Nature Festival in  and .Councillor Willie Innes, council leader, welcomed the final part of the restoration, which will see wetlands and roosting areas created, along with footpaths and bird hides on the site.He said: ldquoThe restoration of the lagoons has been a success story, built over a number of years.ldquoIt is a valuable open space in Musselburgh and it will be great to get it completed.ldquoThere is a huge ersity in wildle which the public can access right on their doorstep."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-revealed-for-another-250-houses-on-the-edge-of-haddington","story":"An exhibition took place on October  where Taylor Wimpey East Scotland and Mactaggart  Mickel Homes outlined their proposals for a site west of Letham Mains, where work is already under way on more than  houses.The L-shaped scheme, which is off Pencaitland Road, would see about  homes created, with a quarter of them affordable, and would sit in the south-west corner of the Letham Mains plans.Paul Darling, from the townrsquos community council, was among more than  people who attended the event at the Maitlandfield House Hotel.He said: ldquoIrsquom not against them putting houses there ndash they are filling in the gap there.

The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them. I had memorised it before our visit, just in case.ldquoHowrsquod you know that  asked SuzieldquoI read about it, said Jake.Suzie was just about to say something when her dad winked at her and interrupted: ldquoWellit was a redcap then the prayer seemed to work. He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did. Jake smiled and put on his earphones.ldquoIrsquom sure it was a fox, whispered the dad to his daughter, ldquoor maybe a big rat, but just let Jake think it was a goblin.They got home with a story to tell their mum!In a quiet moment, when the children were busy, she asked the dad: ldquoSo what was it you saw He hesitated to answer the question, ashe wouldnrsquot be believed.ldquoTo be honest, I donrsquot know, he said. ldquoI told the kids it was a fox because I didnrsquot want to spook them, but I really canrsquot say.Who knows the truth of it all  If Suziersquos phone is ever found, the photos she took in the dark stairway might reveal what was really hiding in the darkness on that day."},{"url":null,"title":"be-prepared-for-next-beast-from-the-east-says-council-emergency-planner","story":"Severe weather is the biggest risk to people living in East Lothian, according to Sandy Baptie.And he has issued advice ahead of a one-day workshop to help communities prepare for any future emergencies.It includes going back to old-fashioned handsets in a time when more people rely on mobile phones.Mr Baptie, East Lothian Councilrsquos emergency planning, risk and resilience manager, has been visiting community councils and groups in the wake of the lsquoBeast from the Eastrsquo snowstorm, which brought much of the country to a standstill in February and March this year.Heavy snowfalls and strong winds caused chaos on the roads and left many people stranded in their homes.It also saw a surge in community spirit, with tales of people helping neighbours and looking after the more vulnerable people.Now Mr Baptie is hoping that spirit will help all communities prepare a Community Resilience Plan which they can use in case another severe weather front hits the county.And he has issued some advice for people to prepare in their own home for what could happen.He said: ldquoSevere weather is the biggest risk to East Lothian.ldquoBeing prepared for it is important and people can do things themselves, such as keeping an old-fashioned phone in their house in case mobile signal is lost, having a torch to hand in case power goes.ldquoIt is also important to stock up on food when warnings that severe weather is on its way are issued.More than  people are expected to attend the community resilience workshop at The Brunton, Musselburgh, on Saturday.The one-day event, which is being funded by EDF Energy and the Scottish Government, will bring together representatives from community councils, groups and schools.Advice on a range of aspects of drawing up community resilience plans will be available, including ensuring groups who take on responsibility are covered by insurance.It will also inform people of services they can sign up to with energy companies to ensure they receive a phone callpower goes out.North Berwick Community Council, which already has a plan and implemented it successfully during the Beast from the East, will be there to talk about how they did it and what worked.Mr Baptie hopes the event will result in community plans from across the county, with each one appointing a Single Person of Contact or SPOC.He said: ldquoThe idea of a SPOC is that there is one point of contact between each community and the council so we can get information to them and they can let us know what is happening, for examplepower has gone out in one area.ldquoThe plans are about drawing up lists of vulnerable people in the community, finding out who has a x and can get medicine to people or take them to hospital or the doctor.ldquoIt is about being prepared.

This is a very concerning piece of news, especially given the fact that the Tesco bus also serves the health centre.ldquoIt comes at a time when we are being told that we need to use public transport more because of dire warnings about the impact of climate change and when massive house building will lead to gridlock unless newcomers can be persuaded onto buses.Mr Turner added: ldquoEast Lothian generally, and Musselburgh in particular, is now renowned for its excellent bus services so this announcement comes as a blow and runs counter to all that has been achieved on the public transport front in the last few of years.ldquoLetrsquos hope that the council, working with the operators, can come up with a proposal to replace the extremely useful Tesco bus, and in doing so letrsquos try to serve some places that are currently remote from buses ndash Edenhall Road and the Muckletts, for example, both had buses until a few years ago and theirwould, I am sure, be welcomed by elderly residents.ldquoI think the Tesco bus should be replaced by something very similar, perhaps marketed as the Musselburgh community bus.

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

The plans, by the Aviemore and Glenmore Community Trust, include building a network of summer mountain bike trails, an Alpine bobsleigh-style coaster, an education centre, and a self-sufficient hydro electric scheme.But, most importantly, it is a way for the community to protect its livelihood amid mounting concerns over the future of the Highlands and Islands Enterprise-owned ski and snowboard resort, which has seen years of falling market share, and accusations of poor management and lack of investment.The resortrsquos prospects for this winter have been dealt a major blow with confirmation that the pound. million funicular railway, which transports visitors from car park to upper slopes, is out of action amid safety concerns for the structure.The funicular railwayrsquos foundations are being inspected by specialist engineers who are due to report on its future next month. However, by then the winter weather is expected to make signicant repair work unlikely until next spring.Concerns over the railwayrsquos future and the impact on snow sports enthusiasts who have already bought   season tickets follows the dismantling of the resortrsquos chairlts last autumn. That move sparked fury among snow sports enthusiasts and raised further questions over the management of the area at a time when rival centres appear to be flourishing.If it was to go ahead, a community buyout would dwarf other land-grab projects in terms of scale and potential financial implications.While numbers visiting Cairngorm for snow sports have fallen, with the resortrsquos market share sliding from . per cent in  to . per cent last year, a buoyant winter season of skiing and snowboarding is estimated to be worth pound million to the Speyside economy.Community buyout campaigners say questions over the funicular railway ndash essential for transporting learner skiers and snowboarders to upper levels ndash plus a surprise decision by the HIE-appointed resort operator, Cheshire-based Natural Retreats, to close its ski school operation for the season, has brought the future of the mountain to a crossroads.Aviemore and Glenmore Community Trust director Mike Dearman said: ldquoThe operatorsrsquo announcement not to operate a ski school seems to say that they have no faith in their own ability to run skiing on the mountain.ldquoPeople are worried, but in some ways it has galvanised them. We believe therersquos a positive future for Cairngorm snow sports, and some relatively small investment could move it forwards.The buyout proposals suggest AGCT could take over ownership of the land and assets from HIE, and inherit the -year lease deal with Natural Retreats. The community trust would then work with the operator to seek fresh funding streams, allowing HIE to revert to its traditional role of supporting the business and sustainable development.It suggests an pound, investment in hydro-electric schemes at Coire Cas and Coire na Ciste which would provide an income stream plus power lts and snow-making equipment.A poundm snow factory would produce cover for lower slopes, while km of mountain bike trails and a year-round Alpine coaster ndash a winding track which would carry thrillseekers down the mountainside ndash would attract summer visitors, bringing much-needed investment and seasonal work.Drew Hendry, MP for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, said he would be ldquodelighteda community buyout were to proceed.ldquoThere needs to be a change, he said. ldquoNatural Retreats has lost the confidence of local people. Communication with the public has been awful. They have shown an inability to engage properly and there has been an unacceptable sequence of events from the closing of the ski school to a lack of information of the problems affecting the funicular.ldquoI would be delighted[the buyout] was brought forward in a desirable timescale. However, we need action now and the community proposal would take some time to get together.He added: ldquoIrsquove contacted [Rural Economy Secretary] Fergus Ewing, and I am asking HIE and Natural Retreats to get around the table to sort something out. We canrsquot go through another season where we have got skiers in other resorts and not coming to Cairngorm.Kate Forbes, MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, said: ldquoThe situation with the funicular has brought things to a head and prompted a lot of concerns. The conversation over who runs the mountain has gone on for over two years. While there is a community proposal, itrsquos one thing saying the current operators are not good enough, and another to come up with an alternative.Campaigners anxious to secure the future of snow sports in the area believe the time is right for the buyout.Alan Brattey, of Aviemore Business Association, said: ldquoI have no doubt that the Cairngorm mountain business will come to local businesses and the AGCT to manage. The plans they have are substantial and will drive forward the need for radical change.Questions have been raised over whether the funicular railway can be repaired and,so, whether the repairs will enable the facility to run reliably for many years to come.Susan Smith, business development manager at HIE, defended the management of the snow sport facility.She said: ldquoItrsquos been hard for the operator in many ways because there was a signicant requirement initially to understand the mountain environment and business opportunity. Running a mountain business is tough and complex and requires signicant amount of resources to get it right. We understand the frustration of the community.Smith added that the issues affecting the funicular railway were not foreseen. ldquoThis came up under a routine inspection.

Businesses and locals who rely on it for their livelihoods are asking serious questions over how the snow sport centre is operated and its ability to continue to attract winter tourists.Concern had been already mounting over a recent slump in skier and snowboarder numbers which have seen the resort slip behind its rivals.A controversial decision last year to dismantle the mothballed Coire na Ciste and West Wall chairlts enraged mountain enthusiasts who had already expressed doubts over mountain owner Highlands and Island Enterprise and Cairngorm Mountain operator Natural Retreatsrsquo investment plans.Now technical problems affecting the funicular ndash the only route up for non-skiers and beginners ndash mean it is almost certain not to run this winter.For experienced skiers and snowboarders who do make the journey to Cairngorm, it means they are likely to face long queues for the T-bar and poma tows. Itrsquos even bleaker for beginners, who will be left kicking their boots on lower slopes prone to poor snow cover, hoping new snow-making equipment can help.Itrsquos understood a routine inspection revealed issues with floating bearings on the track which help it cope with extreme mountain temperatures. However, specialist engineers have now been brought in to inspect the railwayrsquos foundations.With the engineersrsquo report not due until early next month and the bitter winter weather expected to curb any repair programme, Natural Retreats marked the day of the first snowfall to deliver bombshell news to more than  ski school workers that their services would not be required.They join staff at the Ptarmigan Restaurant at the top of the funicular who, with no railway to feed tourists uphill, had already been told to stand down at least until the winter season kicks in. That has fuelled concerns over the operatorrsquos commitment to the resort and sparked interest among local campaigners to press ahead with plans to mount a community buyout, to develop their own vision for its future.All of which is cold comfort for local businesses facing the prospect of a bleak winter.Naeela Shahzad of Aviemore Convenience Store on Grampian Road said: ldquoIf you donrsquot get tourists up in numbers, then yoursquore in trouble.ldquoItrsquos not just skiers who use the funicular railway, some people just go up for the view. They take the funicular railway, look around and then spend time in Aviemore.ldquoPeople come to Aviemore at Christmas because they want snow. They want to go up the hill to see the views and the only way they can do that is by train. There is real concern among businesses over what will happen.Already one of Aviemorersquos most familiar names in snowsports, the Ski Shack, has closed, citing the ldquosituation on Cairngorm for its demise.Meanwhile Colin Little, manager of Mamborsquos Cafeacute Bar in the centre of Aviemore, said concern has been fuelled by confusion.ldquoNo one seems to know whatrsquos going on. Therersquos a lot of concern that it will be a dficult season, he said. ldquoThere will be tows and uplt available so wersquore all trying to stay positive.According to local MSP Kate Forbes, the situation gripping the resort is ldquopotentially devastating.ldquoThe impact of this throughout the local economy is signicant. Itrsquos snow sports that brings people to Aviemore in the winter.ldquoTherersquos no question this situation has an enormous impact on not just local hospitality and transport sectors but on the wider economy too.ldquoTo be announcing in late autumn, on the first weekend of snow, that a ski school isnrsquot going to operate, is inexplicable.ldquoEnough is enough.But just why has the former jewel in the crown of Scottish snow sport fallen so dramatically on its face To trace Cairngormrsquos problems means rewinding time to , when Aviemorersquos status as a holiday destination was taking shape in the form of a clunky concrete centre featuring go-karts, ice rink, cinema and its showpiece attraction, Santa Claus Land.The mountainrsquos ski tows and chairlts were the envy of Scotlandrsquos other resorts ndash and, indeed, many continental ski areas ndash when the Scottish Office took the controversial decision to transfer Cairngorm Estate from the Forestry Commission to HIErsquos predecessor body, the Highlands and Islands Development Board.ldquoThatrsquos where the problems began, says Dave Morris, former director of Ramblers Scotland. ldquoBoth HIDB and HIE displayed flagrant incompetency in how they dealt with the mountain. They simply chewed up one site after another, starting with Lurchers Gully and then the funicular railway.ldquoThey were told the railway was the wrong option, and a modern chairlt was a better option. But they would not listen.As well as the current engineering issues, the railwayrsquos tracks are prone to being covered by drting snow requiring staff with shovels to clear them before the trains can run.But even before its construction there were deep concerns over whether it would provide an effective alternative to a chairlt or gondola structure, and over its impact on the stony plateau of the Cairngorm mass, the only place in western Europe where both arctic and alpine habitats thrive.Its lower slopes nurture eagles, pine marten, wild cats and merlin higher up are found dotterel, snow bunting and ptarmigan.The mountain and its surroundings are designated a Special Area of Conservation, and the funicular plans horried the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ndash yet their concerns were thrown out by the Court of Session.The White Lady chairlt was torn down amid claims that the railway would see a boom in skier numbers, bringing , to the hill each year. Many locals scoffed at those figures.English-based Natural Retreats, a leisure and travel business based around eco-lodges and cottages, was appointed by Highlands and Islands Enterprise four years ago to run the centre for a -year period.If the intention was to halt any potential decline, the plan quickly fell flat.ldquoWe will build the best Terrain Park in the world here, and my long-term goal is to host the summer and winter X Games at Cairngorm Mountain, said Matthew Spence, CEO at Natural Retreats, at the time.ldquoWe will nurture, develop and create future British Olympians at Cairngorm Mountain. These athletes will win gold medals at the Winter Olympics in  and the Summer Olympics in  ndash we want to bring a true sense of pride and place to one of Scotlandrsquos most incredible assets.That, points out Aviemore and Glenmore Trust spokesman Mike Dearman, hasnrsquot quite materialised.ldquoPeople have been frustrated, these new operators came in with great promises, and then not a lot happened.ldquoThey came out with a plan for a new day lodge but it wasnrsquot well received. As far as skiers and snowboarders are concerned, they want good uplt and less queues.ldquoThen they came up with a plan for a dry slope which again wasnrsquot well received. Therersquos real frustration that their promises have not been acted upon.With Aviemorersquos reputation as the Scotlandrsquos winter playground in shreds, focus is shting towards radical solutions ndash including calls toownership of the mountain from Highlands and Islands Enterprise back to its original Forestry Commission owners, or for a community buyout.That idea emerged after horried snow sport and mountain enthusiasts witnessed the surprise removal of the Coire na Ciste and West Wall chairlts. ldquoThat cost pound, even though they could have been refurbished for less, adds Dearman.The irony of that decision is now evident. A refurbishment of the Ciste chairlt could have offered a ready-made solution to the funicular railway problems.Alan Brattey of Aviemore Business Association and owner of Avonglen self-catering accommodation said: ldquoHIErsquos long-term strategy with Cairngorm Mountain has been found out to be completely flawed.ldquoThe focus was completely concentrated on the funicular railway to the detriment of the rest of the ski area that thatrsquos been found out.ldquoHaving invested more than poundm in the funicular railway they had the view they need to get as many bums on seats to justy the cost of running it. That has been to the detriment of the rest of the infrastructure.ldquoHIE suffers from enormous institutionalised arrogance ndash it doesnrsquot listen to anyone.Meanwhile Morris points out the financial implications. ldquoCairngorm is losing market share all the time and the government is going to have to respond.ldquoItrsquos probably going to take nothing less than another poundm to sort this out.WHAT THE OWNERS AND OPERATORS SAYDespite local fury and concern for the season ahead, no-one from Natural Retreats was available to talk about the issues. A company statement said: ldquoWe welcome the investment from HIE. This new snowmaking equipment at Cairngorm Mountain will go a long way to supporting the surface lts running out of the Day Lodge area and create a learner area meaning snowsports enthusiasts can come to our resort and enjoy skiing and snowboarding.ldquoThis is great news for beginners and families who love to come to CairnGorm Mountain.Meanwhile HIE head of business development, Susan Smith, said: ldquoItrsquos fair to say that therersquos the prospect of funicular not operating during winter, but we donrsquot know what the engineering report will say.ldquoBusiness support service is being offered by Business Gateway and a Highland Council marketing campaign led by Cairngorm Business Partnership is giving a very clear message that wersquore open for business.ldquoWe know therersquos huge frustration, but health and safety is paramount.BACKGROUNDThe small Speyside village had already been on the tourist radar for decades when the first hardy skiers arrived in Aviemore.The arrival of a Victorian railway in the late s brought the tiny community its first taste of just how lucrative the emerging tourism sector could be.For the first skiers, enjoying the crisp mountain snow meant trudging uphill with skis strapped to their backs. Scotlandrsquos first ski lt in Glencoe in , was a game-changer.On  December , Cairngormrsquos White Lady chairlt, the first mechanised uplt on Cairngorm mountain and reputed to be the worldrsquos first detachable chairlt, carried its first skiers on a chilly -minute journey to the top of the hill.Hatched by a group of friends from the Glasgow shipyards, all members of the Creaghdhu Mountaineering Club, it launched Aviemore as a winter sport hub.By the mid-s, Cairngormrsquos network of chairlt, poma and T-bar tows made it one of the worldrsquos most highly developed ski areas, and Aviemore an exciting holiday destination.Lord Allander, of the House of Fraser chain of department stores, poured millions into creating a Highland playground resort.Concrete buildings in the village centre were not particularly attractive by todayrsquos standards, but were ahead of their time combining accommodation, ice rink, go-karts, swimming and Scotlandrsquos first purpose-built retail park in a single location.A generation of Scottish children grew up fascinated by Santa Claus Land. Unveiled in the mid-Seventies, it offered funfair rides, meetings with local man George Swinney, whose feathery white beard and jovial nature sent little ones home convinced they had just delivered their Christmas list to the man himself.But by the late s, Santa Claus Land ndash by then a mismatch of inflatable Father Christmas, funfair rides, a model railway and a plastic dinosaur ndash seemed to sum up an area on its knees.Concerned that jobs were at risk and the area was on a downward slide, pound.m of European money was found to prop it up.At the heart of the rejuvenation plans was to replace the White Lady chairlt with a new funicular railway that would bring income to the mountain all year around.Now, as attention focuses on Aviemores future, it once again appears that the only way to go is up."},{"url":null,"title":"arron-banks-insists-no-russian-money-and-no-interference-in-leaveeu-campaign","story":"The controversial business figure, now the subject of a National Crime Agency probe into the source of payments worth pound million, insisted all the money was legitimate and came from his UK-registered firm, Rock Services.And in an outspoken intervention Mr Banks:*hit out at the elections watchdog, the Electoral Commission, which he accused of being a biased body made up of ex-MPs from the SNP and Labour, claiming it was ldquopolitically motivated*accused the Conservative Government of ldquodisgraceful behaviour in a ldquosell-out of Brexit*described British politics as a ldquosewer, denouncing a group of ldquovicious MPs for seeking to undermine the referendum result*and even suggested it would probably have been betterBritain had voted to Remain in the EU and ldquonot unleash these demons.The investigation by the National Crime Agency was launched after the Commission said it had reasonable grounds to suspect Mr Banks was not the true source of the cash.But the controversial businessman told the BBCrsquos Andrew Marr Show: \"There was no Russian money and no interference of any type.

What tends to happen is that children start school according to their month of birth, which means that they start between the age of four-and-a-half-years-old and five-and-a-half-years-old. It does not have to be this way.There are two very dferent trains of thought about childrens readiness for school, which can be a little confusing. One is that more formal early education is good for children from deprived backgrounds who tend to be further behind in their development when they start school compared to those from more affluent backgrounds.The other argument is that some children are just not ready for school at the recommended age and that a later start would ensure that the early experience of schooling is not uncomfortable.Here, the thinking is thatthe foundations are put in place, their lives being enriched by a longer play-based early years experience, children will be able to accumulate their learning more rapidly in school when they are ready.Presently, we allow local authorities the right to determine local priorities. There is nothing wrong with this in principle, as it can be a means to allow for local needs to be met and for new and innovative practice to emerge. However, it can also lead to unevenness across the country, which is where we are at with funding extensions of early years education.Sending a child to school too early is not necessarily catastrophic because children are resilient - as long as when they eventually start school, they are supported in school in the right way for their age and stage of development. Teachers are already adept at this.Surely, decisions must be made on the basis of what is right for inidual children and therefore it would be progressivewe reached the position that parents were not penalised financially for taking a decision that was in the best interests of their child.

We need to stop before it is too late.\"Insisting that the UK should \"junk\" any solution keeping it in the EUs customs union, he said: \"Brexit was meant to be about taking back control. Under this plan we surrender control to Brussels.\"As soon as MPs understand what is really at stake, I have no doubt that they will throw this deal out.\"The leader of the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum, Eloise Todd, said: \"When the history of Brexit is written in a few years time the backstop and the UKs decisions around it will be held up as an example of how not to negotiate.\"The Government can call it whatever they want, but their plan of a unilaterally revocable backstop is dead in the water.

They have been addressed.A Whitbread spokesman said yesterday that the company is working with Highland Council to ensure \"all the relevant data and supporting information\" is made available.\"We understand the application will go before the planning committee in November,\" he said.The proposed hotel has attracted  representations from the public ndash both in favour and against.Local hoteliers and other accommodation providers claim a Premier Inn would affect trade and result in local job losses, while supporters say it would boost tourism and greatly improve the site which has been described as an eyesore.Earlier this year, Caithness Chamber of Commerce warned that the project would have \"a signicant negative impact\" on other businesses and the town centre.But retired local businessman Andy Bruce, who ran Far North Aviation at Wick airport for  years, supports the proposed development at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Caithness is \"screaming out\" for more hotel accommodation, he said.Mike Potts, chairman of Thurso Community Council, also backed the plan. \"It will utilise the site properly, provide further amenities and will tidy up an area which desperately needs it,\" he said.\"I know theres opposition from other hoteliers and accommodation providers but Premier offers a very basic service which is cost-effective and would be accessible by rail.\"However, Mr Potts said the hotel plan could \"compound the existing traffic problem\" in that part of Thurso and says planners should address this.Whitbread has applied for a three-storey hotel with landscaping and car parking.If approved, it would be the most northerly Premier Inn in the UK.The development would represent a multimillion-pound investment and create around  jobs.The site was owned by Tesco, which planned to build a new supermarket, but the project was later scrapped.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Monday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amLonghope Leboat crew had a very speedy response to a pager alert on Sunday morning when, during a pre- exercise briefing, the crew was requested to launch by the UK Coastguard.

Now in its seventh consecutive season, the Sanday Sealcam is online once again.A camera has been set up overlooking two small coves in a part of the island that is rarely visited — except by seals, otters, rabbits and birds.Set up with the kind permission of local landowners, the Towrie family, the camera is linked to a radio dish that transmits the signal, by line of sight, to a distant receiving dish, and the apparatus is powered by solar batteries — and this year for the first time, a supplementary wind-generator # at the site.Here, the live action is streamed to the internet and can be watched by anyone who logs on to the sealcam website.Sandra Towrie, Chair of Sanday Development Trust said: “Sanday Development Trust is delighted to work with Triscom as it is a hard task to stream the camera using remote, rural broadband and get high-quality live footage successfully being streamed onto the web. The Sanday sealcam allows visitors a unique opportunity to see Orkney’s amazing wildle up close and personal, and follow the highs and lows of an Orkney seal colony during pupping season from the comfort of their armchair — perfect for those unable to visit the island in person.”In recent years, Northlink Ferries have part-sponsored the Sealcam, while Sanday Development Trust continues to fund repairs, replacements and maintenance of the equipment and the time involved in camera control.Thousands of people, from all over the world, have looked at Sanday Sealcam. From the comfort of your computer-desk, or even your laptop in an armchair by the fire, the website brings you the sights and sounds of seals on an Orkney beach.

But budget leader councillor Alister Mackinnon said uncertainty would remain until the Scottish Government budget in mid-December.Cllr Mackinnon said: \"The exact gap is very uncertain as although the UK governmentrsquos budget has been announced, we will not have the Scottish Governmentrsquos budget and grant settlement figures until mid-December. We are hopeful however that the Scottish Government will pass on the additional money.\"Over the period   to   the Highland Council has already had to implement budget savings of pound. million and council tax rises of % in each of the last two years in order to deliver a balanced budget. We have managed to do this without compulsory redundancies and at the same time have still invested in important projects across the Highlands ndash such as new schools, roads and free wi-fi.\"A major concern is the councilrsquos financial reserves which are at their \"lowest levels in recent history\" requiring immediate action.\"We were estimating a pound million overspend in quarter one ndash but our officers have been working extremely hard to reduce this and we are now predicting a more positive out-turn with an overspend of pound. million,\" Cllr Mackinnon said. \"This is not ideal, but moving in the right direction. We do however have the risk of the cost of another harsh winter ahead of us.\"The council is now focusing on income generation, commercialisation and efficiencies to protect essential services.Cllr Mackinnon added: \"There will be very hard decisions to make as we plan for a reduced budget over the next three years and it is vital that we involve the public, our staff and all members in the choices we make.\"Depute budget leader councillor Matthew Reiss said: \"This is an opportunity to listen to what is important to people, to reshape our priorities and to focus our resources on improving lives.\"I strongly encourage everyone to get involved in this and make your voices heard.

She said: \"Our children are subject to appalling conditions. Only today my daughter had to sit in her classroom with her coat and hat on as it was so cold. A classroom that incorporates the staff toilet and staff room. To avoid the staff room, children are having to go in and out of the classroom via outdoors.\"Dingwall and Seaforth ward councillor Angela MacLean invited childrenrsquos minister Maree Todd and the arearsquos MSP, Kate Forbes, to support a push for funding for a replacement. Ms MacLean said: \"I think the staff do a fantastic job and it is incumbent on us to try and get a solution and all work together. Having it on the capital programme with a reduced capital budget has been dficult but everyone who has seen it knows it is badly needing replaced. Whether it be Scottish Government or Highland Council we all have to work together. Given the children that go to St Clementrsquos, it does make it more urgent because they are our most vulnerable young people.\"Mrs Todd, a Ross-shire-based Highlands and Islands MSP, declared the school not fit for purpose when she visited this year.She said shersquod be \"more than happy\" to meet local councillors but added: \"As a member of the ruling administration, Ms MacLean will know that St Clementrsquos had not previously been prioritised by Highland Council in their capital spending plans.\"Since my visit to St Clementrsquos this year Highland Council has now prioritised it. Should they require my support in making further progress, I am happy to help.\"Dingwall-based MSP Kate Forbes previously described the school \"as like something out of Oliver Twist\".She said: \"Highland Councilrsquos plans for school buildings seem to be entirely reliant on additional Scottish Government funding when it is the council who has statutory responsibility for school buildings and their annual budget settlement recognises that.\"Shesaid Highland Council had been the second highest beneficiary of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Schools for the Future funding scheme, receiving poundmillion. The next school buildings funding programme is expected by the end of the year.Renewing an appeal for progress, Ms Ferguson warned of \"promises broken and deadlines long passed\" and accused the council of breaking the law over conditions.

This will allow us to make further progress with the review of procurement policy for future ferry operating contracts.“Our ferry services are iconic transport links that play a vital role for our island economies. Making sure they continue to support the communities they serve, as well as delivering best value for taxpayer’s money, will always remain at the heart of our ferry operations.”NorthLink#s managing director Stuart Garrett said: “We are pleased to have been awarded this contract extension and we will be working closely with the Scottish government and CMAL as the ownership of the passenger vessels is transferred.“We have a positive history of working with CMAL and look forward to continuing to deliver this service with business as usual during the contract extension.”Excellent that means we can look forward to a lack of cabins and an inability to get in and out of aberdeen with any kind of weather for many years to come. This may be an excellent piece of business for the scoti government but it is bad news for us.Yes, it seems odd that, having lambasted Tavish Scott for his involvement in bringing about the use of these vessels, the SNP Scottish government has now bought them.One of the criticisms made was that the vessels# design causes them to use grossly excessive amounts of fuel, compared to other designs, e.g. Pentland Ferries catamarans.Fuel is a major component of vessel running costs so hopes of cutting costs and hence fares by improving efficiency appear to have been dashed by this move.It presumably also rules out companies like Pentland Ferries who run their Orkney-Caithness operation without subsidy, in competition with NorthLink, from entering the bidding for future contracts, which now have the look of becoming a #shoo-in# for nationalised group Cal-Mac. Very cosy.However, for users and taxpayers, that would be the worst of all possible worlds.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit.

I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Monday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace process. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27492  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaAt the start of the th century women began to campaign actively against the denial of their right to vote. In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1106582.jpg--.jpg?1540373104000\n","title":"allen s meats moves to larger premises in cullybackey","story":"AFTER  years serving the people of Ahoghill Allens Meats has moved to larger premises to meet the demands of the growing business.The butchers shop has relocated to Cullybackey to take over the former Lamont Butchers at  Main Street in the village.Allens Meats needed to acquire larger premises and decided to make the move to Cullybackey after David Lamont retired.Lamont Butchers has been based in Cullybackey since  and Derek Allen and his team will continue to provide the same excellent customer service and top quality produce.Derek said: “The business is growing and we needed more space to enable us to offer a wider range of products.“We would like to thank all our customers in Ahoghill for their support over the last  years.

Lisburn Cathedral is where the seeds of faith were sown and where I felt the first call to ordination.”After A Levels, Mark joined the Northern Ireland Civil Service where he worked for more than seven years, ending up in IDB House where his job was to encourage exports from Northern Ireland overseas.In his mid-s, Mark felt a strong calling to commit more to his faith.He said: “I didn’t see ordination as the way forward but wanted to know more about faith and Christian service.This led him to Oakhill College in north London.He continued: “The structure allowed people to find their direction within the studies.“This could have been anything from youth ministry to army chaplaincy or evangelism.”It was during his three years at Oakhill Mark decided ordination was for him. Halfway through the course, he began contacting bishops.“St Alban’s Diocese took me under their wing. They accepted me for ordination training in the Church of England.“God opened doors for me.”.After graduation from Oakhill, Mark had the opportunity to do a familiarisation year on his way to ordination, and he did this at St James’ Parish, Muswell Hill, north London, where he had the opportunity to do anything that needed doing!During that year he married Cherith, a native of Omagh and a primary school teacher.Mark was ordained in St Alban’s Diocese and served his first curacy in Christ Church, Bedford.He and Cherith felt called back to Northern Ireland, and Mark became accustomed to the ways of the Church of Ireland through a second curacy in Bangor Parish, Diocese of Down and Dromore. During this time he did a lot of work with the congregation of The Primacy, a small church on a large housing estate shared with the Methodist Church.Mark was later appointed rector of Killyleagh in Co Down, and after seven years moved to Connor Diocese as rector of Ballyclare.He remained in Ballyclare for more than  years before the move to Ballymena, where he currently ministers along with his we Cherith and their three children, Daniel, Matthew and Erin.A date for his installation to the Chapter of St Saviour has yet to be set, but Rev McConnell will continue to be rector of the Ballymena Parish while a Canon of Lisburn Cathedral.

A founding member of the Ballymurphy Massacre campaign and member of Relatives for Justice, Carmel will ask for American support for the campaign at public events and Congressional meetings. MPs have called for an end of former British troopers being “hounded and pursued” by murder investigations, while Theresa May praised the “heroism” of British crown forces who “upheld the law”. RFJ believes that while not specically referring to Ballymurphy, such claims may impact an inquest considering whether British forces upheld the rule of law in the case.AOH Freedom for All Ireland Chair Martin Galvin said: “The Ballymurphy Massacre is a fundamental test of Britain#s ability to give legacy justice. If victims cannot get justice where  people, including a Catholic priest and mother of eight children were killed by British troops, how can we expect justice in any killings or collusion murders where British forces were involved AOH National Vice-President Danny O#Connell and National Secretary Jere Cole recently promised the Ballymurphy families that America would stand behind them in their battle for justice.

The De La Salle student will travel to London on Friday and fly out to St Petersburg on Saturday. The preliminaries for the rd FIG Trampoline Gymnastics World Championships take place Wednesday, November  with the finals taking place two days later on Friday, November .Devine came out on top of a high-class field in the senior men’s DMT competition in Birmingham at the end of September to win his first British title and secure his place in the World Championships. His coach, Simon Flannery, was delighted with his performance in Birmingham and is hoping some adjustments to his routines will yield a further improvement in Russia next week. “Each competitor completes two routines and the top eight go through to the final,” stated Flannery.“The routines he did in the preliminaries for the British Championships are the routines he will now in the prelims in Russia. “Those routines would have placed him second in the prelims for last year. “We know he is in around the area he needs to be to make it to the final. “He was brilliant in Birmingham. He had a tough build-up to the Championships. The routines we wanted to do at the Championships weren’t quite there yet, so we had to make a decision not to compete with those. It paid off because he done a modied last routine and he done it really well and won.”He added: “Since then, we have upgraded those routines and he is looking phenomenal. He had a training camp last week with the GB team and he smashed all his classes. “In our sport, it comes down to tenths of points, so every step you take, or wobble, or bend of the arms can cost you. “Every tenth you lose is tripled because the three judges scores are counted.“The last training camp is about fine-tuning the little details to maximise your score.”As British champion, Devine will have high hopes of continuing his rapid rise in the sport by securing a medal. Flannery believes Devine has the ability to progress to next Friday’s finals and is hopeful of another fine showing from the West Belfast prospect. “He is hoping to get into the finals, which is the main thing,” said Flannery.“I think his routines will easily put him into the top five. “We’d love to come away with a medal.“He is excited and a little bit nervous, but he turns that into a real positive. He gets adrenaline from it.” Flannery, who recently relocated Andersonstown Trampoline Club to Mallusk to merge with Flight Gymnastics, also revealed that Devine will be targeting Olympic qualication in the New Year. The -year-old will have a well-earned break from competition after the World Championships in Russia before embarking on a two-year goal to qualy for Tokyo in . “We have got a break after Russia then, next year, the qualication starts for the Olympic Games ,” added the Flight Gymnastic coach. “It starts in February and he has to compete in a run of events over the next two years. Only the top  men and the top  women make the Olympics. “We are working very hard to get him into the top  so he can qualy for the Olympics.“If you take out the Russians and the Chinese, then a lot of dferent counties can make up that top . It comes down to whoever is the most consistent during the qualication events. “He has shown this year that he is very consistent in the top competitions so hopefully he can get a spot.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-02-at-09.52.44.png","title":"last chance to cast your vote for our inspirational youth","story":"WITH just hours to go until voting comes to a close for the Inspirational Youth of the West awards, rest assured – there is still time to cast your vote.With over , online votes so far counted across  categories, our youth and their sterling work and endeavours will be honoured on Friday, November  at the Devenish Complex for the gala congratulatory evening hosted by Pamela Ballantine.

On that day I posted a blog on Eamonn Mallies website challenging both of you to sort out your dferences and to get back into Government..pushI have been encouraged by the response to the blog from right across Northern Ireland, the Republic and GB and I now want to personally challenge you to do the right thing, to show some of the courage that your predecessors demonstrated and end this stalemate. McBrides debate challenge to Northern Ireland leaders I have no interest in the blame game as I believe it to be disruptive and unproductive. The real issue keeping the DUP and Sinn Fein from sharing power is attitude. With the right attitude nothing is insurmountable.In my blog I cited an example of when I moved into a mixed area from a Loyalist housing estate. It was about two years after the bomb and the move was prompted by a desire for my daughter to get to know little Catholic girls.It worked as she became best friends with two sisters that lived across the street. One Eleventh Night as I was getting ready to go round the bonfires in my old area, their parents called over and invited me to a barbecue at their house. I accepted the invitation and called over before going round the fires.What happened next has stayed with me for a long time and has served as a reminder of the kind of Northern Ireland I want to live in. When I arrived at their house they had built a small bonfire in their back garden, just for me.There were no flags on this fire and no effigy to be burned. I sat around the fire, drinking beer and eating a burger. We talked about everything and anything as our kids laughed and played together in the garden. Later on as I stood watching another Irish Tricolour burn on another Loyalist bonfire I thought about what had just happened in my Catholic neighbours house and wondered why it couldnt be like that all the time.Thats the kind of Northern Ireland I voted for in  and its still the kind of Northern Ireland I want to be part of in . But I need you guys to make it happen and you canyou show genuine leadership instead of entrenched opposition.I want both of you to tell those of us who have to live together in this small place what does it mean to be a good neighbour in this society.What could you do for the other that would make them feel welcome and their culture and traditions valued  How much is good neighbourliness a factor in your thinking This is the challenge that I want you to meet - for me, for the people of the Shankill, the people of Greysteel and for people all over Northern Ireland.I challenge both of you to a live debate with me on the issue of being a good neighbour. There is no need to bring a facilitator in from amongst the great and the good, just a live televised interview with an ordinary guy who lost his we in a bomb.I want to hear you explain to the people of Northern Ireland what you are prepared to do to make this country work, in what way will you be a good neighbour. I dont need you to rehash the problems that you face as most of the country is weary with that debate. I need to see how youre going to fix it and when, and I think that will only start when we hear for ourselves that you accept each other as good neighbour."},{"url":null,"title":"tribunal rules psni owes 30m in outstanding","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It ies at dferent times of the year and in response to dferent political climates.”Lead solicitor on the case, John McShane, of McCartan Turkington Breen , represented nine of the  police officers, for whom the Chief Constable George Hamilton is answerable, and two civilian staff claimants, for whom the Police Authority is answerable.Landmark ruling: John McShane He said: “The Chief Constable’s failure — and continued failure to date — to pay staff in accordance with the legal requirements resulted in the need for police and civilian staff to incur the cost of pursuing legal proceedings to seek redress for their lawful entitlement to be properly paid whilst on annual leave.”Mr McShane explained that PSNI holiday pay had been based on working basic contracted hours and hadn’t accounted for any additional hours required.A high profile case in Great Britain four years ago, however, had determined that pay whilst on annual leave should include an average of overtime and other allowances.“Cases were pursued here because the PSNI had not sought to comply with these legal obligations,” he said. “The cases also addressed to what extent arrears of these unlawful deductions of wages, backdated to , could be claimed.“In England and Wales, legislation was introduced to limit any arrears claim to two years. No such equivalent legislation was passed by the Northern Ireland Assembly.”Mr McShane pointed to Judge Kelly’s ruling that “a failure to provide the right to paidannual leave... is an extremely serious matter going to the heart of one of the fundamental rights of the European Union.”Mark LindsayThe employment judge added: “An employer is not allowed to sidestep or to avoid the rights guaranteed under a European community directive. In the present claims, the position has been clear to all parties since .“Overtime payments and allowances should have been included, on some basis within the calculation of holiday pay.“The present claims appear to highlight a situation where a clear entitlement under the Working Time Directive hasbeen effectively ignored and avoided for a signicant period of time and continues to be avoided. It is particularly concerning that this has been done by a public authority.”Mark Lindsay, chair of the Police Federation for Northern Ireland, praised the ruling saying it “corrects a long-running disadvantage and delivers signicant back payments to officers”.“The Police Federation represented , officers at no cost to themselves,” he said.“A further  were engaged in a private action which they had to fund. The cost to the PFNI was over £,.“Legal counsel was shared with the other officers who pursued the private action.”Mr Lindsay said the ruling “will give officers what they are entitled to” and he called on government “to step in to meet the claim rather than allow it to become a burden on the existing financial allocation”.“The federation is aware of the financial implications of the ruling,” he added.“Paying what officers are due should not be allowed to adversely impact on the PSNI budget which is already under strain.”Deputy Chief Constable Stephen Martin said: “We are considering the findings of this legal judgment which is complex and signicant. We continue to be involved in the legal process and as such it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch how to avoid ryanairs new baggage rules passenger sews all his belongings into coat for belfast flight","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Its always on time, it runs like clockwork. But these latest changes, theyre too much,\" he says.Last week budget airline Ryanair announced it would change its hand luggage rules for the second time this year.Since Thursday, November , passengers are only permitted to travel with one small bag free of charge. Customers flying with a small kg suitcase are now being charged - something the airline says is necessary to reduce delays.In January, Ryanair had already introduced a policy which saw passengers who had bought priority boarding permitted to take a “personal bag” – such as a handbag – on board along with a second, larger bag – such as a wheelie suitcase weighing up to kg.Ryanair changes luggage rules for second time in a yearIn the video Lee says he and his friend had booked a flight to Belfast for his birthday, only to find out two days later the new charges had been introduced.Speaking to the Belfast , Lee said he was surprised by how much attention his video has gained.\"I didnt expect anything like this,\" he said.\"I travel regularly, always using Ryanair, so I am quite clued up on the baggage allowance.\"This particular trip the baggage rule changed a couple of days before we did it.\"I thought: I am only going for a night in Belfast, lets see how we can get round that. So I decided to take all my luggage inside my coat. I met a nice tailor, and they agreed to make some pockets in my coat.

Brexit negotiations are now at a critical stage with all focused on reaching agreement.”He also highlighted the Government’s plans to hold a referendum next year on a proposal to allow Irish citizens living outside the Republic the right to vote in future Presidential elections.Two similar letters have been penned to the Taoiseach in the last  months, one from a number of nationalists based in Northern Ireland and one from nationalists residing south of the border.Brexit threatens to deepen the rights crisis and there is a real danger of serious erosion of current guaranteesLetterFacebookTwitterThe latest, which was sent on Friday and published in the Irish News on Monday as a two-page advert, has the largest number of signatures and is an all-island endeavour.The letter welcomes Mr Varadkar’s pledge to defend the interests of Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland through the Brexit process but blames the Stormont powersharing impasse, which has seen the region without devolved government for almost two years, for “denying” certain “rights” to people north of the border.It highlights Democratic Unionist opposition to same sex marriage and an Irish Language Act as two key issues of concern.The letter adds: “As you know these rights are now taken for granted by citizens in other parts of these islands.“The British Conservative government has rendered itself unable to effect any progress on these rights issues due to its dependence on the DUP.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Footballer James McClean is among the signatories “Brexit threatens to deepen the rights crisis and there is a real danger of serious erosion of current guarantees.”On Brexit, the letter raises concerns about access to free healthcare in EU countries a potential hike to the cost of attending university in the Irish Republic and the fact Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland will no longer be represented in the European Parliament.The letter continues: “There is a very real potential that partition could be reinforced, and our country and our people further ided.“This is a source of grave concern to all of us.“We, as Irish citizens, urge you to adhere to your commitment that we would ‘never again be left behind by an Irish Government’ and to redouble your efforts, and the efforts of your government, to ensure that our rights are protected.”Plans for the latest letter were first reported last month by the Co Fermanagh-based newspaper, the Impartial Reporter, which interviewed Enniskillen born actor McMenamin about his rationale for signing it.He told the paper he was concerned that the imposition of a hard border post-Brexit could spark violence.“Brexit and a border causing violence is a possibility and one that should never be overlooked but Brexit and a border causing economic chaos is a fact and one that is being totally overlooked by the DUP,” he said.“It won’t make anyone more British, it will just make everyone poorer.”Belfast lawyer Niall Murphy, who has been involved in compiling the letter, said every section of nationalist civic le was represented among the signatories.“That this letter is signed by over a thousand leaders from the nationalist community is a testament to an evolving earthquake in terms of an awakening of nationalist confidence,” he said.“The , names are symbolic, the letter is not a petition, but a representative sample of the views of hundreds of thousands of people across the north and indeed across the entire island.”"},{"url":null,"title":"major political controversy over on the run scheme","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr O’Brien, who resigned in May as head of the HSE over the cancer controversy, claimed Mr Harris was obsessed with media coverage and also attacked politicians who probed the issue. In a move to defend his Cabinet minister, Mr Varadkar said: “The past six months alone, he brought through the referendum to repeal the Eighth amendment and at long last has enacted the public health alcohol bill – legislation that is going to save a lot of lives.“Those are two pretty big achievements by a Health Minister in six months.

This is particularly worrying as I remain unconvinced that the current site can accommodate an extra  or  students, without this having a detrimental effect on their wellbeing and the quality of teaching.ldquoI also have signicant concerns about the impact the single site option would have on traffic in the Saul Road area, given the congestion issues and poor infrastructure already in the town.He said he was ldquoworried about the impact that moving teachers and pupils, which he argued would be inevitable in the transitional phase, would have on timetabling.Cllr Brown said he was ldquoslightly more enthusiastic about a two-school option, though he claimed there was ldquostill a lack of clarity from CCMS about how this would work in practice.He added: ldquoI hope the CCMS can produce more detail on this during the post-consultation stage. Officials have informed us that they hope to implement this amalgamation as early as September .ldquoIf that is the case, much work needs to be done to assuage the concerns of parents, secure long term capital funding mdash and potentially a new site mdash and ensure the inevitable challenges occurring during the transitional period do not become permanent fixtures of any new school.Mr Lyttle said that while Alliance was strongly opposed to academic selection and believed in the need for integration and rationalisation of schools across the province, ldquothese changes must always be made while putting the wellbeing and educational outcomes of children first.He added: ldquoThere does appear to be practical concerns with this proposal, particularly regarding implementation which will need to be addressedany amalgamation is to be delivered in a way that will benefit all pupils.ldquoIt is vital that the concerns of parents and other stakeholders are considered and the change management process is handled in a way which delivers for everyone in the community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Annsborough school forms community forum group  ","story":"A NEW community engagement forum has been launched at Annsborough Integrated Primary School.This exciting new development will involve parents, governors, staff and past pupils working with officers from the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education, supported by investment from the Integrated Education Fund.Speaking at the launch last Thursday, Lynda Brown, school principal, said she was pleased at the investment and support being offered by NICIE and the IEF.ldquoThere is a great buzz in the school tonight and itrsquos lovely to see so many parents, governors and families attending from within our local community, she remarked.Ms Brown welcomed Tina Merron, Chief Executive Officer of the IEF, Roisin Marshall, CEO of NICIE, and Denise Morgan, Senior Development Officer with NICIE.She said the school community looked forward to working with them to build on the Integrated education being offered at Annsborough IPS.ldquoWe are keen to work with our local community to ensure that integrated provision is available for all who desire it in future, she added.Ms Marshall said she was ldquodelighted to be at the school to discuss the future growth of integrated education in the area.She remarked: ldquoItrsquos always really nice to get the chance to meet people who are committed to working together for their local communities to ensure that children and adults can have opportunities to work together under one roof mdash Protestant,Catholic, other faiths and none.

Little was seen of Ards attack in the first half, but with  minutes gone Nathan McShane had to be alert to head an in-swinging corner from Brian Cabraley off the line.McGrady, Branagan and Telford continued to give the Ards defence plenty to think about and with  minutes gone Downpatrick made it -. Branagan worked his way into a good position on the right and fired over a tempting cross that flew into the top left hand corner of the net, giving the visiting goalkeeper no chance.Downpatrick went in at the break, worthy of their three-goal advantage, but they were unable to kick on from there in the second half.Ards were the more aggressive after the break and Downpatrick were put under a certain amount of pressure, but Anthony Doherty, Conor Moore, Nathan McShane and Caolan Logue all defended superbly and provided resolute cover to captain Kieran Gordon in goal.Gordon was only beaten once and that was in the th minute when McCleary tucked away a cross from Dunlop in a clever move.Ards continued to push and probe, but a hard-working Downpatrick side refused to give way and thoroughly deserved their first three points of the season.Downpatrick FC: K Gordon, C Logue, N McShane, C Moore, A Doherty, J Branagan, C McGrady, Adrian McCoubrey, M McGarritty, Andrew McCoubrey, P Telford.

It took us about a week to show him how.After an initial assessment, each seal began their journey to rehabilitation receiving extensive medical care, to ensure infections were kept at bay and housed in hospital pen whilst learning how to eat fish.Once they reached about kg and could self-feed, they were moved to the outdoor pools where they learnt how to socialise with other seals.At this stage, all human contact was kept to a minimum to ensure a successful re-introduction to the sea.Two days before their release, the seals were discharged from the seal unit as they had successfully reached their target weight of over kg and were in good health, ready to take on adult le in the wild.Ms Robinson said that Knockinelder Cove provides a great area for the pupsrsquo first few hours to get used to having no walls as they swim.ldquoWe never release a seal on its own and through our weekly weigh-in, we can identy release lsquoteamsrsquo such as Loki, Freya and Juno being our first for this season, she added.Ahead of the release all seals are tagged on their rear flipper to help identy them.Over time this will be used to see how rehabbed seals influence the wild population through breeding.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world.

If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Inside the bell are the remains of an iron ‘clapper’ which struck the side to make the bell sound, but as it has corroded the bell is now silent. The new display has been made possible through a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, which has also enabled a community engagement programme around the item of shared heritage to take place.Dr Greer Ramsey, curator of archaeology at National Museums NI, explained the bell’s signicance, saying: “Along with religious books and the hooked staff or crozier carried by a bishop, bells became potent symbols of the Christian faith and even feature on stone carvings from this period.“Many hand bells were reputed to have connections to early saints so it was common for people to believe bells like this had miraculous powers.”To mark the recent discovery and display of the Ballyclog bell, there will be a special event at the Ulster Museum on November .Entitled, ‘Early Christian Ireland: Hand Bells, High Crosses, Music and More’, a series of talks will look at le in early Christian Ireland, at the use of church hand bells and at the identity of a mysterious musical instrument.

In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community. I look forward to coming home.To find out more about Bayscape, visit www.bayscape , call    or email info@bayscape. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

Belfast City Council’s planning committee approved Primark’s listed building consent application for the Bank Buildings. It means the conservation-led works to take down the top two floors of Bank Buildings can now begin. “Once these unstable elements are removed, works can take place to install a facade retention scheme,” the council said. “It will also make it possible to reduce the cordon and restore pedestrian access between Royal Avenue and Donegall Place, subject to health and safety considerations as work takes place.” It also means Primark will be able to open up once again, at the building’s new extension. Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium , said: \"This is terric news for Primark and for the retail hub of Belfast City Centre. Now that planning has been granted they can start the work to bring down the facade and put up the protection that will allow the cordon to reduce and for stores within the cordon to open. “This will be a le line for those traders in the cordon and those without who have seen their footfall drop by over %. We also welcome the news that Primark will open again soon as it will serve as a footfall draw to this part of the city which has been devastated. We now look the Chancellor and his budget next week to seecentral government will step up to support the city centre.” The latest footfall figures from the NIRC showed footfall across the city was down by more than % in September.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"donegall house on sale for m","story":"Posted on Thursday November  by Ulster Business A prominent Belfast building has gone on the market for offers over £.m, it can be revealed.Donegall House, which sits across from City Hall on Donegall Square, is now being marketed by Osborne King and CBRE.Built in , the building was refurbished in .

Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
