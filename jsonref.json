Tom Jenkins has been taking an enforced break from action photography and pursuing a different kind of vision in his gardenI have never appreciated my back garden so much.At this time of year, I’m usually caught up with all the to-ings and fro-ings of the sporting world: taking photos of traditional spring events like the Boat Race and Grand National, or key matches as the football season builds to a crescendo. Normally I’m away a lot, not really passing an eye over developments in my garden. But this is not a normal year.It was mid-March, and I was sitting despondently in my tiny postage stamp of a garden. The previous week I had photographed the Cheltenham festival, an event I associate with the end of winter, spring coming, the light getting better. A chance to look ahead to a summer of sport, going to events that I love. But this year, the festival had felt all wrong – more like a dangerous party on the eve of war. It seemed all around me the news was harrowing, and sport was getting hammered as event after event was cancelled. My world had suddenly been turned upside-down.I realised then that I had to reframe and refocus. With all my normal avenues for taking pictures closed off, I needed to find something else. I recalled the words of Ed Jackson, a former professional rugby player whose portrait I had taken exactly a year earlier. After suffering an awful accident that had left him partially paralysed, he had developed a mental process to cope with his new situation: focus on what’s in front of you, focus on things you can affect, and try to forget what’s out of your control.Remembering this, I looked round the edge of the tiny piece of lawn and noticed some tulip bulbs that my wife had planted in terracotta pots. Lush green leaves with buds full of promise had emerged from the soil, ready to bloom. In these plants, I saw hope. I saw normality.It occurred to me then that this process of growth and positivity deserved to be documented. Despite the global madness, nature was thriving – and these tulips seemed to be begging me to tell their story. To me, photography is more than just a career: it is my passion, and in these flowers I found the perfect opportunity to take pictures without leaving my home.To test myself, I decided not to use any of my main professional cameras. These are more used to the hurly-burly of sport, all fast focusing and speedy motor-drive. Instead, I turned to what I call my “holiday camera”, an upmarket point-and-shoot that I take away on trips with the family (the last thing I want on holiday is to be surrounded by items associated with work, many of which are heavy). Light, easy to manoeuvre around the plants, and – most crucially – able to focus close-up, this small camera actually turned out to be perfect for this project.As the sun moved round the garden during the day, backgrounds became dark and shadows on the flowers created gorgeous patterns. I would note which times were best to photograph certain plants, and would periodically drop whichever household task I was doing (much to the irritation of my family) to race to the garden and catch the flowers in the perfect light.Like all photographers, I look to light as another tool in the box, an opportunity to create something different. By varying angles, I could make petals look like paper, tightly bunched flower heads look like lips. Going in tight, I attempted to show the beauty of the flowers in a surreal way. The warm spring sunshine of the last few weeks had not only ushered the tulips into full bloom but enhanced their colour and vibrancy, so some of my photographs gained an almost unearthly quality.I’ve never felt so lucky to have my garden, this tiny oasis in densely crowded north London. In the land of quarantine, my house has never felt more like a castle, defending me from the warzone outside the front gate. In that castle, my garden is the green inner sanctum, a place of peace and tranquillity.As I sit here now, in the sunshine, I hear birdsong and the rustling of leaves, with the chirruping of children playing wafting in on the breeze. The sky above my head is free from planes and pollution and a brilliant blue. The sun, bright and sharp at this time of year, makes everything look crisp. In times like these, we remember that nature truly is life-affirming, and the simple act of flowers growing means so much. It shows that in an abnormal world, normality is king."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e94755d109e43c77a70533def7b5dcd3392fe84b/0_118_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4103b72dfef04f07d96eafc4719ae38b","title":"apocalyptic vision the unsettling beauty of lockdown britain is pure sci fi coronavirus","story":"The streets lie silent, the skies are clear, as office buildings reflect our empty cities. Coronavirus has brought with it the same eerie scenes that have long haunted the modern imagination The end of everything we took for normal has a dire aesthetic fascination. The streets lie silent and still under unnaturally clean skies. A lone walker stares into a deserted bookshop. Office buildings, once vulgar, fulfil their true potential as sets for a sci-fi nightmare, glassily reflecting the empty city. While I do not want to in any way downplay the tragedy that has left thousands dead and will kill thousands more, there has been one eerie byproduct: the apocalyptic beauty of lockdown Britain.Take a walk through quiet streets for your daily exercise and you come across vistas sci-fi has spent more than a century preparing us for. A main road so still you can stand in the middle of it, among the squatting pigeons. A row of expensive shops all closed and dark midweek. Such scenes of The End have haunted the modern imagination since HG Wells described the abandoned streets of the imperial metropolis and devastated Surrey in The War of the Worlds. We’ve all absorbed these visions of apocalyptic Britain, generation after generation, from the 1970s TV chiller Survivors to Danny Boyle’s uncannily convincing dawn photography of an emptied landscape in the film 28 Days Later. Surely we can be forgiven a frisson of macabre awe at seeing all these fantasies become real.It might be healthier to embrace the nightmare than pretend we’re in a cosy new normal. I’m not too sure about “lockdown culture”. It’s all so positive and mutually supportive. Let’s bake, exercise and singalong. But imagination is black-hearted and feeds on shadows. Positivity is the opposite of sensitivity. The 18th-century aesthetician Edmund Burke looked honestly into his own soul and confessed that, for all the seductions of pretty things, he was more truly drawn to disturbing sights – a pitch-black night, a cliff face, a storm at sea. Burke called their aesthetic appeal “sublime”. Tell an audience gathered to watch a play that a public hanging is about to happen down the road, he says, and the theatre will empty.A normally bustling city or town that has been reduced to ghostly calm is a startling instance of the sublime. And a new one. For all the gleeful shudders of sci-fi, no previous generation has ever quite experienced this before. Writers imagined it and film-makers strived to visualise it – but no one has actually woken up in a modern world that has come to such a disturbing standstill.“When a day that you happen to know is Wednesday starts off by sounding like Sunday,” wrote John Wyndham in The Day of the Triffids, “there is something seriously wrong somewhere.” For weeks now, every Wednesday has sounded like a Sunday – and so have all the other days. When life outdoes art, we should allow ourselves to embrace the spectacle.For right now we’re surrounded by the sublime, and the disaster outside is much more powerful than the ersatz culture indoors. While art is reduced to virtual reassurances, a walk to the shops is a horribly unforgettable scene of a world turned upside down. My local shopping centre happens to be located in a classic example of 1960s futuristic architecture, with concrete towers facing the sun above a concrete piazza. Its time has come. It’s just a shame JG Ballard isn’t around to see the spaced-out queue for Waitrose on a Saturday morning. “The last members of the middle class fortifying themselves against society’s collapse with a final fix of quinoa,” he might have said. As I join the queue, I know I will remember this grotesque moment of pandemic life when I’ve forgotten every online art exhibition.The latest news images reveal a further surrealism: the lockdown in decay. More and bigger queues, as DIY superstores reopen. It’s rumoured garden centres will be next. As Ballard would say, the middle class must have its illusions even in the apocalypse. In truth, looking at images of gathering crowds, I feel a pang of loss. At least the early days of the lockdown were absolute. At least they were sublime.You can still find the sudden silence in the heart of the city. There are moments when no other walkers are about, no cars come by, and empty workplaces tower above in brutalist disregard. It’s worth seeking out such ground zeros of total lockdown. In the centre of the city in the day, you can appreciate the terrible beauty of the day the earth stood still. At least it will be something to remember in the sad convalescent years ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad999f8d39c50689bd4246a37a421a12a6bfb0d0/0_231_2685_1611/master/2685.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=249045b6f0c2155be1ce778b8e584916","title":"2020 gdt nature photographer of the year","story":"The German Society for Nature Photography (GDT) has selected its Nature Photographer of the Year 2020.The winning image is part of a series of photographs taken in Dortmund’s north by Peter Lindel.

More than 40 responded, their story opening with a group of scientists trying to find a cure for a virus that has caused a global pandemic.“For us, writers, it is normal and it may even be a good condition to be closed and focused to write our books. But when we are compelled to do so, when we find ourselves under a catastrophe of such an overwhelming scale, I think that what could be an ideal time to write turns into extremely suffocating conditions,” said De Carvalho. “So, instead of dedicating myself to my own book and making a quarantine diary, describing trips around my room as Xavier de Maistre, I thought it might be more interesting to break the walls around us through literature, and bypass the social isolation.”The writers, who include the acclaimed authors Gabriela Ruivo Trindade, Afonso Reis Cabral and Nara Vidal, are committed to publishing a new chapter every day at noon. The series is to end with a chapter from Camilo Castelo Branco prize winner Luísa Costa Gomes.“For us, simply making trenches of our sofas was not enough,” say the writers in a collective statement. “In spite of the current apocalypse, we want to demonstrate that we’re still here, in contact with the public. We work without a safety net, with no time for editing, revision, reflection … For now, we wish to offer an escape into inspiration. And one day, as soon as this pandemic is over, go back to inspiring freely. When the world reopens, we will be here to receive you with open arms.”Known as Bode Inspiratório – a spin on the Portuguese term for a scapegoat – the project is now spreading internationally, with translations into Italian, French, Spanish, Dutch and now English, by a group of leading translators including Margaret Jull Costa, Danny Hahn and Frank Wynne.Translator Victor Meadowcroft said the project was drawing a huge amount of public interest in Portugal, where the writers are nearing the end of the story, and where the tale has gained almost 15,500 followers on Facebook in a month. The English version, Escape Goat, has been published in daily instalments since 13 April and is up to chapter 16.“Each author takes a fresh approach to the themes and characters of this story, and one of the things I have found most striking is the way the daily fears and concerns of each inidual filter into their texts, creating a fascinating document of life under lockdown,” said Meadowcroft, who assembled the team of English translators.Recent chapters have featured an android called Reboredo, whose only function is to spread fear among the housebound population, while the virus has mutated to leave its victims highly sensitive to sunlight.Artists are also creating pieces to appear alongside the chapters. “In these dark times, it seems to me that collaborative projects like this one are a way for us to connect and come together,” said Meadowcroft. “The fact that 46 translators and a handful of editors have given up their time, with no prospect of remuneration, to help bring across this inspiring project from Portugal is a shining example of this lockdown spirit.”“Portugal, despite having a language spoken by many millions on all continents, has a somewhat insular literature,” said De Carvalho, who welcomed the translations. “It is very difficult to break the borders of the cultural confinement that surrounds us. That is why we were very happy to learn that the Anglo-Saxon world can read us, get to know us, may have, after all, a small sample of contemporary Portuguese literature and contemporary art.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7bfa9746a2c50766c336b277c936779d101433d/0_15_1920_1153/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d0d0ced83dfd042bd9f906b6c626a29","title":"british airways plans to make up to 12000 staff redundant","story":"BA boss says more than one in four jobs could go as coronavirus causes global collapse in air travelBritish Airways has set out plans to make up to 12,000 of its staff redundant because of the global collapse in air travel in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.The airline’s chief executive, Alex Cruz, told BA’s 42,000 staff on Tuesday night that the company “must act decisively now to ensure that British Airways has a strong future” and that means more than one in four jobs must be cut.Cruz said the UK’s flag carrier airline, which has placed 22,600 people on the government’s furlough scheme, “cannot expect the taxpayer to offset salaries indefinitely”.“Yesterday, British Airways flew just a handful of aircraft out of Heathrow. On a normal day we would fly more than 300. What we are facing as an airline, like so many other businesses up and down the country, is that there is no ‘normal’ any longer,” Cruz said in a letter to staff .“We are a strong, well-managed business that has faced into, and overcome, many crises in our hundred-year history. We must overcome this crisis ourselves, too.”Cruz said the airline and its parent company International Airlines Group, had informed the government and its trade unions about its plans to cut jobs, and would begin a consultation period with staff and unions immediately.“This has been a difficult message to write and one I never thought I would need to send,” Cruz said.“I know how tight-knit the BA family is, and how concerned you will be, not just for yourself but for your colleagues, too. We must act decisively now to ensure that British Airways has a strong future and continues connecting Britain with the world.”IAG said it had plunged to a loss of €535m (£465m) in the first three months of this year – with all the damage being done in March. In the same period last year the airline group made a profit of €135m. IAG also revealed it had made a one-off loss of €1.3bn – the result of taking out contracts to hedge against the possibility of rising oil prices. In fact the oil price has crashed.IAG said BA had been hit hardest, with other airlines in the group – Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling – feeling less impact.Unions responded with anger. Brian Strutton, the general secretary of the pilots’ union Balpa, said staff were devastated by the “bolt out of the blue” news and that the union would fight for every job.“BA pilots and all staff are devastated by the announcement of up to 12,000 possible job losses in British Airways,” he said.BA, he added, had “said it was wealthy enough to weather the Covid storm and declined any government support.”The leader of the Unite union described BA’s decision as heartless, and a “stab in the back”, saying it was “entirely at odds with the course of action followed by our European competitors as they seek a way through the coronavirus crisis”.Len McCluskey said: “To reject government support but then expect their own staff to pay the cost of such a misjudgement, is irresponsible, dangerous and destructive and is utterly at odds with the mood of the country at a time of crisis.”Nadine Houghton, national officer of GMB, the union for British Airways ground staff, said: “If the 12,000 figure is accurate this will be a huge blow for our loyal members.“I know our reps will work day and night to limit the impact on our members but 12,000 employees is a staggering number. All our efforts will be out into bringing that number down.”The airline industry is facing its biggest ever challenge with the vast majority of flights grounded around the world. It is unclear when governments will allow airlines to resume a regular schedule.When planes do take to the skies again social distancing measures – which are likely to limit the density of passengers onboard – will make it hard for airlines to make the same profits as before.The global airlines trade association, Iata, has predicted that airlines could lose more than $300bn (£240bn) in the fallout from the pandemic and warned that 25m jobs are at risk.“This is an emergency. Airlines around the world are struggling to survive,” Alexandre de Juniac, Iata’s director general, said last week.“Governments will need financially viable airlines to lead the economic recovery. Many of them won’t be around to do that if they have run out of cash. “We could see more than half of passenger revenues disappear. That would be a $314bn hit. And without urgent relief, many airlines will not survive to lead the economic recovery.”Several airlines around the world are on the brink of collapse and many are urgently trying to secure government bailouts or emergency bank loans.Germany’s Lufthansa is reportedly considering filing for creditor protection, as negotiations over state bailouts collapsed on Tuesday night. The airline is said to be burning through €1m of cash every hour, and has warned it will have 10,000 too many staff when it emerges from the crisis as a much smaller operator.The budget airline Norwegian has warned that virtually all of its fleet of aircraft will remain grounded until 2021 and is seeking to persuade shareholders to accept a government-backed rescue plan that will wipe out most of their investments. Virgin Atlantic is trying to find an investor to pump in millions to keep it afloat as it negotiates with the government for a £500m emergency loan. Virgin Australia collapsed into administration last week.Easyjet has borrowed £600m from the government under its Covid Corporate Financing Facility, allowing it to survive another nine months at the present rate of cash burn.In a statement to the stock market, IAG said: “In light of the impact of Covid-19 on current operations and the expectation that the recovery of passenger demand to 2019 levels will take several years, British Airways is formally notifying its trade unions about a proposed restructuring and redundancy programme.“The proposals remain subject to consultation but it is likely that they will affect most of British Airways’ employees and may result in the redundancy of up to 12,000 of them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a78bc19ab85d06f90f5debf53c7625d1356b8146/0_434_4376_2626/master/4376.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c426e4a7db6c56e69e5dc7440e297c2b","title":"uk delivery drivers how have you been affected by coronavirus","story":"If you work as a food or goods delivery courier in the UK, we’d like to hear about your experiencesWhether you deliver packages for online retailers or drop off people’s supermarket home deliveries, we’d like to hear how your work has been affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

All our restaurants will continue serving a limited menu to help the smaller kitchen teams maintain social distancing.”KFC has more than 900 branches in the UK and employs around 24,000 members of staff. Deliveries can be made via Just Eat, Deliveroo and Uber Eats.The chain is joining a growing band of fast-food companies seeking to ease back into business during lockdown, albeit not without controversy given strict social distancing requirements.Burger King, which has already reopened six sites for delivery and takeaway, is opening eight more from Wednesday, including its first ever drive-through.The UK’s restaurants and pubs are allowed to prepare food in their kitchens for collection or delivery in spite of the lockdown, and many have been providing free meals to NHS staff and other key workers.This week Nando’s reopened six restaurants in London and Manchester for delivery orders.KFC said opening the restaurants would mean that it could continue donating food to the NHS and key workers – typically 10,000 meals a week in partnership with Deliveroo alone – in addition to the 13,000 it has already donated.The UK government has said that these five tests have to be met before they will consider easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions:Paula MacKenzie, managing director of KFC UK \u0026amp Ireland, said: “I’m really proud of the way we, with our franchise partners, have been able to carefully get some of our restaurants up and running over the last two weeks.“This next stage allows us to continue to provide wider access to hot food for those who need it most, whether that’s key workers after a long shift or those working from home who need a quick, affordable dinner for the family. I’m hugely appreciative of our team members who have returned to work – it’s a challenging time for everyone, but we’re so glad to play our part in helping to feed the nation.”McDonald’s announced on Tuesday it was carrying out operational tests behind closed doors this week in preparation for a limited reopening of some restaurants.Paul Pomroy, the chief executive of McDonald’s UK and Ireland, said reopening would happen only “when we are absolutely confident we can have the right measures in place to ensure everyone’s wellbeing”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bc1876256d28fc76aed43f288c5b16bcbc828cb/0_0_5428_3252/master/5428.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e3ae4a77958cd889ba8a83dce91ddd7","title":"markets covid us economy federal reserve ftse dow business live","story":"UK stock market has hit its highest level since early March, despite coronavirus lockdown hitting retail sales and driving bad debts upAfter an upbeat morning, the UK stock markets is still at a seven-week high as traders await the latest US GDP report in 90 minutes time.European markets are a little more subdued, though:AstraZeneca, Britain’s biggest drugmaker, is involved in a number of initiatives to find a treatment for Covid-19. It is testing its diabetes drug Farxiga to treat hospitalised covid-19 patients at risk of serious complications to try and prevent heart or kidney failure.The firm has started enrolling 900 people in the UK, the rest of Europe and the US for a late-stage clinical trial and expects to have the first results in a couple of months. The firm also has two out of six medicines in the government’s Accord programme to fast-track covid-19 treatments, and expects to dose the first patients in the next few days.One is the blood cancer drug Calquence, which is being tested to see if it can suppress the cytokine storm that inflames the lungs and other organs of some Covid-19 patients. It has already been given to some Covid-19 patients with advanced lung disease in the US, where researchers at the NIH’s National Cancer Institute observed “some clinical benefit”.AstraZeneca has teamed up with fellow pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline and the University of Cambridge to set up a new coronavirus testing lab in Cambridge that should able to carry out 30,000 tests a day by early May. AstraZeneca has also donated nearly nine million face masks to healthcare workers around the world, including half a million in the UK. In April we have seen strong demand for home office equipment including computers and home networking as people work and communicate remotely.Gaming and TV sales have also been strong. In kitchen products, refrigeration and food preparation including bread makers have sold particularly well. This means Dixons has recovered around two-thirds of the £400m sales lost because its UK and Ireland shops are closed.It also reported strong trading at its Nordic stores (which are still open), where it has been learning how to operate under physical distancing rules.Shares have jumped to 81p, a one-month high.European airline manufacturer Airbus has struck a very cautious note today, saying the travel industry may not recover until 2025.“We are now in the midst of the gravest crisis the aerospace industry has ever known.”He believes it could take “three to five years” for passengers to be as willing to fly as before the crisis.Raffi Boyadjian, senior investment analyst at trading firm XM, says there is a “mood of cautions optimism” in the markets today.The rally in shares, and in oil, come as several countries began to ease their lockdown measures. Hopes that shuttered businesses will soon be able to reopen their doors has sparked a relief rally in risk assets.Just in: Economic confidence across the eurozone has suffered its worst ever fall -- quite a contrast with the recent stock market rally.The European Commission’s economic sentiment index has slumped to just 67.0 points this month, down from 94.2 in March and 103.4 in February.The gloom is darkest in the service sector - where the confidence measure slumped to -35 points from -2.3 in March.The survey also showed the consumers are more worried about losing their jobs, and also expect prices in the shops to rise.The days of cramming thousands of bankers into skyscrapers may be numbered, due to Covid-19.The City of London and Canary Wharf are both pretty deserted right now, with financial services companies telling staff to work remotely where possible - either at remote sites, or from home.Barclays has a large tower block at the Wharf, but CEO Jes Staley is pondering whether it needs to pack its staff into one place.He told reporters that the Canary Wharf offices will open gradually, with just two people allowed in an elevator at once.And in the long term.....“I think the notion of putting 7,000 people in a building may be a thing of the past. And we will find ways to operate with more distancing over a much longer period of time. Keeping staff two metres apart is pretty much impossible on a busy trading floor, unless you sharply reduce the number of people in the office at once. Bosses will also be very nervous about future disruption -- one Covid-19 case could force everyone to go home.Another factor: the City seems to have coped well with remote working.Staley says it is “absolutely remarkable” that technology has allowed 70,000 staff to keep Barclays’ operations running properly “from their kitchens.” But, there will be a knock-on impact if City workers stay home, as Neil Wilson of Markets explains:Working from home is clearly working rather well. Also, banks are no doubt looking at this and thinking they can cut costs by closing offices, call centres and branches.Nevertheless, it highlights how bosses and government have a very hard task in exiting lockdown. Moreover, what about the Pret or the pub that depends on lunch trade from the City workers filling up these offices every day? The impact on the economy will be permanent. The oil price is recovering this morning too, helping to nudge stocks higher.David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, explains:The FTSE 100 is outperforming its equivalents in Continental Europe thanks to a move higher in energy, banking and mining stocks.The rebound in the oil market has helped Royal Dutch Shell plus BP. Well received earnings releases from a couple of big banks has boosted sentiment in London – the FTSE hit its highest level since early March. The rest of Europe is showing modest gains as dealers remain hopeful about the prospect of a further easing of social distancing guidelines.Hitting 6,000 points again is a “significant milestone” in FTSE 100’s recovery from the pandemic-inspired stock market slump, says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.He gives some of the credit to Barclays, where decent investment bank trading made up for growing problems in the UK economy.”Although Barclays has attracted flak for its commitment to investment banking, this part of the business is actually performing well at a time when the retail bank is facing a significant increase in bad debts.“The £2.1bn provision for this risk in the company’s first quarter update reflects the fragility of the UK economy amid the lockdown, while big falls in revenue at advertising giant WPP offer an insight into the impact globally. Standard Chartered, the emerging markets-focused bank, has also reassured investors today despite reporting falling profits.The FTSE 100-listed lender told the City that it sees signs of recovery in its key markets in Asia, predicting:“We expect a gradual recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic ... before the global economy moves out of recession in the latter part of 2020, most likely led and driven by markets in our footprint.”Standard Chartered is also setting aside more money to cover bad loans, with a credit impairment of $956m for the last quarter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f8f3565843feac00645af7a2ed203e4f810ad73/0_166_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38610fa9af01b45599dce8a945cf1b73","title":"ethnic minorities coronavirus inquiry","story":"Ethnic minorities are dying in disproportionate numbers. Yet many of them have little faith in Phillips’ ability to discover the causesCovid-19 has left many Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities particularly vulnerable: in terms of their lives, and their livelihoods.And while some of these figures may be explained in part by the fact that among BAME communities a large number have felt a vocational calling to the caring professions, it doesn’t account for the massive disparity in fatalities. Is part of the reason medical, possibly related to higher blood pressure and diabetes rates among ethnic minorities? Just as important, is it partly due to socio-economic reasons, related to poverty and lack of access to healthcare? Whatever the causes, if we are to pay the right tribute to the thousands of people who will have lost their lives – particularly those on the frontline – then we must, in an honest and transparent way, better understand why this seems to be happening.An inquiry by Public Health England has already been set up to look into this. Though it is expected to be relatively short, it should in time be able to inform a more extensive Covid-19 public inquiry. And in addition to the fatalities and direct health impacts, researchers BMG have found that BAME groups have already suffered a greater financial hit than the broader white communities – and have been almost twice as likely to have lost income and jobs. Many fear that after this pandemic things could get even worse.The inquiry therefore should be bold enough to examine inequalities in health, employment, housing and poverty in general. There are a number of traps we should not fall into. First is the growing narrative that Covid-19 discriminates, but that our political, civic and business institutions don’t. We know, for example, that a large number of ethnic minorities work in care homes, where they are low paid and possibly on zero-hours contracts. Many are faced with an impossible decision: do I stay at home to protect myself and my family, and risk having no money to pay the rent or buy food or do I go to work, probably on public transport, where I have greater exposure to the virus and am least protected? Nor should we overplay cultural and genetic factors, and claim this explains the ethnic variance in death rates.But perhaps the biggest challenge for the review will be credibility. Public Health England has given Trevor Phillips and his company, Webber Phillips, a prominent role. Yet a growing number of BAME groups and iniduals are struggling to find the trust and confidence in him that is needed for this review to be taken seriously.Although Phillips is a former head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, an open letter signed by 100 black British women states: “Trevor Phillips is now probably more famously known by many BAME community groups as having a recent history of discarding the very real issues and consequences of structural racism in the UK.”Another letter said to represent thousands of BAME iniduals in the medical profession has been sent to Public Health England. It states: “We express our concern that Mr Trevor Phillips has been asked to provide expert support to the review … A suitable candidate who would be trusted by healthcare professionals from a BAME background must be sought.”So Phillips and PHE will have a huge task in building the requisite trust for this review to be accepted by the people it is seeking to serve.Yet none of us should lose sight of what we could achieve with a better understanding of the devastating impact this disease is having on BAME communities. We could use this knowledge to reduce racial inequalities rather than entrench them further.Much has been made of the fact this is the greatest crisis Britain has faced since the second world war. Let’s not forget that perhaps the greatest thing that came in the conflict’s aftermath was the birth of our National Health Service. Just as Africans, Asians and Caribbeans helped Britain’s war effort, so they and their descendants played a key role in creating and expanding the health service.The fact that so many ethnic minorities have now tragically lost their lives to Covid-19, many of them while caring for others, should spur us to remodel our society – so it no longer leaves so many vulnerable people facing such intolerable situations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86c32df2aa1fce581bb6c93ab9e76652218919ed/0_32_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3b9c76ff353dc1b461efb81042fda7f","title":"airlines oil giants government economy","story":"This crisis is a chance to rebuild our economy for the good of humanity. Let’s bail out the living world, not its destroyersDo Not Resuscitate. This tag should be attached to the oil, airline and car industries. Governments should provide financial support to company workers while refashioning the economy to provide new jobs in different sectors. They should prop up only those sectors that will help secure the survival of humanity and the rest of the living world.They should either buy up the dirty industries and turn them towards clean technologies, or do what they often call for but never really want: let the market decide. In other words, allow these companies to fail.This is our second great chance to do things differently. It could be our last. The first, in 2008, was spectacularly squandered. Vast amounts of public money were spent reassembling the filthy old economy, while ensuring that wealth remained in the hands of the rich. Today, many governments appear determined to repeat that catastrophic mistake.The “free market” has always been a product of government policy. If antitrust laws are weak, a few behemoths survive while everyone else goes down. If dirty industries are tightly regulated, clean ones flourish. If not, the corner-cutters win. But the dependency of enterprises on public policy has seldom been greater in capitalist nations than it is today. Many major industries are now entirely beholden to the state for their survival. Governments have the oil industry over a barrel – hundreds of millions of unsaleable barrels, to be more precise – just as they had the banks over a barrel in 2008. Then, they failed to use their power to eradicate the sector’s socially destructive practices and rebuild it around human needs. They are making the same mistake today.The Bank of England has decided to buy debt from oil companies such as BP, Shell and Total. The government has given easyJet a £600m loan even though, just a few weeks ago, the company frittered away £171m in idends: profit is privatised, risk is socialised. In the US, the first bailout includes $60bn (£48bn) for airlines. Overall, the bailout involves sucking as much oil as possible into strategic petroleum reserves and sweeping away pollution laws, while freezing out renewable energy. Several European countries are seeking to rescue their airlines and car manufacturers.Even when legislators seek to represent these concerns, their efforts are often feeble and naive. The recent letter to the government from a cross-party group of MPs calling for airlines to receive a bailout only if they “do more to tackle the climate crisis” could have been written in 1990. Air travel is inherently polluting. There are no realistic measures that could, even in the medium term, make a significant difference. We now know that the carbon offsetting schemes the MPs call for is useless: every economic sector needs to maximise cuts in greenhouse gases, so shifting the responsibility from one sector to another solves nothing. The only meaningful reform is fewer flights. Anything that impedes the contraction of the aviation industry impedes the reduction of its impacts.Governments like the UK’s should drop their road-building plans. Instead of expanding airports, they should publish plans for reducing landing slots. They should commit to an explicit policy of leaving fossil fuels in the ground.During the pandemic, many of us have begun to discover how much of our travel is unnecessary. Governments can build on this to create plans for reducing the need to move, while investing in walking, cycling and – when physical distancing is less necessary – public transport. This means wider pavements, better cycle lanes, buses run for service not profit. They should invest heavily in green energy, and even more heavily in reducing energy demand – through, for example, home insulation and better heating and lighting. The pandemic exposes the need for better neighbourhood design, with less public space given to cars and more to people. It also shows how badly we need the kind of security that a lightly taxed, deregulated economy cannot deliver.In other words, let’s have what many people were calling for long before this disaster hit: a green new deal. But please let’s stop describing it as a stimulus package. We have stimulated consumption too much over the past century, which is why we face environmental disaster. Let us call it a survival package, whose purpose is to provide incomes, distribute wealth and avoid catastrophe, without stoking perpetual economic growth. Bail out the people, not the corporations. Bail out the living world, not its destroyers. Let’s not waste our second chance.

In a CNN interview on Sunday, Moon Chung-in refuted the conjecture that Kim is seriously ill or dead, saying he seemed to be holed up in the North Korean resort town of Wonsan. The man’s just taking it easy, apparently overseeing gulags can get exhausting..If Kim really is OK it might leave some people rather disappointed. Kim’s vanishing act has pushed his little sister, Kim Yo-jong, into the spotlight. She has become something of an internet pinup (quarantine is doing strange things to us all), and there has been excited speculation that she might become the Kim family dynasty’s first female leader. This would set an empowering precedent for little girls dreaming of one day becoming lady-dictators with a passion for crimes against humanity! “North Korea … is one of the most male chauvinistic societies in the world, but bloodline supplemented by status in the Korea Workers’ party supercedes gender,” one expert told Bloomberg.It has long been rumoured that Yo-jong, who is sometimes described as the Ivanka Trump of North Korea, is the brains behind her brother’s brawn. Little is known about Yo-jong even her age is unclear, although she is believed to be in her early 30s. However, in recent years she has started to venture on to the world stage, representing Kim at the 2018 Winter Olympics and publicly praising Donald Trump. If something were to happen to big bro she’s the obvious choice for supreme leader Kim’s male relatives are either too young or uninterested. His big brother, Kim Jong-chul, seemingly stays out of politics, preferring to play guitar and obsess over Eric Clapton.

He discusses his fight against circumcision, his fear of Harvey Weinstein – and why he is an optimist to the core‘I’m loving the idea of being here for a sustained period of time,” says Alan Cumming, speaking over Zoom from his “country pile” buried deep in New York’s Catskill mountains. It is purpose-built for isolation. “I realised I’ve been craving it it’s a shame it took a global pandemic to make it happen.”The 55-year-old actor has been rigorous about lockdown. He is asthmatic, so he has been out past his gate only once in five weeks. Cumming spends his days with his husband, the artist Grant Shaffer, and their dogs Lala and Jerry, mostly writing. In the evenings, he has Zoom cocktails – last night it was with his old Good Wife co-star Julianna Margulies.His home is cosy: a crowded bookshelf takes up most of the wood-panelled wall behind him a blown-up cover image of his first children’s novel, The Adventures of Honey \u0026amp Leon, illustrated by Shaffer, sits on the floor. He flips the camera to reveal a small outside clearing, empty apart from his trampoline, surrounded by maple trees. A porch swing is rocking he points to a storm on the horizon coming over the Catskills.Cumming was in London when the world began shutting down. He was starring in Samuel Beckett’s Endgame at the Old Vic, alongside Daniel Radcliffe. When the theatre closed on 15 March, Endgame still had two weeks left to run. Cumming may be enjoying this period of isolation, but he is worried about what state the theatre industry will be in when the lockdowns lift. There was talk of bringing Endgame to New York, but he thinks pinning down any dates would be too ambitious.“Until there’s a vaccine, I don’t think people will really be comfortable sitting in a room with 1,000 people right next to you, coughing,” says Cumming. “I just don’t imagine the theatre or cinema as we know it is going to be able to function.”Even if people are more appreciative of the arts during lockdown, it may not be enough to stave off theatre closures. The UK and US governments have always undervalued the arts, he says – a “rot that’s set in” since Margaret Thatcher (he has more than a few criticisms of Thatcher, having just watched the five-part BBC documentary Thatcher: A Very British Revolution).“Many theatres won’t survive, because there’s so much money going into unemployment and the health service,” he says. “Not only will these theatres not have produced anything or had any income, but there’s going to be a whole range of cuts. We’re all fucked.” It is unclear whether he is referring to thespians or, well, everyone.One person he does include in his assessment is the US president. “This could be Trump’s downfall. My mother-in-law is a Trump supporter and even she’s said: ‘Oh gosh, it’s terrible what he’s doing, using all the Covid press conferences as a rally.’ It’s insane and embarrassing and just disgusting.”He will be supporting Joe Biden for president, but he has his reservations. “He’s too old. I think Trump’s too old. But we seem to still be in this culture where old white men seem to be allowed to do anything.”Cumming has one of the most eclectic CVs in Hollywood: he is prolific, versatile and prone to reinvention. As well as acting, he writes, directs and produces. He has tried his hand at photography (his latest project includes the self-portrait accompanying this article) and he is a committed activist, particularly for LGBTQ+ rights.He co-owns a queer cabaret bar, Club Cumming, in the East Village in New York, and even has his own range of fragrances (the parodic advert for Cumming the Fragrance is essential viewing). He still has five bottles sitting on a tray in his bathroom in the Catskills. “I actually spray it in the wardrobe upstairs, because we’re not here very often, so I always just give it a little squirt of Cumming.” He describes the scent as “earthy”.He has just taken over the pop star Will Young’s role as the co-host, alongside Chris Sweeney, of the Homo Sapiens podcast – in which queer people talk about queer life – which means he can cross off podcaster, albeit reluctantly.“Everyone has a podcast now!” he says. “It’s like reality TV: I used to say I just wish everyone would go on a reality TV show, so we’ll all have done it and we can get it out of our system and move on.” Yet the lure of exploring one of his biggest passions – icons of the LGBTQ+ community – was too big. Hannah Gadsby and Stephen Fry are just two of the guests on the new series it also includes an interview with Cynthia Nixon in which she talks about parenting a trans child.Cumming has held the title of queer icon since the late 90s, when he was described by the New York Observer as a “frolicky pansexual sex symbol for the new millennium”. In November 1999, he posed naked for the cover of the US’s largest LGBTQ+ publication, Out magazine. The accompanying interview was his most high-profile announcement to the world that he had sex with men and women.“I still feel everything’s kind of grey,” he says. “It’s never felt complicated, my sexuality. I’ve never had shame about sex in general or homosexuality.” This he attributes to his late father (who died of cancer in 2010), who had an affair with another woman. He wrote about this extensively in his 2014 memoir, Not My Father’s Son.“Growing up, I saw a man who was unable to control his desire. It made me feel like I’ve got a sexual appetite and it’s not a bad thing. Seeing my father struggle with this and realising that he had no control over it made me feel liberated.”Cumming was born in Perthshire, Scotland. His father was the head forester on a large country estate on the Angus coast, which is where he lived with his mother, father and older brother. His father was volatile and violent. He would mentally torment his sons by setting them ambiguous physical tasks around the estate, hitting them when they failed to match his infeasible standards.Cumming had a breakdown in his 20s – the memories of a childhood dominated by a sadistic abuser resurfacing. Together with his brother, he confronted his father. They didn’t speak for 16 years, until his father caught wind of Cumming’s intention to appear on the TV programme Who Do You Think You Are?.His father told Cumming (via his brother) that he was not his son he said he was telling Cumming this to avoid him finding out on national TV. After a meticulous investigation, Cumming exposed his father’s story as untrue (he and his brother took DNA tests to confirm it).More than five years on, he is still stunned by the feedback from readers of his memoir. Many said it helped them address their own problematic relationships. Has it allowed him to exorcise the trauma of his father’s abuse?“I thought that maybe I would put him to rest, but actually that hasn’t happened,” he says. “He’s much more in my life than he ever was. And so he should be he’s my father. Any parent is a huge part of your life and pretending otherwise is not healthy. I feel in a much healthier place with him.”Cumming laughs dismissively when asked if his globe-trotting career has gone the way he thought it would when he was starting out as a young actor on the Scottish theatre scene in the late 80s. “I was told that things were not available to me because of my Scottishness,” he says. “America was never a thing. London was maybe a possibility. The idea that I would be doing what I’m doing now or have the opportunities that I have now, there was no one I knew who’d had that trajectory … those things didn’t happen to Scottish people.”And yet his career boomed. He moved to London after a roaring Edinburgh fringe success as half of the comedy double act Victor and Barry with his friend and co-writer Forbes Masson. Their TV series, The High Life, in which they played a pair of outrageously behaved air stewards, aired on the BBC before Cumming moved to London to play Hamlet at the Donmar under Sam Mendes. He scored an Olivier award for his role as the Maniac in Accidental Death of an Anarchist, as well as a nomination for his performance as the Emcee in Cabaret he won a Tony award when he reprised the role on Broadway in 1998.More recently, he has found success on the small screen with his scene-stealing performance as the spin doctor Eli Gold in The Good Wife. In 2018, he landed the starring role in Instinct, the first network drama on US television to feature a gay leading character.As something of a Hollywood veteran (his vast filmography ranges from Goldeneye and Emma to Spice World and Spy Kids), he has expressed solidarity with the victims of Harvey Weinstein. In an Instagram post, underneath an image of Cumming and Weinstein together, he said that he had posed for the photograph despite knowing about Weinstein’s hotel room massage meetings, his rage and his bullying nature. Still, he says he was shocked by the scale of the abuse.“It shows you how clever those people are,” he says. “There’s a difference between: ‘Oh, he’s a bit of an old lech,’ and being a rapist. That was shocking to me.”Cumming was bullied by Weinstein, with the disgraced producer pressuring him to take roles he didn’t want. “I remember being at the premiere of The Hateful Eight … and I’d just said no to Harvey to doing this thing. He was very persistent. I saw him coming, he was on his phone, and I hid in this doorway to avoid them, because I just didn’t want to have to deal with them. He was scary and also he was just overwhelming as a personality.” Cumming has witnessed phenomenal social change since he started his career, when homophobia was institutional and potent. “I think it’s great things should move fast,” he says. “The constant question I used to get was: ‘Do you think that coming out is bad for your career in Hollywood?’ It’s such a ridiculous question. I don’t think people in Basingstoke or Idaho are not going to go and see a movie because someone in it is gay. I really don’t think they care.”He doesn’t miss a beat as he moves on to the latest battleground for LGBTQ+ people: gender identity. “When people get all weird about people putting pronouns at the end of their emails, I think: ‘Fuck you.’ These people are being kind to you and doing you a favour by telling you how they want to be defined.”As well as campaigning for LGBTQ+ equality and HIV charities, Cumming is outspoken against male circumcision.“I never thought anything about my foreskin,” he says, “and then I came to America and I was having sex and people would just be gasping because they’d never seen a foreskin before. I was made to feel weird and freakish because I had an intact body.“It’s genital mutilation. And I think people say: ‘Oh, that’s hysterical.’ But we do it to girls and it’s called genital mutilation.” As for the religious grounds for circumcision, he believes these are “ridiculous”: “We choose to keep doing some things and we just let the weirdest things go.”Cumming is confident that this period of isolation will result in a positive social change. “I’m an optimist at my very core,” he says. “Any time when you’ve got to be away from everybody, to contemplate, meditate and be made to understand how your behaviour affects other people, I just can’t help but think that must be a huge positive.”And what about in the immediate aftermath? “I think there will probably be a period of rabid shagging,” he says. “I’m sure there’ll be some sort of swing towards hedonism, where it’s just crazy. It’ll be like New Year’s Eve.”The new series of Homo Sapiens starts 30 April and is available on all podcasting platforms"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84bfeb53090147672d7ae394c452aab6d5f983fa/165_313_2957_1773/master/2957.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2713c349679a11e47ec09991fb8c541a","title":"famous photographers donate prints for food banks in pictures","story":"Martin Parr, Nadav Kander and Elaine Constantine are among 160 British and UK-based photographers who have donated images to sell for the Trussell Trust, prompted by a huge rise in the number of people relying on charity.

It looks a bit odd, and a bit round.”Aerial photos of the ploughed field were unremarkable, but a Lidar image – a topographical scan using laser light – showed something that maybe, just maybe, appeared to be the ghostly image of a lost henge.A week or two later, having joined an online course run by the archaeology firm DigVentures – in part to help pass the time – Seddon uploaded his pictures to a discussion group, unsure if he had discovered a forgotten Neolithic monument, a former course of the river or a modern drainage ditch. The response from coursemates and professional archaeologists was as excited as he had hoped.While there is no way of knowing for sure without digging, says Lisa Westcott Wilkins, managing director of DigVentures, “we are very happy to say that this does indeed look like a ‘thing’”.Other known Neolithic sites nearby, the scale of the feature and the fact that historic field boundaries respect its course, all support the hypothesis, she says, that it could be a large henge – a significant find in this part of the country if so. “Of course, we are all just itching to get out there and investigate,” – just one more ambition put on hold by the current lockdown conditions.Seddon’s circular feature might be the most intriguing, but it is far from the only discovery shared by participants of the course. Developed several years ago to let students explore archaeology for the first time, or brush up on existing research, excavation and documentation skills, previous cohorts have seen about 80 participants at a time.But with almost all of this year’s excavations being shutdown because of the coronavirus crisis, the company decided to offer the course for free, and received an overwhelming response 4,000 people from 69 countries are currently learning how to read maps, draw up plans and record finds from their own laptops.It is far from the only online course to have seen a rush in interest since lockdown began, nor the only one focused on archaeology. The Council for British Archaeology and Lincoln University last week launched Dig School, an online programme of archaeology-themed workshops aimed at school children and families, devised by Carenza Lewis, professor for public engagement at the University of Lincoln and a former presenter of Time Team.But while remote learning can be a challenge in any subject, acquiring practical skills such as how to handle a trowel or dig a test pit might seem a particular challenge for participants who, in many cases, are confined to flats without gardens or limited to a brief daily spin of their neighbourhoods.Christine Green has had to temporarily close the craft shop she runs in Talgarth in the Brecon Beacons her daughter had upcoming surgery cancelled as the crisis began, “so this is a very worrying time for both of us”. Inspired by the DigVentures course, she has dug a trench a metre-deep in her back garden, in which she has found nothing more precious than a fork and a marble.“But a couple of days ago when sitting in my trench with my brush and my palette knife, I suddenly realised that I actually felt happy and unstressed – both feelings somewhat alien to me currently.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d465cec7da085d80eafdf6645f7c668104e81926/0_82_4288_2572/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=193011f08be87f6bbe5cc7439b55a72a","title":"shave it or save it the 11 big lockdown hair conundrums answered by experts","story":"Should you cut your own hair, cover up your roots or forgo shampoo for the coming months?

But most stylists have one word of advice: don’t.“I feel sorry for all the stylists who, after this, will be dealing with a lot of DIY disasters,” says Keri Daniel, the owner of Danique Hairdressing in Leicester. “If you really have to, then it’s worth investing in the right tools – even a professional would struggle to get a good result using the kitchen scissors. You can get cheap hairdressing scissors and cutting combs online – even razors – and they’ll give you a better finish.”With hairdressers and barbers closed, some people – Riz Ahmed and David Beckham among them – have opted to simply lop off the lot. It is quite the lockdown look, but it is not as simple as you might hope.“Think about what’s best for your household, because you have to live with these people,” warns Daniel. Like most professionals, hairdressers have a knack of making their job look easier than it is.“If you cut your own hair, you’ll need one mirror in front and one behind you,” says Stevens. “I’ve seen people using their phones, but it gets a bit tricky because you need to hold that, the comb, the scissors and the clippers. Get help if you can.”“The biggest challenge when cutting children’s hair is that they don’t like to sit still,” says Kelly V, the owner of Pixal-Rose Hair Design, a vegan salon in Swindon, who suggests keeping them occupied with a tablet or a book. For short hair, a simple cut with clippers is advised. For long hair, “brush the hair down, have the head tilted forward and cut the very, very ends off”, she says. “Don’t attempt anything too drastic.”This can be the biggest giveaway that you are overdue a trip to the salon, but there are better solutions than home-dyeing.“A zigzag parting can help disguise that regrowth line and, depending on the colour of your hair, mascara can be a great way to cover up greys,” says Stevens. “Or just have a bit of fun – we put a luminous green feather in one parting. It looked like Billie Eilish’s green roots.”Daniel suggests visiting your salon’s website to find out which products they used and investing in those. “You may be able to buy them through the salon, which can be a great way to support them while they are closed,” she adds. “Dyes that you might buy in the supermarket are not professional products, and it can make it a lot harder when it comes to colouring in the future.”“An inch of growth in afro hair doesn’t make as much difference,” says Stevens, whose salon specialises in afro hair. “It’s easier to disguise that it’s overdue a cut. Relaxed hair will have curly roots, but I would never recommend using a home relaxant – you will get snappage. You could go through it with straightening irons, but it would be very time-consuming. I would suggest just wearing your hair up.”Join the “no-poo” movement and break free from the shackles of commercial haircare! Well, it is one option – and the lockdown offers a chance to wait out the initial greasy period in relative privacy. Otherwise, shower gel can substitute for shampoo if you are desperate, according to Stevens, while mayonnaise, avocado or coconut oil can replace conditioner. “If you look at what branded products use in their ingredients, you can get an idea of the kitchen cupboard alternatives,” says Daniel. Of course, you are probably washing your hair far more than you need to anyway.“Realistically, you don’t need to wash your hair more than once a week, unless you are doing a sport or have a job in a kitchen,” says Daniel. For those of us who like to wash our hair daily, this may seem like a big ask. But she assures me it is possible. “On the third day, you could spritz it with some water and blow-dry again to give it a bit of lift. Stay away from the straighteners if you can. On the fourth day, you can start to wear your hair up. Dry shampoo and texture sprays can also give unwashed hair a little bit more life. You’re with your family and loved ones, staying home – it’s the best chance to give your hair a rest.”Removal of body hair – particularly pubic hair – is often best left to the professionals. While shaving your own legs may be straightforward, waxing your bikini line is another matter. So, is it time to go au naturel? “We’ve had lots of inquiries from clients who are midway through laser hair removal courses asking what they should do,” says Dr Chloë Butler, the founder of the Chloë Edit clinic in Worcestershire. “We advise not attempting DIY waxing, as it can be quite tricky unless you have the right equipment and patience.” While trimming or shaving pubic hair may seem straightforward, Butler believes some people would be better off leaving well alone. You may even discover you prefer your new look.“Make the right choice based on the type of skin and hair you have, not on whatever style is ‘trending’,” says Butler. “If you have a thicker hair follicle, you may be more prone to ingrown hairs or a shaving rash. If you’ve got oily skin, you may get blocked pores and irritation. Dry skin tends to be thinner and more likely to tear.” Ouch.Rather than shaving your head, Stevens suggests men try growing their hair long or cultivating a beard. If you are tempted by a complete restyle, he suggests ordering a wig online: “Walk around the house and see how you feel. What kind of reaction do you get when you’re FaceTiming friends and family?”Daniel believes that, aside from the buzzcut, other hair trends are likely to emerge after the lockdown. “It’s exciting from a hairdressing point of view. People who wanted to grow out their grey hair, or go from being very blond to a more natural colour, have an opportunity to do that.”“Ultimately, chill out,” says Stevens. “Embrace your new hair and, if you’re really that bothered, put a hat or a scarf on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f258d37ed46e9e5034dbc670a0d6175c99e8e4c9/0_931_2217_1329/master/2217.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc7d043ae1d9e6fe947ea0c7c0eadc7e","title":"irrfan khan a sensitive and seductive actor lunchbox peter bradshaw","story":"The Lunchbox star, who has died aged 53, was a vital bridge between Bollywood and Hollywood, and possessed a strong romantic appealIrrfan Khan was a distinguished and charismatic star in Hindi- and English-language movies whose hardworking career was an enormously valuable bridge between South Asian and Hollywood cinema. He was armed with a sensitive and seductive gaze: his good looks matured in middle age in such a way that he could play dramatic or villainous roles but also romantic leads of a certain age and of a certain emotional wistfulness. You could almost call him Mumbai’s Clooney — although it would be condescending to explain this colossal Indian star in Hollywood terms.I first became aware of Khan and his marvellous screen presence in Asif Kapadia’s terrific 2001 film The Warrior, in which he has a powerful lead role as the warrior Lafcadia, the erstwhile servant and hitman to a murderous warlord who renounces the way of violence, retreats to the hills and must then confront another warrior who has been sent to kill him. It is an amazingly atmospheric movie (which Kapadia brought off with enormous skill before his own shift into documentaries) and Khan’s cool samurai hauteur was vital in making it work.After a stretch of playing Bollywood bad guys, Khan found some further success in the Wilderesque ensemble romantic comedy Life in a …  in 2010, in which he was the gauche and leering guy with which one female character finds herself uncomfortably fixed up on a date. But perhaps the actual star-making breakthrough came with his lead role in the real-life drama Paan Singh Tomar in 2010, an extraordinary story that is a mix of Chariots of Fire and Ned Kelly. Khan played an Indian soldier whose talent for running made him a medallist at the Asian Games in the late 1950s – and then in the late 70s became a daaku, or rebel bandit, when he was involved in a murderous land feud in the Chambal valley with family members – he refused to surrender to armed police despatched to arrest him, resulting in a spectacular siege during which he was shot dead. The role – similar to The Warrior in some ways – was perfect for Khan’s ability to suggest mainstream heroism, but also a kind of capo di tutti i capi bad-guy aura, all encompassed in a still watchfulness in the eyes.In the English-language world, Khan’s international prestige had been cemented two years before that as the police detective in Danny Boyle’s feelgood hit Slumdog Millionaire, a Mumbai-set film based around the TV contest Who Wants to Be a Millionare? with Dev Patel as Jamal, the teenager from the ghetto who somehow found himself within an ace of winning the top prize on the legendary gameshow. He has to explain himself to the cop, and Khan’s mixture of tough, careworn authority with a hint of gentleness makes him just right for the role, as he almost certainly would not have been good casting for the brasher part of the Tarrant-esque host, played by Anil Kapoor. He was well received in Mira Nair’s immigrant drama The Namesake in 2006, and was also a potent presence in Ang Lee’s Life of Pi.In the last century, Khan took what were arguably paycheque roles in Hollywood as the stereotypical enigmatic Indian plutocrat in The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) as Rajit Ratha, the corporate executive overseeing the fateful experimentation laboratory, and in Jurassic World (2015), playing the park’s super-rich owner. Cipher roles, perhaps, but ones to which he brought a deadpan yet debonair good humour.These were only part of a string of credits, but the movie that allowed him to steal everyone’s hearts was the romantic drama The Lunchbox. He played the middle-aged office worker who finds that the wrong lunchbox has been delivered to his desk, with a note inside. This leads him into a heartrendingly chaste, romantic exchange of letters with an unhappy married woman, stuck at home in her housewife job, as he is stuck in his salaryman role. Khan found his finest hour in this story, with an exquisitely gentle, subtle performance. Rewatching The Lunchbox and The Warrior would be great ways to remember him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1470f797f81aff1c6e9ea9223a073ad579fac407/968_205_2137_1281/master/2137.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a14361a7df67a8a44c0e73bd5faff5ad","title":"my favourite film at 12 back to the future ii","story":"I can’t feel anything but eternal love for this propulsive, unrelenting time-travel sequel that changed my lifeI am rubbish at concentrating, sitting still and keeping my mouth shut, traits particularly intense when I was young. Consequently, my interests ranged from sport to board games to general wildness, tricky for an only child, never mind a complete and utter only child, and I could not be detained by toys, Lego or sleep, nor narcotised by a TV set.But every morning I was stuck in front of one anyway, when my parents dropped me at the childminder’s. There, I and various other kids were primed for a day’s education with a film that would show until we settled into a Vauxhall Cavalier, one in the front, five in the back, one in the front footwell, one in each back footwell and one on the iding hump to be whisked off to school. Which is to say that I watched the first hours of Summer Holiday and Scrooge so often that I can still recite their dialogue and lyrics – as well as ads from the commercial breaks. However, the consensus favourite, with which I was entranced, was Back to the Future. So when the sequel came out and I was off school because all the teachers were ill, I asked my mum to take me to see it. Though all she knew of the story was Christopher Lloyd acting up on Wogan, she agreed. Already buzzing after an illicit weekday matinee, I was soon buzzing from my ability to decode, analyse and explain an electrifying new world, while absolutely buzzing  from my utter absorption into it I was in love. Physically, I remained in the Harrow Cannon but spiritually I had been knocked clean into the middle of Hill Valley, and part of me is still there now.In the name of research, I began this piece by rewatching the original – mainly to reacquaint myself with its child-friendly themes of alcoholism, voyeurism, incest and consent, but also to imagine the sheer, affirming delight of spectating my parents’ courtship. In the event, though, I was struck hardest by its dizzying, euphoric perfection.Even before it starts, Robert Zemeckis’s title card appears, backed by the luscious tingle of incidental music – the message alert on my Johnny Fartpants 3210, now that you ask. Thanks to it, we’re straight back in the film having never been away, joining our great pals Marty McFly and Doc Emmett Brown right where we left them – with Doc expressing his desire to visit the future.Hindsight tells us that these are foolish words and, sure enough, he returns to the present in a right froth. “What, do we become assholes or something?” asks Marty – to my 12-year-old self a reasonable question, to my 41-year-old self a rhetorical one. But the problem is his son, Marty Jr – themes of raging ego and fragile masculinity seeded – who is about to trigger a family-destroying chain of events. So off he and Doc go to 2015.Jennifer, Marty’s wife-to-be, is also invited on the trip. This, along with the idea that one decision can shape a life, moves me because of how many unlikely things had to happen for me to marry my wife. However, I could never put her to sleep and dump her in a ginnel to spare me her feelings, as Marty does with Jennifer. “She’s not essential to my plan,” says the Doc.Without her, we make our way into Hill Valley’s town square, beautifully modernised. Foreshadowing a movie business dominated by franchises, Jaws 19 is on at the cinema – a virtual-reality shark attacking Marty is a sensational touch – and we’ve already seen power-lacing trainers, along with the prediction that a certain type of twonk would one day parade their jean pockets outside their jeans. But it is the hoverboards that really grab us.Anyway, Marty quickly saves the day, then buys a sports almanac to use as a betting crib when he gets home. It’s a lovely, human conceit, mixing elemental passions and aspirations with an essential truth: unfathomable wealth is generally achieved by cheating, even when accrued by those we love.“I didn’t invent the time machine for financial gain!” incandesces Doc. “The intent here is to gain a clearer perception of humanity. Our past, our future, the pitfalls, the possibilities, the perils and the promise. Perhaps an answer to that universal question, ‘Why?’”Though this prefigures Google’s conundrum by more than a decade, it does not read well, yet in context it’s a joke of rhythm, profundity and zest. Were we not so consumed by the movie it would remind us that we were watching one. Instead, we can appreciate yet another slice of classic Doc before he and Marty head back to 1985.The problem being that, while they were busy in the future, old Biff twokked the time machine and gave his younger self the almanac, creating a parallel reality. Thanks to Marty, his dad is dead and his mum is married to Biff who owns a dystopian Hill Valley it’s heavy.Marty seeks to remedy the situation, confronting Biff and eliciting the date on which he received the almanac, and then, with help from the Doc, escapes being murdered. Our heroes are ready to restore the world to its former vainglory.“You’re not going to believe this,” says Marty. “We’ve got to go back to 1955!” “I don’t believe it!” responds the Doc. “Unbelievable, that old Biff could have chosen that particular date,” he continues. “It could mean that that point in time inherently contains some sort of cosmic significance. Almost as if it were the junction point for the entire space-time continuum. On the other hand, it could just be an amazing coincidence.”In the wrong hands this would be intolerably twee. But if we choose to, we can remember that enjoying silliness is to be encouraged, joy overrides overwriting, and who really cares when we’ve been watching this film for an hour desperate to get there, wondering if we’ll get there, and now we’re there and Mr Sandman’s playing and YES, we’re back in good old 1955!There’s something compelling about postwar America: it was, for good and for bad, where the western world was shaped. That, along with its ubiquity in popular culture means I somehow feel connected to a time that I didn’t experience, and returning there now, I not only feel nostalgic about 1955, but about the time I lived through with my mates Marty and Doc.Settling in again, I’m gratified that, like any sentient adult, old Biff recognises that his younger self was a twat. Anyway, Marty retrieves his book and heads to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance. There, a small group of black people entertain a room full of white people, before the Marty in 1955 from the first film takes to the stage to culturally appropriate rock‘n’roll before it’s even been invented. Yes, their kids are gonna love it … but their grandkids are gonna scorn them for it.Losing the book again, Marty prevails in a tense, beautiful action sequence, before the film races to a finish how much it crams into 108 minutes is a lesson in propulsive storytelling. It’s true that 2015 Marty remains an “asshole or something”, but that’s cinéma vérité for you: who among us can assert with certainty that their middle-aged self was not, is not, or will not become precisely that? Ultimately, time travel cannot resolve this problem, which must be addressed by us and us alone.As a kid, I saw Back to the Future II as better and more complex than the original, but understood that the original would always be the original as an adult, I know that we can just adore both. So while the sequel could be defter, it doesn’t much matter, because when the words “To be concluded” appear, all I’m thinking is MORE MORE MORE.Art touches us in different ways – sometimes with emotion, sometimes with truth – and here it’s the unrelenting elation, flair and thrill that remain an inspiration. On which basis I’d be a right “asshole or something” to feel anything but eternal love for a movie which changed my life by penetrating deep into my soul to demand that I concentrate, sit still and keep my mouth shut."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e02834a48bf272110f6e7db45a9b3eff5f582a48/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03060aa59b8db650656975f3523f09a4","title":"tell us about your ultimate holiday food recipe","story":"We want to know the recipe you use to recreate the experience of food, freedom and funWith holidays on hold for the foreseeable and cooking a rare lockdown joy, your culinary repertoire can be easily expanded by recalling dishes that bring back memories of happier times on trips away.

Here’s how to make some quick, surprising and simple mealsIn this time of struggle and strife, the tin has come into its own. It is a humble creature not often at the forefront of anyone’s mind, but in reality the tin (and its jar, packet and pouch cousins) are often the backbone of what we cook and eat. The store cupboard provides a springboard from which you can be creative and spontaneous.Tinned foods are delicious, nutritious and inexpensive (not to mention extremely long-lasting). Their existence is a blessing that means you can eat juicy figs and de-choked artichokes all year-round, guilt and air-mile free.The following 10 tins are just a drop in the ocean of options. There has never been a better opportunity to try things that perhaps you have previously turned your nose up at or neglected at the back of your crammed cupboard. Heat a splash of olive oil in a large frying pan. Once warm, add one chopped garlic clove and fry until starting to colour. Add a pinch of chilli flakes and paprika and cook for a further 30 seconds. Tip in a 400g tin of tomatoes, 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp brown sugar, 2 tsp cider (or similar) vinegar and a drained 400g tin of cannellini beans. Season, then simmer over a medium-high heat for 15-20 minutes. Serve piled high on toast topped with a crispy fried egg or a blanket of cheddar.Mix together a drained 400g tin of green lentils, 70g plain flour, one egg, 3 tbsp chopped chives (or another soft herb), 1 tsp caraway seeds, 1½ tsp paprika, a finely chopped garlic clove and 200g coarsely grated beetroot (or carrot or parsnip). Season. Warm 1 tbsp oil in a large frying pan. For each fritter, dollop into the pan a heaped tbsp of the mixture, flatten slightly and fry for about four minutes on each side until golden. Meanwhile, mix 1 tsp harissa into 2 tbsp yogurt. Serve the fritters with a generous spoonful of harissa yogurt.In a large saucepan, heat 2 tbsp olive oil over a low heat. Sweat 2 finely chopped onions gently, with a pinch of salt until very soft (30 to 40 minutes). Add two sliced garlic cloves, two bay leaves, 1½ tsp dried mint and 1 tsp turmeric cook for a few minutes until the garlic has softened. Tip in drained 400g tins of butterbeans, lentils and chickpeas along with 500ml vegetable stock. Bring to the boil, then turn down and cook for 20-25 minutes. Add 200g of spinach and allow to wilt. Season and ladle into bowls, drizzling over a little more olive oil.Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large frying pan. Add one finely chopped onion and cook gently for 10 minutes. Add two finely chopped garlic cloves, one bay leaf, 2 tsp smoky chilli flakes, a pinch of cinnamon, ½ tsp cumin and two carrots, cut into rounds, then cook for 2-3 minutes. Tip in two 400g tins of black beans (including the liquid) and 300ml of vegetable stock. Bring to a boil and simmer for 20-25 minutes until it has thickened. Season, pile into bowls and serve with rice, a dollop of soured cream and, if you have it, some fresh coriander.In a large frying pan, heat 2 tbsp olive oil, add two finely chopped onions and soften gently for 10-15 minutes. Meanwhile, in another frying pan, heat 4 tbsp oil, add two aubergines, cut into chunks, with a pinch of salt, fry on high for 5-10 minutes, stirring often, until the aubergine is golden. Remove from heat. The onions should now be soft add to them two finely chopped garlic cloves, ½ tsp fennel seeds, two bay leaves and a pinch of chilli flakes. Fry for 2-3 minutes, then add 200ml red wine. Bring to the boil and reduce by two-thirds. Finally, add two 400g drained tins of beluga (or similar) lentils, two 400g tins of tomatoes and the browned aubergine. Season, reduce the heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes. Serve this ragu with soft polenta, pasta or a hunk of bread.To make a quick chutney, put 50g fresh coriander, 20g mint, one garlic clove, the juice of half a lemon, 40g desiccated coconut and one roughly chopped chilli into a blender with 2-3 tbsp of water. Blitz until smooth, set aside and season. Roughly blitz a drained 198g tin of sweetcorn and add to a bowl add a non-blitzed, drained tin, two eggs, 100g self-raising flour, 2 tsp mild curry powder and one finely chopped red onion, then season. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large frying pan dollop in heaped tbsps of the mixture, flattening each slightly. Fry for 3-4 minutes on each side until golden. Serve the cakes with the chutney and a lemon wedge.You will need three 125g tins of mackerel. Heat 2 tbsp of the oil from one of the tins in a saucepan over a high heat. Add 1 tsp mustard seeds. When they pop, add 1 tsp fenugreek seeds and three cardamom pods. Fry briefly, then reduce the heat and add one finely sliced onion plus a pinch of salt. Sweat for 10-15 minutes until soft. Add 1 tbsp grated ginger, five crushed garlic cloves, one chopped chilli (or equivalent) and 20 curry leaves fry for 1-2 minutes. Add two 400g tins of tomatoes and season. Simmer for 15 minutes then add the mackerel, taking care to keep the pieces whole. Reduce the heat and warm the mackerel through. Just before serving, stir in 100ml of coconut milk.Heat the oven to 200C180C fan400Fgas mark 6. Melt 50g of butter with seven tinned anchovies in a frying pan over a low heat, add one finely chopped onion and three bay leaves cook gently for 20-25 minutes until the onion is soft. Meanwhile, boil 350g tube-shaped pasta in salted water until tender. Drain and rinse under cold water. Once the onion is soft, stir in 50g plain flour, cooking for two minutes. Add 650ml milk, a little at a time, stirring until combined before adding more. Cook, stirring, until the sauce has thickened a little. Remove from the heat and melt in 230g grated cheddar. Mix an extra 100g grated cheese with 75g breadcrumbs. Tip the pasta into an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm), mix in the sauce then top with the breadcrumb mixture and a sliced tomato. Bake for 25-35 minutes until golden and bubbling vigorously.In a large frying pan, heat 1 tbsp sunflower oil over a medium heat. Once hot, add 200g green beans, cut into short pieces. Fry for 3-4 minutes until starting to colour, then add four finely chopped garlic cloves, 200g cooked rice, 1 tsp chilli oil, 2 tbsp soy sauce and the sliced whites of a bunch of spring onions. Fry, stirring often, until the rice has heated through. Push the rice to one side of the pan and pour two beaten eggs into the space. Leave the eggs to begin to set, then pull the sides into the middle, ensuring all the egg comes into contact with the pan. Once it is all cooked, break it into pieces and stir into the rice. Turn off the heat and stir through two 170g drained tins of crab and 2 tsp sesame oil. Pile into bowls and top with sliced spring onion greens and extra chilli oil.Heat the oven to 170C150C fan375Fgas mark 5. In a 1.5-litre baking dish mix three 411g tins of drained and quartered pears, a 290g tin of prunes in juice, six finely chopped stem ginger pieces, the juice of one lemon and 50g soft brown sugar. Bake for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a bowl, rub 125g salted butter into 250g self-raising flour until it resembles breadcrumbs. Stir in 50g more sugar and 50g roughly chopped almonds (or similar). Add 2-3 tbsp cold water and using your hands bring together into a dough. Remove the fruit from the oven. Roll the dough into small balls and sit them on top of the fruit, leaving space in between. Return to the oven for 25-30 minutes until the topping is golden and puffed up and the fruit is bubbling.Take One Tin by Lola Milne is published by Kyle Books.

Here’s the expert guideYou may have mastered several new skills during isolation – learning to hula hoop, perfecting sourdough, becoming fluent in any of the 100 minority languages spoken in Russia today. But one task is surely beyond the capability of mere mortals: cooking a burger. By cooking a burger, I don’t mean turning a small patty of minced beef grey. I mean a multi-sensory, artery-clogging, warm hug of an experience – like the sorcerers in our favourite burger places used to do on a daily basis before lockdown abruptly closed them.Given that we could do with a bit of comfort eating right now, I decided to get some of these sorcerers on the phone to see if they could help us recreate their magic in our own kitchens. So let’s start with the most important ingredient … no, not the meat!“Sometimes the bun is more important than the patty,” says Ben Denner from the London-based burger maestros Lucky Chip. “With the bun, it’s about keeping it fresh. If you’re buying from supermarkets then go for soft fluffy burger rolls rather than cheap brioche, which is often dense.”Lockdown hasn’t been kind to those lacking outdoor space, but for burger-making it’s not a problem. None of the experts I spoke to think a barbecue is the best way to cook instead use a flat, non-stick pan, make sure it’s as hot as possible, and resist the temptation to use oil. “A flat surface seals in all that fat and flavour,” says Barton. “Whereas when you barbecue, a lot of the fat drips through the grill into the fire.” He adds: “You want a crispy sear, because that’s where the flavour is. You can push the burger gently into the frying pan to get a better contact.” Don’t sacrifice this sear for the promise of rarer meat – the focus should be on getting the exterior crust perfected, even if it means a more well-done inside.Cheese is your next consideration, and Barton believes he has “never tried a cheese that doesn’t taste good with a burger, from super-aged Wookey Hole cheddar and blue cheeses to bog-standard American cheese that gets nice and gloopy.” Put the cheese on your burger while it’s in the pan to melt it. If your pan has a lid then whack that on, too, and consider putting the bun top in right at the end. “It will keep the moisture in,” says Denner. “You want it to be soft, like you’re biting into a cloud.” (If you don’t have a lid, you can steam the bun in the oven for 30 seconds with a splash of water on it.)Of course there is more to a burger than bread, meat and cheese. As Sophie Michell, the food and drink director at Byron, points out: “McDonald’s made an entire business out of burger sauce.” Her recipe for classic burger sauce involves mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, garlic, Tabasco and Worcestershire sauce, with hand-cut shallots and gherkins to bring vital chunky texture. Trial and error may be involved to get it perfect for you – “I always use extra Tabasco for added kick,” she says.Barton believes the best burgers hit all the flavour notes: salt, sweet and sour. He suggests dry-cured, smoked streaky bacon for the former, and a sharp pickle for the latter. Sauce and relish should bring the sweetness to make it harmonious. I particularly like one of his expert tips, which he says has been hard-earned after a decade eating hundreds of burgers: “Put the pickles under the meat, because that’s where it interacts best with the beef,” he says. “Generally, when you eat a burger the thing that’s on the top is the thing you will taste the most because it hits the roof of your mouth and then down on to your taste buds. We had no idea about any of this before we started out.”You should now be set to make a classic burger – and all of my experts are adamant that a classic burger is best. But that is not to say you can’t try things out. “My rule is never more than two wacky things at once,” says Denner. “I find onion rings are always good in a burger, and at the moment I’m putting french fries in the bun!”“One thing I always do is what I call fairground onions,” says Michell, “because the best onions ever are the ones you have on a hot dog at the fairground. They’re not posh, they’re not caramelised, they’re just thick-cut, cooked on a high heat without much oil, and charred – almost burned – on the outside.”If meat isn’t your thing, you can still get on board. Denner points out that there are decent meat-free supermarket patties available these days. Michell, meanwhile, prefers to use whole vegetables. “I’ll roast or boil a whole beetroot, slice it into thick slices, then chargrill it and that’s my burger – served with garlic cream cheese and rocket.”Ultimately, it’s up to how you like your burger. “We’ve tried everything,” says Barton. “We’ve even put a Sunday roast in a burger. Whatever flavours you like will pretty much work, so experiment.” You may even have some time to do that right now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/439db40b8a6e4e7d91d3f672effbcc833eae58ca/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d73c844b2df775e9755a7c17908aaa0d","title":"underrated premier league players part one from arsenal to liverpool","story":"We look at players who have been important to the their clubs but perhaps not always received the credit they deservedPosition Centre-forward Time at club 2012-2018 League appsgoals 18073Karim Benzema might take issue with the idea, but Giroud has always been more than a chugging go-kart. Perhaps his misfortune was that, for most of his time at Arsenal, there was someone else to take the limelight. Arriving in the wake of Robin van Persie’s departure made for unenviable timing, while he pitched up just as Theo Walcott produced his most spectacular season and, later on, was overshadowed by Alexis Sánchez and Alexandre Lacazette. But Giroud was far more than a bridesmaid: his goal tally hit the late-teens in five of six seasons, while moments such as the “scorpion” strike against Crystal Palace and the chip that set up Aaron Ramsey’s 2017 FA Cup final winner – one of three won on Giroud’s watch – were ample proof of his erse gifts. Nick AmesPosition Left-back Time at club 2005-2010 League appsgoals 831The Dutchman is seldom recalled as a top Premier League import but for two seasons he was one of its most satisfying performers. It took him time to adapt after being signed by David O’Leary and he did not flourish until Martin O’Neill made him first choice. Then he bossed Villa’s left flank, powerfully shutting down opponents and joining in attacks. An ankle injury in a 2008 Intertoto match sabotaged his Villa career. The club have yet to find a left-back of the same calibre. Paul DoylePosition Striker Time at club 2014-2016 League appsgoals 6124The Frenchman was 32 when Eddie Howe signed him from Charlton but Kermorgant proved a big hit, providing a touch of class and the perfect foil for Lewis Grabban and then Callum Wilson en route to the Premier League. Reaching the top was supposed to be impossible – at 14 he was told he would struggle to walk after being diagnosed with leukaemia – but Kermorgant carved out a career and his partnership with Wilson proved particularly fruitful, clever interplay allowing his strike-partner to flourish. Kermorgant’s stay was brief but, from the moment he scored a hat-trick on his full debut against Doncaster, he made a lasting impression. He retired this week. Ben FisherPosition Striker Time at club 2008-2011, 2016- League appsgoals 255103Two separate spells across three isions, more than 100 goals and a mountain of memories, the evergreen Murray has excelled everywhere from Oldham to Old Trafford in the blue and white stripes since first joining from Carlisle for £300,000 in January 2008. Murray’s achievements are not to be sniffed at and, at 36, there is an argument he remains Brighton’s most lethal weapon. After signing a new contract in February, Murray is well placed to eclipse Tommy Cook’s 123-goal haul and become the club’s record scorer. BFPosition Midfield Time at club 2017- League appsgoals 884Lots of Burnley players have been underrated, clubs punching above their weight tend not to get the recognition they deserve. Beavering away inconspicuously in midfield of late has been Ashley Westwood, an unflashy yet effective performer who rarely hits the headlines but whose contribution is missed when he is absent. The former Crewe and Aston Villa player will tell you he likes to keep things simple and just retain possession before moving the ball on to a teammate, though he does more than that. His anticipation is excellent, some of his through balls are inspired, and his set piece delivery is so good he has even started scoring direct from corners. A £5m bargain buy, even by Burnley’s frugal standards. Paul WilsonPosition Midfielder Time at club 2006-2017 League appsgoals 2491It was always hard to believe that the midfielder played in an advanced creative role for Nigeria. He rarely showed many incisive qualities in Chelsea’s colours – his only goal for the club was a close-range effort against Fulham in September 2013 – and there were times when he struggled to convince critics of his worth. However Mikel’s managers respected his positional intelligence and he was outstanding in Chelsea’s greatest triumph, the victory over Bayern in the 2012 Champions League final. Jacob SteinbergPosition Midfielder Time at club 2014- League appsgoals 18817Having helped Wigan win the FA Cup 12 months earlier, McArthur was initially meant to join Leicester in 2014 but ended up at Selhurst after Nigel Pearson opted to sign Esteban Cambiasso instead. The versatile Scot has since established himself as an integral part of the SE25 furniture, with only Wilfried Zaha having made more than his 188 Premier League appearances of the current squad. McArthur has been deployed in most midfield positions over the past six years and even stood in at left-back during one injury crisis. His reunification with his former Hamilton and Wigan teammate and near namesake James McCarthy also appears to have given the 32-year-old Glaswegian a new lease of life as he approaches 500 career league appearances. Ed AaronsPosition Midfield Time at club 2003-2016 League appsgoals 35243His statistics and longevity reflect a fine career yet there is no question the academy graduate’s talent often went unrecognised outside, and sometimes inside, Goodison Park. The midfielder’s superb technical ability marked him out as potential first-team material when Everton won the FA Youth Cup in 1998 only for a serious knee injury to delay his development. Osman eventually established himself under David Moyes and, while his versatility came at the expense of a settled position, he produced many exquisite moments, not least a stunning goal against Larissa in the 2007-08 Uefa Cup. Recognition at senior England level finally arrived at 31. Andy HunterPosition Midfield Time at club 2014- League appsgoals 16410Like Muzzy Izzet before him, Albrighton is loved by Leicester fans but not fully appreciated outside the club. His performances since joining on a free from Aston Villa put him close to Riyad Mahrez and N’Golo Kanté in the rankings of great Premier League bargains. He has also been one of the ision’s best crossers, but that is merely the most eye-catching quality of a clever, dynamic and versatile player. He was key to the title-winning team, shone in the Champions League and, somehow, never got called up by England. PDPosition Right-back Time at club 2003-08 League appsgoals 1451There was only one Champions League winner who could not be tracked down for the 10-year anniversary celebration of Istanbul in 2015. It was no surprise, and highly appropriate, that it was Steve Finnan. Unfussy summed up his approach on and off the pitch, but for the bulk of his Anfield career the Republic of Ireland international was a highly effective solution to a right-back problem that preceded and followed him. In Istanbul he was injured and replaced at half-time by the game-changing Dietmar Hamann. When the 10-year anniversary arrived he was managing a property business in London. He retired only two years after leaving Liverpool, having fallen foul of Rafael Benítez’s fixation with changing right-backs, but his rise from non-league football was uncharacteristically spectacular.

My guess it was Laurie Sivell who kept goal for Ipswich Town in the 70s,” writes Mitch Mitchell.Peter Tomlin gets out the tape measure. “Laurie Sivell is 5ft 8in tall (1.73m). There are three goalkeepers who have played in the top ision in England that are officially recorded as being shorter than him. Ted Burgin was 5ft 7in (1.70m) and Burgin played three seasons in the top ision for Sheffield United in the 1950s and won two caps for England B. He was also in the England squad for the 1954 World Cup although he didn’t play. Steve Death was 5ft 7in (1.70m). He played one top-flight game for West Ham v Manchester City in 1969. He is more famous as a Reading player in the lower isions where he had a very successful career. He also held the record for the most minutes without conceding a goal (1,074) until 2009.“Teddy Davison, at 5ft 7in (1.70m), is the shortest goalkeeper to have played for England (one cap v Wales in 1922). He was first choice for Sheffield Wednesday for 12 seasons either side of the first world war and is recorded as saving 24 penalties of 77 in his career. He later managed Sheffield United.” Richard Worrall points out that Les Green, of Brian Clough’s Derby County team from 1968 to 1971, was 5ft 8in, the same as Sivell.Fast forward to the Premier League era and Matthew Healey has a couple of contenders, having made the point that “it’s a matter of scientific record that (particularly) men lie about their height generally. And the effect is likely to be magnified where there’s a professional imperative to exaggerate, so there is dearth of accurate information.“I’m confident-ish that the shortest goalkeeper (at least by their declared height) to play during the Premier League era is Clive Baker, who stood at 5ft 9in and was Ipswich’s first choice for a few seasons in the 90s. I vaguely remember him being a keen sweeper-up and a good reaction keeper – both useful attributes if you can’t touch the crossbar.”Matthew starts flying without wings at this point. “If you’re willing to count unused subs, however, there may be a better contender. A 16-year-old called Nicky Byrne sat on the bench for Leeds for a game at Southampton in around 1995 (I’ve not been able to pin down the exact fixture, but you can read his own comments on the experience.) Some internet sources list him as being 5ft 8in or 5ft 8.5in though typically he himself claims to be a bit bigger. He was released by Leeds at the end of 1997 but popped back up again in Westlife a few years later.”“Wolves’ Europa League shirt is inspired by the traditional Mexican national team jersey, associated with record signing Raúl Jiménez,” writes Miles Johnson. “Are there any other instances where a club has released a kit to honour a national team or nation itself?”Robin Tucker suggests Barnsley channeling their inner samba spirit. “I remember when Danny Wilson was manager of Barnsley, their fans would sing ‘It’s just like watching Brazil’.” The chant began during the Tykes’ promotion campaign under Wilson in 1996-97, and still gets an airing every now and then. As Robin points out, this inspired club kit suppliers Admiral to produce a yellow-and-green away kit for the 2001-02 season. They picked a bad year Barnsley won two away games all season, and were relegated from the second tier.Birmingham City’s jazzy 1992-93 effort incorporated the colours of the Indian flag on the club badge and socks, reports Spencer Clark. The club were owned by British Asian businessman Samesh Kumar, until “his company then went bust and the kit was replaced by the new owners, David Gold and Sullivan.”Leeds United’s 2017-18 “#allblack” away kit was modelled by our star Kiwi striker, Chris Wood, and quite strongly resembles the All Blacks rugby shirt,” notes Nat Dufton. I don’t know if it was designed to make him stay, but he left for Burnley after one appearance in the kit.”“Fulham’s bright orange away kit in the 2012-13 season was a tribute to the Netherlands national team, rolled out with the tagline ‘Orange is the new black’ (in Dutch),” writes Alex Ross. “Our manager, Martin Jol, had won three caps in the early 80s. Sadly, it did not free us from the prison of mid-table mediocrity and Jol was sacked the following season.”Finally, Pablo Miguez brings us bang up to date: “São Paulo’s current third shirt is sky blue, a tribute to the many Uruguayans who have starred for the club.”“Who are the most successful shirt sponsors, in terms of honours won?” asks Simon Bradley.Tom Aldous nominates car manufactures Opel, who he reckons have adorned the shirts of 45 trophy-winning teams:“We were wondering if anyone had ever committed the unholy trinity of missing a penalty, scoring an own goal and being sent off in the same match?” wrote Richard and Andrew in May 2012.“Not exactly that, but something very close to that, was achieved by Kenneth Omeruo, playing at ADO Den Haag in the Ereisie (on loan from Chelsea) on 28 April,” noted Stephan Wijnen. “In the game against VVV Venlo in the first half he first scored a goal, a few minutes later he scored an own goal, and in the second half he received his second yellow card and was sent off. VVV went on to win 2-1.”“In 1980, a policeman interrupted the Colchester v Millwall match and cautioned Millwall’s Mel Blyth for using strong language and potentially inciting the crowd,” writes Jason Jandu. “Are there any other cases of the police taking similar intervention during a match?”“In my isolation boredom I’ve been sorting through my old football shirts and packing and labelling them by season (sad but true), begins Michael Pilcher. “On my research I noticed that Gillingham – who usually play in blue – wore a red centenary home shirt in 2012-13, which they then recycled as their away shirt in 2013-14 when they went back to their traditional blue for home games. Are there many other examples of clubs wearing a shirt for home games that was then subsequently used as their official away shirt another season?”• Send your questions and answers to knowledge@the or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07a29d1744be0f8dc44f28082f501face8512105/0_0_3237_1942/master/3237.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=bf78ed8edcfa83fb1bb758051271dc8c","title":"polio campaign in africa put on hold during coronavirus","story":"WHO official warns of fresh outbreaks as jabs for 12 million children are delayedVaccinations for up to 12 million children to prevent the spread of polio in Africa will be delayed, in a major redeployment of polio eradication resources to fight the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.Polio prevention campaigns, which are vital to avert outbreaks, will be suspended until at least the second half of 2020, said Dr Pascal Mkanda, the head of polio for World Health Organization Africa. The decision will inevitably lead to a rise in polio cases.“We took the difficult decision to suspend these plans and considered it would have a significant impact on preventing the spread of new outbreaks,” he said. “New outbreaks of polio will appear because we will not be able to administer the vaccines in time.”The move is the “right decision”, Mkanda said, “because we need to tackle Covid-19 and because the process of administering vaccinations can actually increase the spread of the virus”.The effect of the lack of vaccinations has already begun to emerge. On Saturday, Niger reported two new polio cases, affecting children in the capital, Niamey, and the Tillabéri region, according to the WHO. The cases are the first in the west African country since an outbreak which lasted two years was eradicated last December.“Niger stopped the previous polio outbreaks by mounting high-quality mass vaccination campaigns,” Mkanda said.The country is one of 15 in Africa experiencing “vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks”, with cases spreading among parts of the populations yet to receive a vaccination.The increase and success of preventive vaccination campaigns around the world – particularly in Africa and Asia, where the disease has been a scourge – had given international health authorities hope that polio could be eradicated. Yet the Covid-19 pandemic has significantly set back efforts.Administering the oral polio vaccines would put patients at risk of contaminating Covid-19, the WHO said.The World Health Organization (WHO) was founded on the 7 April 1948, a date celebrated annually as World Health Day. As an agency of the United Nations, the organisation has developed into an international establishment which involves 150 countries and employs 7,000 people. WHO is responsible for the World Health Report and the World Health Survey. Since its establishment it has played a fundamental role in the eradication of smallpox, and currently prioritises diseases including HIVAIDs, Ebola, Malaria and Tuberculosis.\u0026nbspWHO takes a global responsibility for the co-ordinated management and handling of outbreaks of new and dangerous health threats - like the Covid-19 coronavirus.The current WHO director general is Dr Tedros Adhamon Ghebreyesus, elected for a five year term in 2017. Prior to his election, Dr Tedros served as Ethiopia’s minister for foreign affairs. He also served as minister of Health for Ethiopia from 2005-2012 where he led extensive reform to the country’s health system.WHO\u0027s handling of the global pandemic has been criticised by US president Donald Trump, who announced in April that the US will no longer contribute to funding the agency.WHO teams focused on testing, contact tracing and social awareness to prevent polio have been entirely redeployed to help with coronavirus.“What we are doing now on polio is to work very hard on preparedness and planning to be able to do more effective campaigns and really jump in as soon as the Covid-19 response activities have been stopped,” Mkanda added.The total number of Covid-19 infections in Africa is rapidly increasing – more than doubling in the last two weeks to 32,000 – with a similar increase in the number of deaths, to 1,400.Concerns that an outbreak could pose profound challenges to their health systems led many African governments to adopt early and aggressive measures to contain it.WHO officials on polio as well as other related health campaigns have been pooled to support health agencies across Africa."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a35146af4c173d4d6694e8d443b8741a26ceb8d8/0_111_6000_3599/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c82d536c60298bba9142531f0398bab","title":"guardian reports surge in readers support over past year","story":"821,000 people now making financial contributions, up a quarter on last year has recorded a substantial increase in the number of readers providing financial support to it over the last year, although the coronavirus pandemic has led to warnings that tough times are ahead for the business.There were 821,000 readers making regular monthly contributions at the end of March, up a quarter over the last year, driven by new subscribers to the company’s apps and continuing financial contributions from readers.There were notable increases in the number of people subscribing to the premium version of the ’s mobile phone and tablet app, plus people subscribing to the Daily edition and the new  Puzzles app. About half of the regular contributors are from outside the UK, aided by growing numbers of readers in Australia, the US and across Europe. Media Group’s preliminary financial results, unveiled to staff on Wednesday, led the company to state that it “achieved its goal of financial sustainability for a second consecutive year”.This means its cash requirements can be covered by the expected long-term annual returns of £25-30m produced by the Scott Trust, the not-for-profit organisation that ultimately owns the  and Observer.Full accounts are due to be released in July and the company said the main focus was on keeping the wider  Media Group business sustainable.Katharine Viner, the  News \u0026amp Media editor-in-chief, said: “Over the last 12 months the  has provided independent, fact-based journalism to unprecedented numbers of readers.

Since then, the company has taken measures to reduce costs by at least £10m and furloughed some non-editorial staff, while conducting a review of parts of the business that has led to senior executives taking pay cuts. Media Group’s chief executive, Annette Thomas, said: “The appetite for trusted, authoritative news and information has never been larger, but news media organisations face huge challenges: widespread disruption in the advertising sector, structural decline in print sales and rapidly changing habits of news consumption.

Today brings a new generation of rappers, swear-bombs, soft rock and tween chaos. Check back weekdays for more picksby  Ben Beaumont-Thomas,  Alexis Petridis and  Laura SnapesAs the coronavirus lockdown continues, the ’s music desk thought you might be in need of a distraction – something to send you down memory lane, or to ert the annoyance at your housemates or children on to us. We present to you a ranking of the 100 greatest UK No 1 singles since the charts began in 1952.We’ll be counting this down over six weeks – for the first two weeks, we’ll spend Monday to Thursday counting down 10 at a time. That takes us up to the Top 20, and from Monday to Friday for four weeks we’ll have standalone celebrations of each remaining song by our team of critics.This list, and the songs’ order, was compiled via a politely raging video call between me, chief rock and pop critic Alexis Petridis and deputy music editor Laura Snapes. The ranking isn’t based on sales or longevity, it’s the fruit of that discussion: what we as critics, fans and lifetime listeners think are the most brilliant songs to top the UK charts, and, of those, which are more brilliant than others. The only rule was that an artist could only feature once.As such, it is very much open to discussion, which we heartily encourage in the comments section. We’d love to hear what you think of our choices – whether in agreement or outrage – and hear your fond or not-so-fond memories of these singles. After we’ve reached No 1, we’ll ask what you think we unforgivably missed out from the overall list, and then publish highlights from your selections. Also, note that dates listed are the dates the songs reached No 1.You could spend years arguing about what constitutes the first rock’n’roll record. Rock Around the Clock patently isn’t it, but it was, incontrovertibly, the record that brought rock’n’roll to mainstream attention in the UK: two minutes of music that sounded infinitely more feral than its avuncular artist looked and that changed pop music for ever. APBy disavowing the hollow opulence and bloated scale of pop’s reigning class, Lorde accidentally ushered in a brand new one: there would be no Billie Eilish if not for her conspiratorial incantations. While she weathered accusations of appropriation for disavowing hip-hop cliches in her obviously rap-influenced delivery, she ultimately echoed the genre’s own move towards unvarnished portrayals of teenage disaffection instigated by a parallel wave of SoundCloud upstarts. As much a generational bellwether as a pop classic. LSRecorded in a Coventry front room, Mouldy Old Dough sounds like pop music made by people who have never actually heard pop music, but have had it described to them by someone who didn’t really know what they were talking about: pub piano, growled vocals, a beat that recalls a drunk doggedly staggering home. The weirdness of 70s Britain in musical form. APIf you wanted evidence of how far out, how unbound by the usual rules reggae was, you could find it at the top of the charts in early 1971: a piano line taken – sampled if you like – from Ramsey Lewis a vocalist who largely grunted and bellowed incomprehensibly in the style of a Jamaican deejay: “I am the magnificent W-O-O-O!” It still sounds fantastic. APThe pinnacle of Roy Orbison’s career as rock’s great tragedian: three astonishing, inconsolable minutes during which stars cry, rainbows weep, golden days are sorrowfully recalled and drums beat a leaden funeral march, before it all reaches a terrible climax, Orbison desperately repeating the title as if misery is a kind of catharsis. APIt won’t be too much of a spoiler to reveal that this is the only No 1 single in this list that concerns how the brutally uncaring nature of new technology can paradoxically deepen nostalgia while rendering the past irrelevant. Trevor Horn and co turned this material into postmodern gold, building jingles, prog, orchestral pop and more into a screwball fantasy. That cold steady kick drum, meanwhile, is like techno kicking the door down to take over pop culture. BBTAfter a fitfully successful start, this was the song to turn the Kosovan-British pop singer into a global star. You can almost feel her clamp a hand on your shoulder as she adopts a stern, schoolmarmish tone to dispense those rules for breakup survival: don’t answer your ex’s calls, let them pop round or even be their friend. She’s not telling us or her mates, though, but rather herself, making for a powerful pop psychodrama. BBTBehind the simple, perky rock’n’roll facade – “the ultimate fairground anthem”, as writer Bob Stanley put it – there’s something disturbing about Del Shannon’s biggest hit: an eeriness about the rumble of the opening guitar chords and the echoing keyboard solo, a sense the vocal is slightly too impassioned and pained. The result is as compelling a single as 1961 produced. APHad These Boots Are Made for Walkin’ been sung by a man, as its author, Lee Hazlewood, had intended, it would just have been nasty. Sung with insouciant cool by the recently orced Nancy Sinatra, however, it became something else entirely: camp but tough, funny but fierce, completely irresistible. APSaturday Night just pipped Gina G’s Ooh Aah … Just a Little Bit to our 90s Eurobanger slot. First off, it’s an actual Eurobanger (not an Aussie impersonator), and like the Village People’s YMCA, it has a dance routine invented by fans that came to define the song. It’s got an immediately iconic tag (“dee dee da da da!”), plus it was the victor in one of pop’s funniest plagiarism cases: I want some of whatever the person who thinks this sounds like Lindisfarne’s Fog on the Tyne was having. LSThere will be howls of protestation at Bieber being on this list, a man routinely cited as everything that is facile about pop and celebrity. Well, he’s had his moments, but this is one of his equally frequent triumphs. Taking the Insta-filtered aesthetic of the then-popular tropical house sound and marrying it to a melody that flits like a bird of paradise always coming back to its perch, it has the melancholically fleeting beauty of a package holiday sunset. BBTProducer Richard X gets a lot of credit for the shuddering magnitude of invention behind the Sugababes’ debut UK No 1 – the first legit single of the 2000s bootleg wave, bringing together Adina Howard and Tubeway Army – but not all of it. The newly minted trio of Mutya, Keisha and Heidi pull off a more convincing “I’m grown now” transition than any of their American pop peers, thanks to the terrifying nonchalance innate to British teenage girls. It’s got a classic belting “may-ee!” (that’s “me” in millennial pop terms) and without it, you wouldn’t have Sound of the Underground – or, even, possibly, whisper it, Toxic. LSLike the Old Testament God, Craig chills on a Sunday, but unlike the Old Testament God, he spends Monday and Tuesday engineering sex and spends the rest of the days until the sabbath having it. We looked upon his creation and saw that it was good: his vocals, drilled in the dexterity of the garage rave, twine around delicate acoustic guitar lines like two lovers in Eden. BBTEvery part of Adamski’s production is perfectly designed: the sad chords, the funkily interrupted alien transmission of the synths, the prodding bassline with its edges almost imperceptibly corroded by acid. Most beautiful of all is Seal: half activist, half oracle. BBTThe product of producer Joe Meek’s twin obsessions – space travel and the recording studio as an instrument in itself – Telstar is otherworldly and breathlessly exciting, piling on layer after layer of sounds so dense with effects it is impossible to work out what instrument is making them. It’s like nothing else, before or since. APThis will get you thinking, “I miss the old Kanye” – the rapper’s touristic whirl through Ribena, wags and the epithet “rubbish” is full of wit with just a touch of his incoming megalomania. Estelle is even better, perfectly capturing the mood of uncertain excitement at a potential American lover: “Like the way he speaking, his confidence is peaking  Don’t like his baggy jeans but I might like what’s underneath them.” The bump of will.i.am’s cosmic funk production launches it into the transatlantic skies. BBTDecades of ubiquity have dulled the impact of I Will Survive, but the song only became ubiquitous in the first place because it connected with so many people so directly. The strings soar, the lyrics project defiance in the face of a controlling ex-partner, who’s tried chancing his arm again: “I’m not that chained up little person still in love with you.” API Will Survive recast in hi-tech 90s dance-pop, complete with that notorious Auto-Tune wiggle to Cher’s voice. The effect is actually used sparingly, and the song’s wild success – 11m copies sold worldwide – is not down to anything gimmicky. Rather, it’s all very old-fashioned stuff that ensures Believe will be hollered in cheese nights for evermore: a powerhouse melody Cher uses to dispense a kind of den-mother wisdom. BBT“But I don’t look back,” Robyn insists over and over on her only UK chart-topper, though the racing arpeggiated synths, never resolving to the home key, tell a different story: one of someone doomed to the purgatory of heartbreak, or worse, revelling in it (a Greek chorus of strings charged with Kate Bush’s DNA outlines the tragedy). “And – it – hurts – with – ev – er – y – heart – beat,” Robyn pants, and you feel it, each syllable landing like a tombstone. LSFor someone who admits how hopeless he was at romance, Elton John couldn’t half-sell a love song. Are You Ready for Love? runs the gamut of emotions as he tries to win someone over: he’s casually cool about devotion yet awed by it grandiose in his overtures, then almost manically overcome by fear that this person might not, in fact, be ready for love. The Thom Bell-assisted Philly soul production festoons John with strings, hand percussion, wah-wah guitar, key changes – in a sense perfectly echoing the maximalist, hasty approach to seduction that John has said he practised at the peak of his career. It’s extraordinary that it took 24 years and a football advert to make it a hit. LSThis wasn’t the stuff of high-speed swerving grime bars. Instead, Dave and Fredo use steady, perfectly calibrated flows to set themselves apart from the London MCs one generation above them, set to minimalist trap. The effect is of being told something extra clearly, as if you haven’t understood: a brilliantly withering technique. Rap’s status as a core part of British pop culture was consolidated. BBTThe pop charts were particularly dominated by sweeping, sentimental ballads until the mid-1960s, and there are PhDs to be written on the effect on pop music of a sexually repressed culture of manners. Anyway, many such ballads are suffocatingly schmaltzy, but this one is sublime. It was written by Trent with Tony Hatch, a somewhat forgotten genius of this period who shared Burt Bacharach’s knack for orchestral drama. The pair had an affair, with Hatch leaving his wife and marrying Trent – this collaboration is full of that impetuous, untameable ardour. BBTIt’s unclear whether Thunderclap Newman thought they were making a kind of eulogy for 60s counterculture, but that’s how Something in the Air turned out. Its music is ineffably melancholy, its insistence that “the revolution’s here”, a year after the hippy dream had curdled, sounds desperate and hopeless. Intentional or not, it’s really moving. APPerhaps it takes not having lived through the 80s heyday of new age, then its subsequent ubiquity and mockery to appreciate Orinoco Flow as the compositional marvel it is. Yes, the lyrics are incredibly silly – but the layered pizzicato shimmer transforms Enya’s dippy travelogue into a true pop mirage, stoking its allure as her siren song constantly slips further out of reach. LSThe lyrics are essentially a QVC infomercial for the eroto-psychedelic effects of ecstasy – “Lotions of love flow through your hands  See visions, colours every day” – and the music is shamelessly designed to intensify drug experiences. The junglist breakbeats keep the energy high, while the big piano chords and yearning vocals are like a head massage from some bloke you just met but nevertheless now feel a deeper kinship with than your immediate family. BBTChannelling Bach and the Beats, the trippy imagery of this 10m seller made it a fave of those turning on and tuning in during the Summer of Love. But the Hammond organ creates a valedictory mood as the drug epiphanies betray their lies – “Although my eyes were open  They might have just as well’ve been closed” – and the entitlement and rapacity of the now widely hated Worst Generation becomes clear: “I was feeling kinda seasick  But the crowd called out for more.” A funeral hymn, then, but no less beautiful for it. BBTYou can imagine an older relative calling this “a proper song” – unfussy and instantly classic, where the quality of Eg White’s composition gives it automatic promotion to a different league. Young negotiates the middle eight’s key changes with the same sad certainty he negotiates his emotions, choosing self-preservation over a second chance at love. BBTThe softest of soft rock, If You Leave Me Now doesn’t seem to play so much as glide along, wrapped in a blanket of French horns and strings, the drummer tapping so gently it sounds as if he’s trying not to wake someone up. It’s impossibly lush and beautifully written, but its sadness is pervasive and affecting. APThe heaviest, sweariest No 1 in UK history – with one of the best riffs, too – only reached No 25 when it was first released in 1992, but reached the top in 2009 after a grassroots campaign from people angry at a run of X Factor contestants dominating the Christmas No 1 race. Its “Fuck you, I won’t do what you tell me” climax, aimed at authority figures from the police to parents for years, was gleefully beamed at Simon Cowell in a great moment for British democracy. BBTAlmost 25 years down the line, Wannabe sounds so rinky-dink and innocent (save the “zig-a-zig-ah”, which continues up a lineage of sexy pop nonsense started by Little Richard’s “a-wop-bop-a-loo-bop-a-lop-bam-boom!” almost four decades prior) that it’s almost inconceivable it was considered such a threat at the time. But it was: in two minutes, 53 seconds, these five women undid tween pop’s raison d’etre – seducing girls into a life of domesticity via parades of harmless male crushes – and rewrote it in their own chaotic, girls-first spirit.

From the plethora of TV shows on competing streaming platforms to the seemingly infinite choice offered by online music and gaming services, the wealth of new material being released each month is staggering. Yet when it comes to cultural consumption, audiences are increasingly choosing to seek out classic, safe bets – forgoing the next big thing in favour of the last big thing.According to UK media watchdog Ofcom, the single most-watched programme in the first quarter of 2019 was the 1990s sitcom Friends. In the US, the top Netflix spot has long been held by the US version of the Office, which first aired 15 years ago. Meanwhile at the box office, sequels and reboots abound. Last year’s top five grossing films in the UK included the remake of the Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: Episode IX – the Rise of Skywalker.Even computer gaming is stepping increasingly back into the past. Two of the biggest launches in recent years have actually been mini versions of the comparatively ancient 80s and 90s games consoles, Sega’s Mega Drive and Nintendo’s SNESNES. “Without a doubt, people are going back to the classics,” says Iain Simons, director of the National Videogame Museum in Sheffield. “They pioneered so many of the things we have today.”One obvious reason why audiences are opting for classic, safe bets is the sense of comfort they can provide in a world that feels increasingly precarious. This feeling of comfort isn’t simply a function of nostalgic familiarity, however. Today’s new TV shows often reflect our current dystopian mood and the fashion for grisly narrative plot twists and traumatic backstories. Think Black Mirror compared with Frasier.There are other reasons for playing it safe when it comes to pop culture. Partly, it can be about taking joy in simplicity amid the complexity of the world we live in. Our frantic pace of life makes spare time so rare that people are wary of not enjoying the little they have of it. “I can see the appeal in a safe bet, especially if you are going to spend a lot of money on tickets,” says Anna Smith, film critic, broadcaster and host of the all-female film review podcast Girls on Film.Likewise, Simons notes that there’s a beauty in the relative simplicity of older video games: “There’s something comforting about only having three lives in a game there are only so many hours in the day.”Nostalgic cultural consumption can also remove the all-too common problem of too much choice. “The overabundance of content can make people feel overwhelmed,” says Cristel Russell, a professor of marketing at Graziadio Business School, who has conducted several studies into people’s re-reading of stories and reconsumption of media. “It’s like going to a restaurant and the menu being 20 pages long. You’re probably just going to order something you’ve had before.”One of Russell’s studies found that revisiting cultural favourites is such a deliberate act – as opposed to a habit – that she coined the term “volitional reconsumption” to describe it. She also found that nostalgic culture can offer something that new works can’t: a form of self-discovery. “The thing you’re watching hasn’t changed, but you have,” explains Russell. “You’ve accumulated all this knowledge and experience, so you’re not looking at it through the same eyes. When you revisit it, you get to see how much you have changed as a person.”Revisiting pieces of classic cultural entertainment can also give us bonding social experiences. For instance, events such as Secret Cinema, which screens old favourites in specially-created immersive worlds, thrive on the feeling of community and belonging you get when you bring fans of a movie together to celebrate it. “I think one of the keys here is the community aspect: we love to watch a cherished film with others, and laugh and cry together,” says Smith. “In a society that feels increasingly less community driven, in many ways this is an outlet for a positive shared experience.”There are other possible psychological benefits to reconsuming cultural works. Erica Hepper, a lecturer in personality and social psychology at the University of Surrey, has researched the social emotion of nostalgia, including the reconsumption of works of art. One study involved letting participants choose an old, beloved song to listen to and then comparing their emotions with those of people who hadn’t done so. “Time and again, we found that people who listened to something that was nostalgic experienced all of these psychological boosts – they feel more connected to people, they feel better about themselves, they feel more optimistic,” says Hepper. “They also feel more motivated to achieve their goals. So nostalgia isn’t about being stuck in the past, it actually looks to the future.”Indeed, one of Russell’s studies showed that reconsuming cultural works can even involve more intense cognitive processes than watching something for the first time. To test this, subjects were made to wear eye-tracking equipment while watching a black-and-white Russian film twice. The equipment monitored both the movement of their eyes and pupil dilation, which can indicate the intensity of the cognitive effort they were undergoing. “Sure enough, on the second viewing, your eye gaze goes to different parts of the screen – you are taking it in in a different way,” says Russell.She found that people were watching in a way that suggested they appreciated the film much more as a work of art on the second viewing. For instance, they were looking at all the creative details rather than just following the plot. Moreover, she found that people’s pupils were more dilated while doing so. “When you rewatch something, the cognitive effort involved changes. You are hyper-responsive – all of your senses are on. It is a much more intense process than watching something for the first time.”That intensity might seem counterintuitive, given how comforting nostalgic pop culture can feel. But as the trend itself illustrates, opting for comforting pop culture isn’t a passive act. Given the emotional and psychological upsides of the tried and tested, it’s no wonder we enjoy watching things again. And again. And again.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

Alexi Duggins explains why playing it safe is a smarter step Has there ever been a more underrated word in the English language than “safe”? For something that is fundamentally a good thing, people can be weirdly dismissive about it. Eyes are rolled at workplace health and safety as though it’s somehow uncool to not lose a hand to poorly maintained machinery. Romcoms lazily wield it as an unflattering cliche: “Oh, I don’t know. My award-winning humanitarian of a partner is perfect in every conceivable way – but they’re just so … safe, you know?”Meanwhile, there’s no bigger cliche than being edgy just for the sake of trend-chasing. Over the past two decades, the fad for extreme sports has reached (and plummeted from) ever-crazier heights. Our fetishisation of high-risk, high-wire living has even spread to dining, with foodies flocking to increasingly ridiculous eateries simply because they look cool on social media. How many times have our friends told us they tried out a Hot New Place that wasn’t actually very good – while we pity their gullibility and coo soothing words such as: “Oh what a shame that insect-based menu wasn’t actually that delicious.”Spurred on by the peer pressure of social media and clickbait articles about patently daft new trends, people all too often act as if they’re playing a gigantic game of chicken. When they aren’t posting smiling holiday selfies from the post-nuclear wreckage of Chernobyl, they’re braving the latest Insta grooming trends that you just have to try – even if they leave you looking like you’ve had your eyebrows rubber stamped on to your face.The 21st century seems so unhinged, it feels as though it’s drastically in need of a friend to confiscate its phone and force-feed it a sensible mug of Horlicks. So as we enter a new decade, it’s time to wake up to the obvious truth that sometimes playing it safe might be the smarter option. Sure, it won’t necessarily make for great social media content or keep trend forecasters in business, but the tried and tested route at least offers proven enjoyment.But there are things out there that are just unfailingly brilliant – melted cheese, beaten-track holidays, every Bill Murray film ever made. These are just some of the reasons that “safe” should be something we embrace. Another is the obvious fact that safety keeps you, well, safe. Just consider all the revolutionary advances in car safety technology.The safe option is one that doesn’t lead to you royally screwing up. It’s a guaranteed good time. It’s not being afraid to use your critical faculties, shun desperate fads and to do something that you genuinely know to be great. It’s suiting yourself, no matter the pressure to do the same stuff that everyone else is talking about.It isn’t always easy. But increasingly, playing it safe is the boldest thing you can do.We’re under so much pressure to be edgy these days that we often overlook safer, more rewarding options. Here are some user-friendly safety tips to help you navigate modern lifeBinge-watching TVWe might be living through an extended golden age of television, but the explosion in edgy programming has also given us an awful lot of duds. So it can be all too easy to make a habit out of wasting 12 hours of your life. Protect yourself from another bad long-term relationship with a TV show by learning when to quit. Studios like to make a big splash on their opening, so if the first episode sucks, it isn’t going to get better from there on in. But what happens when you’re, say, four episodes in? One way to develop the discipline to quickly give up is to think of your time as an economic investment. Just because you’ve invested four hours, it makes no sense to invest more if there’s no likely payoff. Economists call this the “sunk cost fallacy”. Instead, focus on the future time you’ll gain rather than on the time you’ve already sunk.The beaten trackIt’s easy to have that once-in-a-lifetime holiday: go somewhere you’ll never, ever want to visit again. Plenty of people willingly do this in the name of adventure or to prove their alpha credentials. But there is much to be said for the relaxing and restorative joy of the safe, well-trodden path – such as comfortable beds, rainproof roofs and nice food. The trick to taking your first step back to the beaten track is to refrain from judging other people for choosing the tourist trail and package holidays – then hopefully you’ll stop judging yourself.Foodie warningSocial media and TV cookery shows have conspired to make food even more of a feast for our eyes than our taste buds. But trying to assess food’s deliciousness with your eyes is like trying to appreciate music with your mouth. It’s important to take food-based Instagram posts with a pinch of (figurative) salt, as some restaurants try to capitalise on these trends by creating dishes based around how they’ll look on social media. Avoid regrets by engaging in real conversation: if you see friends posting about having eaten somewhere that looks great, get in touch to check they actually rated the taste of the meal. Just because someone shares a pretty photo, it doesn’t make it a food recommendation.Before you startup, stopThe digital revolution has fuelled such a fixation with startups that it almost feels de rigueur to quit your job and start your own venture. Alternatively, you might be tempted to devote yourself full-time to your side hustle. Before you consider whether or not to take the plunge, one question you should ask yourself is whether the thing that you’re really fetishising is the idea of being a risk-taker rather than the venture itself. So be sure to scrutinise your real motivations. For instance, are you following your passion or your ego? And bear in mind that sometimes our egos are actually fuelled by feelings of insecurity.Savvy tech is safe techEach month brings a cacophony of new digital bells and whistles and it can be easy to simply dismiss them. So how do you sift useful tech from pointless tech? One tip is to ask whether or not the new app, gadget or feature will save you time, give you pleasure or make you safer. The latter question often gets overlooked. But when it comes to developments such as smart homes and in-car technology – including driver monitoring and assistance systems – making things safer is actually the main point.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

And these devices are already proving their worthWho hasn’t found their attention straying behind the wheel? Modern life is riddled with distractions that fight tooth and nail for our attention – whether it’s noisy children, garish adverts, tiredness, traffic cameras, personal pressures, endless to-do lists or those digital devices and social media notifications that we forgot to switch to silent. We always seem to be spreading our attention too thinly or are exhausted from having to think 10 different thoughts.This is one reason why the focus of vehicle safety design has shifted in recent years. Whereas in the past it was about applying materials and design to mitigate damage to occupants in crashes, it’s now about using the latest technology to prevent accidents happening in the first place. In short, it’s about cars that can take control when you have lost it.The shift in emphasis is often referred to as a switch from passive safety systems to active safety systems. Indeed, when it comes to cars, making things safer is one of the main drivers of tech developments. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) can aid concentration and alertness and encompass features including automated braking that relies on technologies such as radar, cameras and lasers. “ADAS has been a step change,” says Andrew Morris of Loughborough University’s Transport Safety Research Centre. “There was a consensus that human fallibility is hard to eradicate and that all passive systems can do is reduce damage. At that point, the focus shifted to prevention. New technology offers solutions in the shape of sensing and automation, which is a better philosophy because it also protects vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists.”Japanese carmaker Subaru has been at the forefront in the development of ADAS since 2013, when it introduced its “second pair of eyes”, the EyeSight system. This uses two sophisticated colour cameras mounted inside the car on the upper edge of the windshield above the rearview mirror. The system is capable of processing accurate stereo images to identify vehicles travelling in front, as well as obstacles, traffic lanes and other objects such as pedestrians.Using images generated by the cameras, EyeSight can run a suite of six ADAS:As with all the company’s core safety tech, EyeSight is continually evolving. For example, the Forester e-BOXER and Levorg now feature the EyeSight assist monitor, which provides a heads-up display of EyeSight system warnings for drivers to see more clearly.EyeSight is fitted as standard to all Subaru models, save the BRZ sports car. In 2019, the Forester e-BOXER achieved the maximum five-star Euro NCAP rating for safety and was declared “Best in Class 2019 in the Small Off-roadMPV Class”.Other Subaru safety systems include its Driver Monitoring System, which can detect the driver’s eyes closing or looking away for an extended period of time and trigger audio and visual warnings. This could be a potential lifesaver given that, according to Thatcham research centre, at least one fatal sleep-related crash occurs every day in the UK. Subaru’s Driver Monitoring System won the Technology Award at the 2020 What Car? Awards. What Car? praised the system, calling it “the most advanced of its kind”. In the tests, it proved to be more accurate at identifying when concentration was lost, compared with other manufacturer systems.Reverse Automatic Braking (RAB) and Subaru Rear Vehicle Detection also use sensors to spot potential objects behind the vehicle or in blind spots and RAB can even apply the brakes to avoid a collision.While driver distraction can be lethal, education and legislation – like the law banning handling a mobile phone – can only go so far.Full autonomy is some way off but, as of 2022, new safety technologies will become mandatory in cars and vans under EU law and are likely to be adopted in the UK – specifically lane-keeping assistance and advanced emergency braking. This will contribute to the long-term goal dubbed “Vision Zero”, of moving close to zero fatalities and serious injuries.But is eradicating all accidents possible through technology?“It’s very aspirational certainly and hard to achieve in the foreseeable future,” admits Morris. “However it’s a sound concept, a safe-system approach, which says if an accident happens for whatever reason we blame the system rather than the driver. And these systems will definitely become more effective as they are refined.”Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

While it is big, it is still smaller than the asteroid that impacted the Earth and wiped out the dinosaurs.”He said an asteroid was classed as a PHO if it is bigger than 500ft and comes within 5m miles (8m km) of Earth’s orbit.Dr Anne Virkki, the head of planetary radar at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, who has been tracking the 1.2-mile-wide rock, said understanding more about PHOs would help “improve impact-risk mitigation technologies”.At present, there are no known PHOs that pose an immediate danger to the Earth.The team began observations of the asteroid on 13 April.Virkki said: “The small-scale topographic features such as hills and ridges on one end of asteroid 1998 OR2 are fascinating scientifically.”Scientists will continue to monitor the asteroid, although the next closest approach is not expected to take place for another 49 years.Flaviane Venditti, a research scientist at the observatory, said: “The radar measurements allow us to know more precisely where the asteroid will be in the future, including its future close approaches to Earth.“In 2079, asteroid 1998 OR2 will pass Earth about 3.5 times closer than it will this year, so it is important to know its orbit precisely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df65e033048e96434b318434d929bacebe9c064a/0_0_720_432/master/720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc55f48c29efbb4bc3e049b22aadbd96","title":"youth worker coronavirus youth services young people pandemic","story":"The coronavirus has left an estimated two million more young people in need of help. Where do they go when youth clubs are shut?Beth Gee, 19, has been attending the Station, run by Creative Youth Network, a youth club in Bristol city centre, for the last three years. “It’s a place to hang out, see my friends,” she says. “I can also talk to staff if I’m feeling anxious.”Gee says that before the pandemic, she was having weekly face-to-face support at the youth club, in addition to support from her local mental health services. Now she can no longer attend the youth club, so can’t see her friends. Gee is relieved that at least her community mental health team has switched to remote counselling. She has autism, an eating disorder and anxiety issues. “I’m lucky, I’m still getting support, but it’s on the phone now and instead of getting an hour, it’s more like 20 minutes,” she says.Yet Gee feels she needs more support than ever. She works part time as a carer, looking after 10 to 15 older people in supported accommodation. But she fears getting coronavirus from or spreading it to her vulnerable clients. “Yesterday we were told of a suspected coronavirus case for someone on one of my rounds,” she says. “So now, on top of the masks and gloves, we’re having to wear face shields. It’s very worrying.”Gee is far from alone in having heightened anxiety levels during the pandemic. New research by the National Youth Agency, which works with youth organisations and young people across the UK, and the children’s commissioner, published on Wednesday, shows that there are now 3 million vulnerable young people in England who need support with family relationships, mental health, domestic abuse, or other needs. That’s 2 million more vulnerable eight to 19-year-olds needing help because of the pandemic.The figures were estimated from emerging data collated in March and April, including from helplines, sector reports and grassroots evidence, and compared with existing official data such as the numbers of children living with a vulnerable family background, figures on offending behaviour and NHS data on mental health.For many, youth clubs provide a vital lifeline, offering somewhere to go, something to do and a trusted adult to talk to. But the lockdown means youth services, already decimated after a decade of austerity, are not easily able to meet this extra need for help. Local authority youth workers have mostly been redeployed, while voluntary, sector-run youth clubs and centres have shut their doors and are providing limited services online. Most street-based youth work has ceased.The report estimates that nationally one in five youth clubs will not reopen, with a higher proportion staying shut in some regions, and calls for swift and generous action from ministers. “The government needs to provide urgent resources and funding to safeguard youth services,” says Leigh Middleton, chief executive of the National Youth Agency. “Three times the number of young people are at risk as a result of the lockdown, yet just as they need us most, the pandemic is pushing many youth organisations to the brink.”But it’s not all doom and gloom. In Leeds, for example, charity Barca, which runs youth clubs for 11 to 19-year-olds, is managing to reach many of the young people it works with digitally.Virtual club sessions through Zoom, and one-to-one online drop-in sessions with youth workers at fixed times five days a week, are both proving popular.Barca has also distributed 74 activity packs for young people and their younger siblings. “It’s great for them, but it also allows us to have face-to-face contact,” says Amanda Sykes, senior practitioner in Barca’s children, young people and family service.And last week the charity held its first socially distant doorstep dance session, run by social enterprise Dazl. “We had 50 people out in their gardens and 30 joined in,” says Sykes. For Demi, 13, who used to do activities such as football and cooking at the Fairfield Community Centre youth club in west Leeds, it made her day. “I have been really bored since school shut, but today was brilliant,” she says. Barca plans to roll out doorstep dance to other streets and start running doorstep sport sessions too.While digital support is better than no youth service at all, there are growing calls for youth centres to reopen. The NYA report calls for youth services to be designated as key work, so that youth workers can provide face-to-face support to vulnerable young people. “The risk to young people of catching coronavirus has to be balanced against the health risks of remaining in lockdown,” says Middleton.In Wales, where the Welsh government still funds statutory youth services and last year announced a new youth work strategy and a £6.2m increase in funding in its 2020-21 budget, some youth centres have stayed open during lockdown.David Williams, who manages Torfaen borough council’s youth service, in south Wales, says that statutory youth workers are currently helping support vulnerable and at risk children in schools. And for care leavers, there is still a face-to-face service. Weekly appointments at the Ashley House Youth Centre are strictly spaced so that the building can be cleaned between visitors, a one-way system is in place to ensure social distancing and youth workers are only allowed into the building for the duration of their meeting with the young person. “It means we can ensure that they have a hot meal, that their phone is charged and clothes are cleaned,” says Williams. “But most importantly, they get to speak to a youth worker, who in many cases will be the only person they have spoken to that week.”Some youth services in England hope to open their doors in the next few weeks. Stuart Dunne, chief executive of Youth Focus NW, a charity supporting youth provision across the north-west, says that all 23 local authority youth services are operating online. “A number are planning to reopen centres quite soon,” he says, “while respecting two-metre distancing rules and limiting the number of young people who can attend at any one time.”Ultimately, the nature of youth work will have to change. “We have to make sure that after lockdown ends, services are not only put back, but developed,” says Melanie Ryan, joint chief executive of Youth Cymru, the national umbrella body for youth organisations in Wales.Ian McLaughlan, chief executive of Youth Scotland, which supports 65,000 young people, 1,300 youth groups and more than 8,000 youth workers, agrees. He estimates that in Scotland, around half the youth groups have stopped operating for now, while the rest are operating digitally. Yet the Scottish government provides core funding to national youth services and has provided an extra £350m to councils and charities, some of which will find its way to youth services. “We’re not hearing that many youth groups saying they will have to shut down completely,” he says.A spokeswoman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport says: “We are committed to doing all we can to help young people in these challenging times. This includes grants available to youth organisations from the National Lottery Community Fund, Sport England and the Arts Council, and the unprecedented Treasury coronavirus support package for workers and businesses.“Our £500m youth investment fund will also provide long-term investment in the sector and make a positive contribution to many young people’s lives.”Back in Bristol, Gee hopes that after the lockdown, there will be less loneliness, a greater sense of community, and more human interaction. “I hope people understand that being able to socialise is so important for everyone.” For now, she is counting down the days until she can go back to Creative Networks and see her friends again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a3f0f49b1cda6c9ef507d49dd032155b5b5985e/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a88ee641f5c4fde348fd031e0c9aab6","title":"how humans have reacted to pandemics through history a visual guide","story":"From arguments about masks to riots outside hospitals, history shows some common threads in the human response to pandemicsInfectious diseases have wreaked havoc on human communities since ancient times.From smashed crockery in ancient Syria to attacks on doctors in 1830s Britain, there are many documented examples of the despair and chaos experienced by those who lived through pandemics.Our journey through the ages looks at the spread of disease in three case studies, and then explores a historical view on how we think about pandemics today.The Justinianic plague began in 541 and returned periodically until the middle of the eighth century. It is estimated to have wiped out as many as tens of millions of people, although due to the limited evidence it is difficult to know the true scale.The disease was caused by a bacterium called Yersinia pestis, which is passed on by fleas and rodents. It is understood to have spread across central Asia, Europe and the Mediterranean. Recent genetic research into different strains of the bacterium that caused the plague has uncovered new evidence of it in sites across Britain, Germany, France and Spain.found in Germany,France and Spain Populations at the time are thought to have largely believed the plague was an act of God. Prof JN Hays, the author of Epidemics and Pandemics: Their Impact on Human History, says people may have thought God had scourged regions and their atmospheres, and to counter this they tried to clear the air.He refers to an example of widespread breaking of pottery in Syria in the seventh century: “There was a deliberate smashing of pots people making a clamour. This may be an illustration of a population experiencing traumatic shock. It might have been done in panic but also might have been done to somehow disturb and clear the atmosphere.”The Black Death spread across Europe, the Middle East and northern Africa in the mid-14th century, wiping out somewhere between a third to half of the population. The pandemic was caused by the same lethal bacterium that caused the Justinianic plague.It was able to spread across trade routes, reaching Europe via the trading centre of Italy in 1347. Recent advances in DNA research have linked the Black Death to other branches of plague that circulated Eurasia around that time.Contemporary understandings of the Black Death drew on ideas of sin and apocalypse, acts of God and alignments of the planets. Many people turned to prayer. Prof Adrian R Bell, a financial historian at Henley business school in Berkshire, says Catholic priests formed something of a frontline in Europe. “In the 14th century there was a big demand for priests. Everyone who was dying had to be given the last rites, which meant the death toll among priests was huge and it was likely they had to fast-track replacements.”There is also evidence that people tried to make sense of the devastation by scapegoating outsiders. In England there were violent attacks on Flemish merchants and weavers. As Bell explains: “There were riots against the Flemish as people tried to deal with the unexplainable. This also happened later during upheaval around the peasants’ revolt, which came after decades of trauma from population loss and class conflict – people attacked outsiders for no reason other than that they were different.”There were six cholera pandemics in the 19th century. Originating in India, the disease first reached Europe in 1831 during the second pandemic, via military and trade routes. In Britain, the disease was first recorded in Sunderland, from where it spread across the country, killing 32,000 during 1831-32. It remains a widespread and deadly disease today in places where people do not have access to sufficient sanitation and clean water.The first case was recorded in Sunderland, October 1831Cholera riots took place in Liverpool and other citiesThe first case was recorded in Sunderland, October 1831Cholera riots took place in Liverpool and other citiesMortality from cholera was high and people died soon after being infected. Makeshift hospitals were set up in most major cities but there was resistance to this state intervention: riots broke out and doctors were attacked. People were suspicious of medics, who they had to pay for treatment, and afraid of their bodies being taken for dissection if they died.Dr Katrina Navickas, a historian of 19th-century protest at the University of Hertfordshire, says corpse-related horror stories also added to a climate of fear. “People didn’t trust the doctors, they didn’t trust the government, and they were wound up by body snatching stories in the press. On top of this, Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein was a popular novel at the time, so there was a lot of gothic imagery around bodies and corpses.”A lack of knowledge about the disease may have exacerbated the frantic atmosphere. It was not established until later in the century that cholera was spread through water rather than air, and as a result it was unclear how the medical profession or state could cure it. “They weren’t sure how cholera spread, they were just really scared and that’s partly why there were riots. People wanted the certainty of expert knowledge but they just didn\u0027t have it then,” says Navickas.Some medical historians suggest that the study of earlier pandemics can enhance our insight into the context around infectious dieases in the 21st century.Monica H Green, a professor of medical history, says historical analysis of even the first plague pandemic can help our understanding of how disease moves today. “Bacterial pandemics are different to viral pandemics, but they still move to human populations. In terms of human activity and the way humans respond to threats and change, the study of ancient plagues can enrich our understanding.”In this final section, Dr Caitjan Gainty, a historian of 20th-century medicine and technology at King’s College London, provides a historical perspective on four pandemics of the past century, highlighting some points of comparison in terms of how we think – and talk – about disease.Our graphic below indicates the scale of deaths associated with these four selected pandemics, including the first four months of the coronavirus.Between 20 million and 50 million people were recorded to have died during the Spanish flu, the most devastating influenza pandemic of the past century. For Gainty, one of the most striking comparisons is the public health response:“During the Spanish flu pandemic, they quarantined. They erected emergency hospitals. They had arguments about the usefulness of masks. Amid all of the remarkable progress we’ve seen in other areas of health, our public health response is largely unchanged. Our expectations about public health are remarkably different from other areas of healthcare.”The HIVAids pandemic began in the early 1980s and has so far resulted in the deaths of more than 32 million people.Gainty suggests the ongoing HIVAids pandemic illustrates how political the designation of a pandemic can be. “HIVAids is not really on our pandemic radar. Initially, this invisibility was the result of the well-known prejudices that crept in very early on regarding who contracted – and how they contracted – HIVAids. Today it results from the fact that HIVAids follows pre-existing lines of inequality. In addition to acknowledging its victims as equal to those of any other pandemic, understanding HIVAids as a pandemic helps us confront our own health biases, something that the current coronavirus may or may not accomplish.”There were more than 18,500 lab-recorded deaths from swine flu during the pandemic, but statistical modelling suggests the true extent of deaths could have been as high as 570,000.It was not unusual for the rhetoric around swine flu to be closer to that of national security than healthcare.“The language of preparedness and national security brought into common use during the cold war applied nicely to infectious disease. In the post 911 context, this language moved from useful metaphor to actual policy, quite explicitly in the US, where natural disasters and epidemic disease were placed in the remit of the Department of Homeland Security. Swine flu, like coronavirus today, was not just like a threat to national security. It was an official adversary.”There have been 217k recorded deaths and more than 3 million confirmed cases of coronavirus since January. Gainty says that in comparison with historical pandemics, one of the most striking things to emerge so far is how little states did to prepare for it, despite watching it develop in China for months:“In the past there wasn\u0027t the same kind or speed of communication about the movement of disease. It is not difficult to understand that in 1918 news about disease travelled more slowly and that responses were consequently slower. It’s harder to forgive unpreparedness, though, today. It begs the critical question: if it wasn’t more information that was needed to manage this crisis, what was it?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/772251cda4d3660faf1db0e8bb1c749fe40b7605/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b3391a87000edce5ad072604a7fbcc1","title":"my favourite game geek golf cap 1972 olympics","story":"Dave Wottle’s charge from last place to win an improbable gold medal in the 800m is a hidden gem Thirty seconds into the men’s 800m final at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, the American runner Dave Wottle is so far off the pace the ABC co-commentator wonders if something is up. The director switches from a wide shot to a camera aimed purely at Wottle. There are yards of empty track in front of him no rival is in sight. Concern is registered. “It’ll be a few more hundred yards before we know if Dave is seriously injured or really just lagging back to stay out of trouble.”It’s easy to spot him and not just because he’s detached from the field. Wottle is running in a golf cap, originally to keep his ginger curls in check but worn now out of superstition. This is Napoleon Dynamite, not your typical American track hunk.Wottle’s presence among these elite athletes is incongruous. It’s as if a Silicon Valley nerd has designed a computer sim of himself and entered it into an Olympic final. And, with geek detail, he’s put himself up against an authentic assortment of middle-distance rivals. So there’s a crack Soviet, two loping Kenyans, a hometown West German veteran and a have-a-go Brit called Andy Carter. An East German and a Pole provide further Eastern European intrigue.When the gun fires, it’s all very real though. His seven rivals dash for good early position, leaving Wottle bundling along at a pace out of sync with the field. He’s either a tactical genius or just hasn’t got the legs to go with them. Could he have pulled something in the warm-up?Coming around the top bend for the first time, Wottle still looks as if he’s misjudged the whole thing and is some way last when taking the bell. Finally, on the back straight, he moves up, picking off the West German Franz-Josef Kemper and Carter. But, as he does so, the gold-medal favourite Evgeni Arzhanov of the Soviet Union accelerates to the front. The Kenyan duo Robert Ouko and Mike Boit explode into action, too. The medals could well have been sorted.Our hero isn’t done yet. “Stand by for the kick of Dave Wottle,” bellows the main ABC commentator, Jim McKay, as their man bustles past East Germany’s Dieter Fromm and the Pole Andrzej Kupczyk. Wottle is now fourth with the mad sprint to the line in full flow but victory looks far-fetched. “And here he comes. This is the bid for a gold medal of Dave Wottle,” says McKay optimistically with three men to beat and the leader, Arzhanov, seemingly out of sight.It’s hard to know why this race remains a hidden gem rather than a well-watched classic. The YouTube clip is packed with oddities and McKay sets up the finish perfectly. “He’s got one Kenyan,” he screeches as a charging Wottle edges in front of Ouko. “He’s got the other Kenyan … Can he make it? … I think he did it! … Dave Wottle won the gold medal!” From a distant last, Wottle has burst past Boit and Arzhanov in the dying strides to get his nose in front on the line.But let’s not be content with the greatest climax to a middle-distance race in Olympic history. In a curious aftermath, McKay delves into Wottle’s unlikely back story. “People said he shouldn’t have got married, it was gonna ruin him.”There’s even a surprise punchline. After a promise to be back soon, the footage cuts to a rather weedy-looking anchor in the studio. As if recalling all those years ago when, as a 7st weakling, he was beaten up by the high-school quarterback, it seems Wottle’s win has stirred underdog revenge fantasies.“Dave Wottle winning our first gold medal today, and on behalf of all the skinny guys in America, I’d like to congratulate him,” the anchor says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d666b1f11373f1eacd8003f8f84b314ca264c670/353_593_2181_1308/master/2181.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9876f5850207980a7e56c28e11bae3a","title":"tokyo olympics not reliant on covid 19 vaccine senior ioc member","story":"A senior IOC figure has played down suggestions from the Japan Medical Association that it would be “difficult” for the Tokyo Olympics to take place without a vaccine for the coronavirus, saying they were merely “an opinion”.John Coates, head of the IOC’s coordination commission for the Olympics and a close ally of IOC president Thomas Bach, insisted that the Games going ahead were not contingent on the development of a vaccine in the next 15 months.“I saw that opinion but the advice we’re getting from the World Health Organisation says we should continue to plan for this date and that is what we’re doing, and that’s not contingent on a vaccine,” said Coates.“A vaccine would be nice. But we will just continue to be guided, as we must be, by WHO and the Japanese health authorities because in all of this, the health and wellbeing of the athletes and other participants in the Games is the number one priority.”However, the split over the issue between the organisers and the IOC was further emphasised when Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, admitted it will be difficult to host the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2021 unless the coronavirus pandemic is contained.When asked by an opposition lawmaker whether Tokyo could host the Games next year, Abe told Japan’s parliament: “The Olympic Games must be held in a way that shows the world has won its battle against the coronavirus pandemic. Otherwise, it will be hard to hold the Games.”The Tokyo 2020 president, Yoshiro Mori, said in an interview published on Tuesday that the Games – which had been due to start on 24 July before being pushed back a year – would be “scrapped” if they could not take place in 2021. Japan has recorded more than 13,000 Covid-19 infections and nearly 400 deaths.Elsewhere, the global pandemic is continuing to adversely affect the sporting calendar with the Vuelta a España cancelling plans to stage this year’s departure in the Netherlands because of the “exceptional worldwide situation”.While Vuelta organisers are still hopeful of the event going ahead, after the world championships and potentially as late as November according to some reports, they will now be searching for a new route.“The departure of La Vuelta 20 from Holland was a project that had been designed as a big summer party,” La Vuelta Holanda said in a statement. “Faced with the impossibility of ensuring the planned development of the race’s official departure, with all of the required guarantees for an event of these characteristics, La Vuelta Holanda has preferred to request the official departure’s cancellation.”The Vuelta was scheduled to take place between 14 August and 6 September, but the UCI announced earlier this month it would have to be rescheduled for later in the autumn after the Tour de France was rearranged."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f23b6a9376aca83c7c0b29a77aa7d56e6c872cd/0_127_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98b64fe59f9db9a6fa19e314a02046d0","title":"betty review hbo female skateboarders freewheeling comedy","story":"The six-part series, a spin-off of Skate Kitchen, is a beautifully shot and emotionally cathartic hangout of a show Betty, HBO’s six-part series about a group of female skateboarders, started with a fortuitous subway ride. A few years ago, the show’s creator, Crystal Moselle, a documentarian best known for The Wolf Pack, overheard two skater girls, Nina Moran and Rachelle Vinberg, on the G train in Brooklyn. Transfixed by their style, skateboards and Moran’s story of making out with a girl nicknamed “glitter tits”, Moselle approached them on the platform for an ad campaign. She later cast the untrained actors and several of their friends as fictional versions of themselves in Skate Kitchen, her loose, atmospheric film about a lonely suburban girl, Camille (Vinberg), blossoming in the friends’ all-female skateboarding collective of the same name.Betty, co-produced and written with Lesley Arfin (Netflix’s Love) and Patricia Breen, spins off from this absorbing world, a subculture gliding beneath New York’s expressways and through its tourist-saturated parks. It’s an even looser, more furtive version of the film, a beautifully shot extended hang with the same characters, though on an alternative timeline, with the sheerest of cable television gloss – organic inclusions of iPhones, Instagram DMs and “fuck yeah, dudes”, of joints passed around the back of a van, captured with a film-maker’s eye for emotion.Moselle, who co-wrote, directed and executive-produced the series, is by now an expert in this world, and Betty is immediately engrossing despite a wariness of the signposting common in many half-hour television series. The story doesn’t so much kickstart as, like a ranging summer afternoon with friends, spitball forward into a shape more distinctive for its momentum – flirtations observed in line at a Bushwick bar, tension clear in an aborted run for Boba tea – than its resolutions. In this version, Kirt (Moran), the group’s laidback leader, cuts through downtown Manhattan on her board, a jug of Arizona iced tea in one hand and her phone, FaceTiming her best friend, Janay (Dede Lovelace), in the other. The two are bound for the skate park, where they’re hosting a girls’ “skate sesh” advertised on Instagram. There they meet Honeybear (Kabrina “Moonbear” Adams), an enigmatic skater from Staten Island who lets her style – mismatched sneakers, open vest over nipple pasties, camera always in hand – talk for her Camille (Vinberg), a placid-faced, long-haired shredder who’s apathetic when it comes to female solidarity (she’s in with the boys) and Indigo (Ajani Russell), a Rihanna lookalike who deals weed with an acquaintance of the group.The shades beneath these at first glancingly presented personalities develop like Polaroids, in unstilted conversations as the summer days spill on (the episodes take place over a few weeks in the summer of 2019). The story unfurls underhandedly, with the ebb and flow of a tide seemingly off-hand comments – Camille forgot her backpack at the park, oh shoot, her friend’s wallet is in there, maybe try “Find My iPhone”? – become narrative arcs for whole episodes. The effect feels similar, I’d imagine, to Moselle’s experience on the train: observing a colorful conversation, and somehow following it through the next several hangs.Still, Betty does advance stories that are gripping in their believable un-sensationalism – a kaleidoscope of experiences for young women in New York that doesn’t feel too overtly “girl power”. (Guys’ dismissal of girls with boards does, however, course throughout the series.) Indigo’s drug deal hijinks become a referendum on friendship and forming her own ethical boundaries Honeybear’s timid wade into dating another female skater, Ash, reveals a person outwardly bold in style but privately circumscribed by anxiety. Kirt’s relentlessly mellow, karmic vibe – unless she’s defending her friends with immediate punches thrown – struggles under the weight of necessary apologies. Camille leans into her attraction to Bambi (Edmund Donovan), a skater veteran and “clip” maker Vinberg is especially strong in tracing the intoxicating burn and cold shadow of attention, and the belief that, as a woman, you’re being taken seriously. Janay grapples with a disturbing revelation about her best friend and YouTube show partner, a #MeToo storyline that Betty handles delicately without resorting to emotional gimmicks.The series, like Skate Kitchen, features beautifully propulsive sequences of skateboarding across New York, but shines brightest in its most stripped-down, documentary-adjacent moments of mundane girl talk: which strips to wax your pubic hair? What tricks do you use to not respond to a fuckboy’s texts? What didn’t you know when you were harassed, or assaulted, or belittled that time in the past, and how do you convince yourself it wasn’t your fault? These conversations, culled from real life, the type that really blur the line between acting and observing fully formed characters in their natural habitats, expand on the movie and offer an immersive, cathartic hangout.Betty, to its credit, understands that some of the most formative, generative moments in young women’s lives come from just hanging out, talking about today. Watching the series, with its characters all up in each other’s jumbled limbs and business in a bustling city, in this shutdown, feels like a dream I suspect the pull of a world that is realistic, but just a coat of gloss removed from ours, will hit harder now than ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a868f823c14429902a99937a4cadfc69304f1059/0_0_5232_3576/master/5232.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae120c471dc2a57190a032971390fa49 700w","title":"are you planning to mark a special occasion during lockdown","story":"If you are preparing for a big life event in the next fortnight, our photographer would like to capture the moment – from a safe distance Lockdown has wreaked havoc on our social lives.

His lawyers learned on Tuesday that his Covid-19 test was positive, and in a phone call with the , Asgari had a bad cough and said he had had a fever for days.He and his family are calling for his release to a medical facility where he can receive proper care.“It makes sense to send me to the hospital as soon as possible. I don’t trust them at all,” the 59-year-old said on Tuesday amid repeated coughing fits. “If something happens, they are not fast responders … I prefer to leave this dirty place.”Asgari’s story sparked international outrage after he spoke about his fears of Covid-19 spreading inside crowded Ice facilities with substandard cleaning practices and a lack of supplies. The professor, who has a history of respiratory problems, was exonerated in a US sanctions trial last year, but Ice has refused to release him or allow him to return to Iran. Iran’s foreign minister recently called for his release, as have some US lawmakers and human rights groups.Asgari is confined to a small room at the Winn correctional center in a Louisiana, a state hard hit by coronavirus.Ice informed the attorneys that Asgari’s test was positive on Tuesday, but Asgari said Ice had not yet told him the results and that he had learned of them on a call with his family and lawyers. “The nurse … always says the test results are not in,” Asgari said, noting that the medical staff checked on him twice or three times a day.Ice told Asgari’s lawyers he would only be released to a hospital if he was struggling to breathe, the attorneys said.Bryan Cox, an Ice spokesman, said there were two confirmed Covid-19 cases at Winn but declined to answer specific questions about Asgari.The professor has repeatedly raised concerns about Ice continuing to bring in new detainees into the close quarters of the facility, mixing them with those already jailed. Asgari said he got a bad fever after Ice recently brought a new group to his pod.The specifics of Asgari’s case have been particularly shocking to immigration attorneys. Asgari, a father of three, has deep ties to the US, including two children living in America. In 2017, he was charged with fraud and trade secret theft relating to his work with a university in Ohio. But after a long trial, he was acquitted in November 2019.But because the US had revoked his original visa, he was taken into Ice custody and has remained detained. Since the pandemic hit, he has tried to “self-deport” to Iran or get approval to stay with his family in the US but has been denied. Now, even if released, he would probably be unable to get on an immediate flight due to his diagnosis.Asgari said he was unable to shower while in isolation and was given a bowl of water he could use to wash his head. He said he had also pleaded for fresh fruit, which he has not had for a month.At Winn, he and other detainees told the  last month that many of them were trying to get deported because they were so fearful of Covid-19 exposure inside. Several men said the detainees were responsible for all cleaning, and there was a single shower and only two toilets for all 44 of them to share.

This is an innocent man who hasn’t committed any crimes. He shouldn’t be behind bars. Why does the US government continue to keep him in detention?”The number of positive Covid-19 cases inside Ice jails has been steadily climbing, with Ice officials reporting that hundreds of detainees have the virus. But only a fraction of people inside immigration jails have received tests so far, and rights groups fear the rate could be much higher. Some judges have ordered Ice to release detainees due to Covid-19 risks, and advocates have urged the US to conduct immediate mass releases to avoid a huge death toll inside.As of 18 April, Ice had 30,737 people in custody, and the population in jails has declined by roughly 8,000 since 29 February, according to the Ice spokesman.Cox said Ice had adequate cleaning supplies, adding in an email that the agency had “a long history of handling communicable diseases in the course of everyday operations” and had “taken extensive precautions to limit the potential spread of COVID-19”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5d90c7052e422b1b8f1bb91f71617f8ddfa4658/0_156_4783_2871/master/4783.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75e661b4ad80c8b4a1e7e8d7a68ff02b","title":"ministers split over coronavirus advice on wearing face masks","story":"Matt Hancock expresses scepticism about any change to UK-wide guidanceMinisters are split over whether to change government advice on wearing face masks, with Matt Hancock, the health secretary, stressing that the evidence for them was weak despite Scotland’s decision to recommend cloth coverings in some public places.Hancock expressed his scepticism about changing the UK-wide advice in the daily No 10 press conference on Tuesday, emphasising that physical distancing was a much greater priority.However, Whitehall sources said the discussion on the issue was still live among ministers, even though the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) presented its verdict on the issue to the cabinet almost a week ago, which is understood to have advised there was little evidence masks reduce the spread of infection in the community.One government source said there was still clear concern among some ministers about changing the UK advice at this stage, when people with symptoms are being advised to stay at home anyway.“There is a worry in government is that we don’t want to do anything to lessen the impact of masks for healthcare workers. The risk is that you end up with people in the NHS without masks. We are being very cautious about it. There are people in government who obviously are more and less enthusiastic about the idea,” the source said.However, some ministers are persuaded of the idea that people might feel more confident about going back to work if they are told to wear cloth coverings on public transport and in enclosed work spaces, which could help reopen the economy. The British Medical Association has also called on ministers to make wearing masks in public compulsory.The World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on face masks has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.\u0026nbsp“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO has stated.Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to prohibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.\u0026nbspThere is no robust scientific evidence – in the form of trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.Also underlying the WHO’s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play if everyone wears them.-\u0026nbspHow to make a non-medical coronavirus face mask – no sewing requiredOn Tuesday Nicola Sturgeon announced new non-mandatory guidance recommending that the Scottish public should wear face masks in enclosed spaces where social distancing is difficult to achieve, for example while shopping or using public transport.The Scottish first minister said she had taken advice from Sage, as well as her own chief medical officer, before making the decision to advise the use of masks “in limited circumstances”.Sturgeon said one of the reasons she had issued the guidance now was because people were increasingly wearing masks when they left the house and she did not want this to make iniduals feel “invincible’ or distract from adherence to existing physical distancing and stay-at-home guidance.She told reporters at her daily media briefing “all governments across the UK are considering this and it’s not for me to speak to them”, insisting there was no “ide or split” between them on the matter.Asked about the issue later at the No 10 press briefing, Hancock said: “UK government advice hasn’t changed, not least because the most important thing people can do is the social distancing, as opposed to the weak science on face masks.“There is very clear science on social distancing and the importance of it. That is the absolute priority in terms of the message to the public. The social distancing and staying at home is the thing that’s helping to save lives. That is the number one thing.”Professor Dame Angela McLean, the UK deputy chief scientific adviser, confirmed that Sage recommended that there was “weak evidence of a small effect in which a face mask can prevent a source of infection going from somebody who is infected to the people around them”.McLean said: “Under our current circumstances, anybody who has symptoms really must stay at home ... but we are also concerned that some people are infected who don’t have symptoms, or maybe don’t have symptoms yet, and that is the reason that Sage has put so much effort into looking at this question,” she said.“But the answer is clear that the evidence is weak and the effect is small, and we have passed that on to our colleagues in government with which to make a decision.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ad9c10c7c0eeea9f1a601249c3583ce77ac22a4/2470_21_2530_1518/master/2530.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c20d1de86e6637cccc867a157ea45989","title":"quiz how much do you know about the coronavirus","story":"You’ve been bombarded with information about the coronavirus for weeks - how much have you taken in?It has dominated global headlines for weeks, and you could be forgiven for feeling overwhelmed by the amount of information you’ve seen, heard and read about the coronavirus outbreak.

State media have not published a single photograph of Kim since, but they have carried reports of his daily routine, including diplomatic messages sent to other world leaders.Speculation that Kim was staying in Wonsan grew over the weekend after the Washington-based North Korea monitoring project 38 North said it had analysed satellite images showing his special train parked at the local station.On Tuesday, the NK News website said leisure boats often used by Kim had been active in the area throughout this month.North Korea sealed its border with China in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak, quarantined thousands of people and scaled down public events. Observers are sceptical, though, of the regime’s claims that the country is free of the virus.Edwin Salvador, the World Health Organization’s representative to North Korea, said last week that the country reported that it tested 740 people for Covid-19 as of 17 April but that all of them were negative. The North said it had so far released more than 25,000 people from quarantine since late December, according to Salvador.Jiro Ishimaru, who heads the Osaka-based Asia Press website and operates a network of citizen journalists in North Korea, said confirmation that Kim was in isolation would prove that the virus had spread inside the country.“I don’t think he is dead – if that was the case there would be a lot more identifiable movement,” Ishimaru, who has spoken recently to North Koreans near the Chinese border, told the . “One theory is that either he himself has the virus or people around him have it and he’s is sheltering.”Ishimaru said it was possible that the regime had deliberately sent Kim’s train to Wonsan – knowing satellite images would be seen by analysts – to give the impression that he was simple taking a break when, in fact, he was self-isolating elsewhere.“All of the attention is on Wonsan, but there is a chance that he is fooling everyone,” Ishimaru said.Chad O’Carroll, the chief executive of Korea Risk Group, which monitors North Korea, said any evidence that Kim was sheltering from the virus would “puncture a hole in the state media narrative of how this crisis has been perfectly managed”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fa524691be3e206c89ace0698932b0c2e17b12c/0_0_5536_3322/master/5536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c60f065762d3d74dc71b6a1b19f2d3d1","title":"was britain unprepared for a pandemic podcast","story":"As medics and carers report widespread shortages of protective equipment, the government is facing pressure to explain why it appears the UK went into a pandemic under-resourced.

Photograph: Leon FarrellPhotocall IrelandPA WireTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said the daily numbers of deaths, new cases and ICU patients associated with coronavirus suggest that the conditions are not yet suitable to lift the restrictions on commercial and social life. Restrictions imposed by the Government in an effort to stem the spread of the virus, also known as Covid-19, were introduced on March 28th and are due to last until at least May 5th. According to the latest figures from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), there have now been 1,159 Covid-19 related deaths in the Republic. The total number of confirmed cases in the State stands at 19,877.According to the NPHET, 153,054 tests for the disease have been carried out as of Monday. Over the past week, 41,470 tests were performed and of these 5,335 were positive, giving a positivity rate of 12.9 per cent.Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Varadkar said it was “totally incorrect” to say that restrictions were not yet being lifted because the testing capacity is not where it needs to be.“In terms of testing we’ve done 150,000 tests already. On a per capita basis, on a per head basis, we’re sixth out of 27 countries in the European Union in terms of testing. Why we are not reopening at this stage is because of the high number of people in ICU who have Covid, the fact that the number of deaths being reported every day is still very high and the fact that we’re still seeing quite a lot of new cases every day,” he said.“And if it were solely a matter of testing, given that we’re sixth out of 27 in the European Union, and other countries that have tested less than us are reopening, then we would be reopening.” Mr Varadkar said a number of factors had to be taken into account.“I don’t think I’d be out of school by saying that those numbers just aren’t good enough yet. Maybe it’ll change significantly by Friday. But as things stand, I don’t think we’re there yet.”On emerging Cabinet isions over the timing of the easing of restrictions, Mr Varadkar said he expected to hear different views from Ministers.“Any time you get 15 or 20 people in the room and ask for their views on something you’re going to have different views. And if I wasn’t hearing different views from my Ministers on any issue I would actually be quite worried because that would be a sign of groupthink or a sign that they are somehow afraid to express their opinions,” he said.“So what I did yesterday was something very simple, very straightforward: I asked each of them to give me two or three minutes on what their inidual views were on how to reopen the country and reopen the economy, and there was ersity of views and that’s what I wanted.”Dublin BusOn Wednesday, Government officials also said there has been a 3.5 per cent increase in the number of passengers using Dublin Bus.At the Government’s morning Covid-19 briefing, assistant secretary general at the Department of Taoiseach Liz Canavan said that on Tuesday of this week there were 57,858 journeys, an increase from the average in the previous three weeks where around 55,800 were using the service.Meanwhile Ms Canavan said that while there had been an increase in the number of patients attending normal appointments, she reiterated that it is “vital to attend the hospital as directed and to call emergency services in the event of incidents such as a heart attack or stroke.”In terms of business, she said more than 50,400 employers are now registered with Revenue temporary wage subsidy scheme.The cumulative value of payments made to employers under the scheme is now €652 million.Meanwhile, Prof Sam McConkey, associate professor and head of the department of international health and tropical medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), has said key financial and political decisions will need to be made by the Government. Prof McConkey called for a “look at reallocating staff” to essential services like health care, utilities, distribution networks. “We need to find some way of reallocating work, to get people reskilled for the new ways that we’re going to be working,” he said.“Our Government have listened to public health and medical experts and got us into this in a very robust and very effective and very prompt way, they haven’t dallied around waiting, they’ve been effective in taking unprecedented action rapidly,” he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland.“When we look at the total death rate in Ireland over the last four, six, seven weeks, and compare it to what it was one to five years ago, we find that there’s been very little change. That’s very different from Italy, Spain, particularly London and shockingly New York so I feel the last six to eight weeks have been largely a success.“That model of listening to technical experts has worked very well to get us into this, I don’t feel it will work particularly well to get us out of this because a lot of the key decisions are about getting the economy going again about asking how do we pay for this, about what businesses do we support, how do we support those businesses, do we nationalise them, do we do a grant, do we do a guarantee? And those are intrinsically financial and political decisions.”Prof McConkey said that he believed the whole of Irish society has been bearing the brunt of the restrictions, not just the over 70s. When asked if some restrictions should be lifted, he said: “I think the answer is yes that doing things outside while we’re two to three metres away, particularly if wearing masks, is completely safe.”Prof McConkey said: “Testing is really key, because inevitably the coronavirus is going start spreading again in Ireland either with reintroduction from outside or from small areas where it is still there, once it starts up in one area it’s particularly important that we detect that really quickly and effectively, when I say quickly, I mean within a few hours.”When asked if it was a case of “health versus wealth”, Prof McConkey replied: “I don’t think it is a case of pitting health against the economy because the strongest predictor of health in any society or any inidual or family is really their wealth, so unless we can get back to work to create value as iniduals and society and communities who won’t have the financial resources to provide basic things like medicine, like, food, like water, like nice housing, spacious housing, and the comfortable lives that allow us to have health.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4240749.1588154927!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"public may be advised to wear face coverings says varadkar","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar at Government Buildings, Dublin.

Some people will say it’s a good idea. Some people say it doesn’t make a difference. Some people say it’s a bad idea. So it’s not one of those straightforward decisions where the science tells you it’s the right thing to do or the wrong thing to do.“But there certainly is trend across the developed world to advise the public to wear face coverings in places where social distancing is difficult.”Mr Varadkar said this may be on public transport or in an enclosed indoor space.“We aware of what’s happening in Scotland and what’s happening in other countries in Europe, so that is another consideration. I think we will be in a position to offer revised advice the Irish public later in the week.“But because the science is so uncertain on this, because there isn’t agreement in the scientific community on this, it is not something we’d ever make compulsory, but it’s something that we may make advisory.”The deaths of another 59 patients diagnosed with Covid-19 were reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) at a briefing on Tuesday, of which 45 were laboratory-confirmed.The deaths occurred on 10 different days in the past fortnight, though most were in the last three days.

Photograph: @AreciboRadarTwitterPA Wire.An asteroid more than a mile wide will skim past Earth on Wednesday while travelling at a speed of around 19,000 miles per hour (30,578 kmh).The space rock, known as (52768) 1998 OR2, is expected to make its closest approach at 10.56am BST, when it will be just 3.9 million miles (6.3m km) away — around 16 times the distance between the Earth and the Moon.Although the asteroid is classified as a potentially hazardous object (PHO), scientists have said it will not put the planet at risk.Dr Brad Tucker, an astrophysicist at the Australian National University, said: “This asteroid poses no danger to the Earth and will not hit — it is one catastrophe we won’t have.“While it is big, it is still smaller than the asteroid that impacted the Earth and wiped out the dinosaurs.”He said an asteroid is classed as a PHO if it is bigger than 500ft and comes within five million miles of Earth’s orbit.Dr Anne Virkki, head of Planetary Radar at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, who has been tracking the 1.2 mile-wide rock, said understanding more about PHOs will help “improve impact-risk mitigation technologies”.At present, there are no known PHOs that pose an immediate danger to the Earth.The team, who began observations on April 13th, joked that the most recent pictures of the asteroid made it look as though it is wearing a mask.Dr Virkki said: “The small-scale topographic features such as hills and ridges on one end of asteroid 1998 OR2 are fascinating scientifically.“But, since we are all thinking about Covid-19, these features make it look like 1998 OR2 remembered to wear a mask.”Scientists will continue to monitor the asteroid, although the next closest approach is not expected to take place for another 49 years.Flaviane Venditti, a research scientist at the observatory, said: “The radar measurements allow us to know more precisely where the asteroid will be in the future, including its future close approaches to Earth.“In 2079, asteroid 1998 OR2 will pass Earth about 3.5 times closer than it will this year, so it is important to know its orbit precisely.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4239222.1588009981!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gove rejects eu request for mini embassy in belfast after brexit","story":"The British minister leading negotiations on the post-Brexit Northern Ireland protocol has rejected a European Union request for what he described as “a mini-embassy” in Belfast.

Photograph: House of CommonsPA WireThe British minister leading negotiations on the post-Brexit Northern Ireland protocol has rejected a European Union request for what he described as “a mini-embassy” in Belfast.The EU wants to open an office in Northern Ireland to monitor checks and controls on goods crossing the Irish Sea after the end of the current transition period.But Michael Gove told a committee of MPs that Britain saw no reason for any permanent presence for the EU apart from its delegation’s headquarters in London.“Of course it is the case that the EU has the right to monitor the operation of what UK officials are doing but there’s no need for there to be a mini-embassy in Belfast in order for that to happen,” he told the House of Commons committee on the future relationship with the EU.In a letter to the European Commission, paymaster general Penny Mordaunt said any necessary monitoring could be carried out by means of ad hoc visits by EU officials to the North.Under the protocol, goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to EU customs controls unless they are explicitly exempt.Delicate balanceThe two sides agreed that checks should be carried out by the British authorities but that EU officials could monitor how they are implemented.“The proposition of a permanent EU office, with permanent staff whose primary purpose (as you acknowledge) would be to engage in a form of supervision of UK implementation of the protocol, is not consistent with the delicate balance of rights and responsibilities, on both parties, set out in the protocol,” Ms Mordaunt said.“Second, one of the primary purposes of the protocol is the protection of the BelfastGood Friday Agreement in all its dimensions. We must therefore aim to implement it in a way that is acceptable to both communities in Northern Ireland and mitigates its effects on them. Both the EU and the UK face obligations in this regard and both sides must make special efforts to develop reasonable proposals in implementing the protocol. A special EU office, uniquely in the regions and nations of the UK, in order to implement a protocol that has attracted controversy, would in our view be isive in political and community terms.”Mr Gove was pressed on what steps his government was taking to prepare ports on either side of the Irish Sea for the customs checks that will be required under the protocol. But he insisted that “the\u0026nbspprecise nature of how the protocol will be implemented” will be determined in a specialised British-EU committee which holds its next meeting on Thursday.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

We don\u0027t want the health system to be overwhelmed. We don\u0027t want more people to die from Covid 19,” said Prof Lothar Wieler of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s infectious disease centre. “We must stick to the contact restrictions, keep at least 1.5 m apart and cover our mouths and noses on public transport and in shops,” he appealed to the public.Angela Merkel identified the reproduction factor, also known as R0, as a crucial factor in deciding to lift Germany’s lockdown, and government scientists have declared keeping it below 1 as a key target.But Prof Wieler downplayed the brief rise, which he said was within normal fluctuation rates. The total number of infections in Germany has fallen over recent days, he stressed.  “It is important not to take the number out of context, because the reproduction factor does not tell you the actual number of infections,” he said.In what was seen as a major success in the fight against coronavirus, the German reproduction factor fell to 0.7 last week. Since then it has generally been steady at around 0.9.Germany began to lift its lockdown last week as shops were allowed to reopen. Mrs Merkel has publicly criticised Germany’s regional governments for lifting lockdown measures too quickly, but government scientists said it is too early for this to have caused the brief rise in the reproduction factor.The figure is based on forecast estimates of infection rates because there is a lag of 10-14 days in new infections being detected.There is speculation in Germany the rise may have been caused by people socialising over Easter weekend.But Prof Wieler stressed the actual rise was very small. The R0 only reached 0.96 on Monday but the figure was rounded up to the nearest decimal place.Separately, Germany could introduce tickets for access to shopping areas to prevent overcrowding under proposals reportedly put forward by business leaders.The German Chamber of Commerce and Industry has reportedly submitted proposals for an app-based system that would issue timed tickets for people to enter pedestrianised shopping streets, shopping centres and hotels.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"map shows testing blackspots uk","story":"More than a million people in the UK live over an hour from their nearest coronavirus testing centre, new  analysis has revealed.Some of the worst areas for connectivity to a regional testing centre are Norfolk, Cornwall, North Wales and the Scottish Borders. Some 43 regional testing centres were available for the public on 28 April, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. Fifteen of these have opened in the last week, as the Government scrambled to hit its aim of having 48 open by the end of April.The drive-through network aims to provide thousands of swab tests for critical key workers, to identify if they currently have coronavirus.But using road travel times from the TravelTime mapping service, analysis shows that these testing centres leave vast areas of Wales, Scotland, East of England and the South West without significant coverage. In addition to these regional testing centres, the Department of Health and Social Care said there were a further 16 satellite testing centres to detect coronavirus. At least half of these are healthcare facilities which have particularly urgent need for test kits.The department also plans for 11 mobile testing centres - based at Nottingham, Wembley, Gateshead, Leeds, Manchester, Gatwick, Plymouth, Edgbaston, Stansted Airport, Preston and Bristol - to provide further cover, along with home-testing kits.None of these satellite testing centres or planned mobile testing centres tackle the under-represented areas of Norfolk, North Wales or the Scottish Borders. Experts have warned that testing capacity has to be increased across the country in order to lift the lockdown. Professor Karol Sikora, a private oncologist and Dean of Medicine at the University of Buckingham, told The : “\u0027There is no question - we were far too slow off the mark with testing which was not helped by a lack of pre-existing infrastructure.“We can\u0027t fight this virus blind, we need to follow South Korea and Germany\u0027s lead and use testing to hunt the virus down.“There are logistical issues. Getting these tests to the people that need them is challenging. Embracing spare capacity in private labs could help solve this problem.”The worst areas for connectivity are Cornwall and Norwich, home to large populations and yet more than an hour’s drive from a test centre. Some 200,000 people live in Norwich alone, living over an hour from their closest testing centre at the Copdock Park and Ride in Ipswich. Likewise, the Tipner Lorry Park in Portsmouth opened on 21 April - but this is still more than an hour\u0027s drive from Cornish population hubs such as Truro and Newquay.There is no regional testing centre on the Isle of Wight.The Government has been criticised for its slow increase in testing across the UK, with it looking unlikely to hit its own 100,000-a-day coronavirus testing target.Figures show 29,000 tests were carried out in the latest 24-hour period of data available to the government. This does not include tests carried out over the weekend.A Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Our aim as we tackle this virus is to make it easy, fast and simple for any essential worker who needs a test, to get a test.“In addition to setting up a nationwide network of drive in testing sites, we have introduced home testing kit delivery, deployed mobile testing units operated by the Armed Forces, and built three new ‘mega labs’ to analyse test samples.“This is in addition to more than doubling the capacity of the NHS and Public Health England laboratories, all in a matter of weeks. 569,768 people have now been tested in the UK, and the vast majority report no issues with the process. We are determined to ensure that everyone who needs a test can get one.”The standard international test for coronavirus is quantitative, making it relatively easy to measure how much virus they are making - known as the \u0027viral load\u0027. This could be crucial in determining not only how infectious a person is, but also how dangerous their passing on coronavirus can be.In order to calculate the numbers behind this story, the Department of Health and Social Care provided us with a list of regional testing sites as of 27 April 2020. We then geo-located each site. Then, we used the TravelTime mapping service to generate shapes of areas within a 30-minute off-peak drive of each regional testing site. Anything that fell outside of these merged areas was further than a 30 minute drive from a regional testing site. This was then overlaid with population density data to be able to reveal population hotspots with limited access to regional testing sites.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"government wants schools reopened safely phased way","story":"Schools will have a “phased” re-opening, the education secretary has said as he warns that it would not be practical for all students to return at once.Gavin Williamson reiterated that there is no date set for schools to reopen, but revealed that he has asked the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to set up a sub-group to examine how it can be done in a safe way.Speaking to MPs on the education select committee, he said that he is already in talks with headteachers about how schools can reopen in a “logical” and “sensible” way.Mr Williamson said there are no plans to run schools through the summer, adding that when schools do reopen, it will be in a phased way.We recognise the idea of schools all returning on day one with the full complement of pupils is not practical, he told MPs.He declined to specify which year groups should be the first to return to school, but headteachers have previously suggested that current Year 10 and Year 12 students who are in the middle of their GCSE and A-level courses should be prioritised.Mr Williamson said that Government officials are keeping an eye on developments in other countries, such as Denmark and Germany, where schools have started to reopen.He said that while different countries have different education systems so they are not directly comparable, he wants to make sure that lessons are learned from what is done elsewhere.Ministers have come under pressure to announce a timeline on English schools reopening, which is seen by some as holding the key to ending lockdown since it would enable parents to go back to work.Mr Williamson has previously said that schools will not return until the Government\u0027s five tests for lifting lockdown are met, including the death rate consistently falling, that the NHS\u0027s ability to cope has been protected and that any changes do not risk a second peak.Earlier this week, the Welsh education minister confirmed that schools will reopen after lockdown in a “phased” way with only certain year groups returning at a time.Kirsty Williams, the Welsh Government’s education minister, outlined plans for schools to resume operations, explaining that they will “not immediately return to operating at full capacity”.  John Swinney, Scotland\u0027s Education Minister and Deputy First Minister, said on Tuesday that it is  “inconceivable” that the entire pupil population will return to school “in one go”.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown end exit strategy uk options","story":"1) Evidence that the NHS can cope across the UK 2) A sustained fall in daily death rates 3) Evidence that the rate of infection is decreasing 4) Confidence that supplies of testing and PPE are able to meet demand 5) No risk of a second peakThe first four have either been met or are close to being met. The fifth hurdle, which ministers have always said is the most important, was originally designed to entirely avoid a second peak. Prof Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, has warned the lockdown would not come to a quick end,  with some restrictions in place for a year. He said ministers would have to consider “trade-offs” to avoid a second wave of coronavirus, which a key government scientific adviser warned was likely.For example, social distancing could be alternated on a regional basis to give people a rest from draconian restrictions. The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), has proposed that parts of the country could enjoy greater freedoms for six months at a time, before returning to lockdown.Many experts agree that mass gatherings should still be avoided.“We don\u0027t know for sure which are the measures that will result in a successful exit strategy, Michael Ryan, Chief Executive Director of the World Health Organisation Health Emergencies Programme said on April 27 at a WHO briefing in Geneva. Germany, which is carrying out hundreds of thousands of tests, is planning to give certificates to citizens. It was hoped that antibody tests would help kickstart the economy by allowing those who are immune out of lockdown.However this route is currently being hampered because supplies from China have so far failed to pass sensitivity and specificity tests.  Early surveillance tests carried out by government researchers at Porton Down also appeared to show that nobody had the virus in the community, which is likely to be a problem with the test rather than an indication that people are not infected.Professor Karol Sikora, a private oncologist and Dean of Medicine at the University of Buckingham, has carried out his own antibody tests and believes and found an infection rate of around six per cent. However he believes antibody tests will not be useful in the long-term because under-40s who definitely had the virus were coming back negative, suggesting it may not be useful for the wider population. Prof Skiora, said: “I think the antibody tests do work, but young people just don’t seem to have the antibodies, which suggests they are using other mechanisms to fight off the virus. “We’re not picking it up in young people so politicians may not be able to issue certificates of immunity. “I don’t think it will be a good tool for unleashing lockdown.”On April 23, the UK joined the US – which currently has two studies – and China, in beginning human trials for a vaccine. However, the Prime Minister and his cabinet say they believe that a preventative jab is unlikely to be forthcoming in this calendar year.If a working cure does become available in the coming weeks or months then lockdown will be lifted far sooner.Imperial College has continually warned that restrictions and widespread monitoring would have to stay in place until a vaccine was available, to prevent a second wave. Yet scaling up will present a problem and it is likely that only frontline workers will be given vaccines initially leaving Dr Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government’s Sage group and the Director of the Wellcome Trust said the disease would not be going away anytime soon and future waves were likely.“My belief is that this is now an endemic human infection. It is likely that this is here with the human race for the future. We’re going to have to find ways to deal with that.“The real moving forward is we have to have new tests, we have to have drugs that treat this infection, and critically we need to have vaccines so we can prevent what we should assume are future waves.”Countries that have lifted some areas of lockdown, such as Germany, have started to see the reproduction rate rise again, and fear they may have to reimpose restrictions to avoid a second wave.Angela Merkel has warned that hospitals could be overwhelmed by the end of June if the numbers continue to rise,  and said a second “shutdown” would be unavoidable if the cases did not start to decline.If the lockdown had been instigated one or two weeks earlier, once we knew we were subject to community spread, is it possible to model how much time we would have needed in lockdown and how many infections we would have prevented?The strategy for the fight of Covid-19 has been focused towards saving the NHS from failing due to over demand exceeding capacity. How does the model of an earlier lockdown impact on the NHS?Does an earlier lockdown merely prolong the length of the epidemic by slowing the acquisition of herd immunity?Here\u0027s what Sarah has to say:However, one of the reasons to delay a lockdown was to flatten the projected peak rather than squash it entirely as if we did that, we will see another huge peak once we emerge as nobody will have immunity. This way, by the time we get out, a large number of people will probably have already had the virus, and a second peak will be far lower.It seems that part of the reason why no objective economic analysis of the costs and benefits of Coronavirus policy has been conducted is a reluctance to inform people of the full extent of the worst case scenario.Therefore I would like to ask why the full worse case scenario has not been properly communicated?Hi Roger, yes good question. I keep asking the government this and I am told The Treasury is modelling it so hopefully we should now soon. Many people in government are now concerned that the economic, social and health impact of lockdown will be far worse than the benefit. Yesterday Chris Whitty the Chief Medical Officer spoke about the ‘unintended consequences’ of erting so many NHS resources to fighting coronavirus. We know that many operations and treatments are being cancelled and the fall-out from that could be tremendous. I do fear the cure will prove worse than the disease in the long term.We have been aware that coronavirus had originally mutated to two strains, nasty and very nasty. This morning on Radio 5 Live a virologist admitted that it has now mutated many more times. So as a result has making a vaccine become much harder and immunity is now a toss up due to the strength of the variations? Also, given the mutations, will immunity be short lived and we might regretfully see many more waves of the virus? In this case, blood plasma, with all its risks maybe the route forward?Here\u0027s what Sarah has to say:Hi John. Yes mutations can make it tricky to make a vaccine. It depends on where the mutation has happened. Many vaccines in production grab on to the ‘spike protein’ on the surface of coronavirus - it looks like a little rod with a small crown on top, hence the name ‘corona’ - If the DNA mutated to alter that structure then it would hamper vaccine development. But other vaccines are using different mechanisms.Blood plasma is looking pretty good so far, and there are also trials ongoing which use the T-cells of healthy people to ramp up the immune system. These aren’t targeting a specific virus so if it mutated it wouldn’t matter.Is the situation getting much better now that we’re under lockdown?Sarah has the following to say:Hi Mitch, yes it appears to be although it is early days. The number of new admissions to hospital is falling and that will mean that death rates should also begin to fall soon. We’re expecting a death rate peak at around Easter Sunday or a few days later. If we follow how China progressed after that we should start to see rapid declines and could be thinking about an exit strategy sometime around mid-May.Our next question from a reader who\u0027d like to remain anonymous:While the lockdown is in place will the strictness of the lockdown stay the same as it is now or get stricter?Here\u0027s what Sarah has to say:Hi. The government is keen not to impose a stricter lockdown and at the moment it is looking unlikely. Case numbers appear to be stabilising and if we peak when expected - in the next week or so - then there will be no need as it will be clear the lockdown is working.Modelling shows we only need 75 per cent compliance for it to be effective and we are well above that. Katrina Allen has asked the all-important question:How long will the UK be under lockdown?Hi Katrina, nobody quite knows at the moment and the government is waiting for deaths to peak before deciding on an exit strategy or timeline. However if the virus peaks in Britain when expected - by Easter Sunday or a little after - then lockdown could be lifted in May. China began lifting restrictions around a month after their cases peaked, and they seem to now have the situation under control. Ministers and scientists are watching other countries closely at the moment and what happens elsewhere will help inform our own exit strategy.At the beginning of May or such time that the daily death rate falls below 150 then remove lockdown for people below the age of 45 providing they do not live with someone who is above the age of 60. There may be a case for continuing the lockdown in central London for a further two or three weeks beyond the rest of the country.Here\u0027s what Sarah has to say:Hi! Yes I think the government is probably planning a phased exit where less vulnerable members of society are allowed out of lockdown earlier. Paradoxically, London might get out sooner than the rest of the country as there is emerging evidence that the capital has built up more immunity. I suspect there will be a general lockdown release in May and then some areas will be asked to go back in, if it looks like the virus is getting out of control in specific areas.Perhaps the time has come to move the approach to the crisis away from the hospitals ( where they themselves will admit it is very hard to eliminate infections) to other sectors such as manufacturing which have developed sterile and aseptic techniques for their product manufacture which could be used to create virus-proof cocoons  for the elderly and other vulnerable groups until medical science develops effective drug treatment?Here are Sarah\u0027s thoughts on the matter:Hi Edward.  As long as older and vulnerable people are isolating themselves I don’t think we will need to go that far, although it’s a very interesting idea.Stephen Keay asks: What is wrong with using chloroquine as a first line treatment?Here\u0027s what Sarah has to say: Anti-virals usually need to be given early in an infection and we know that coronavirus is asymptomatic for a while so they might not be as useful as they first appear. Oxford University is currently carrying out trials in coronavirus patients using hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritomavir - and HIV treatment - and dexamethasone - a type of steroid, and results should be known soon. Red tape is being removed so once deemed safe and effective they could be rolled out fairly quickly.Geoff Doven asks: When the world gets back to normal and overseas holidays are back on the agenda, would it be safe for those of a vulnerable age to be able to travel prior to having an anti-virus vaccination?From Sarah: Hi Geoff - I would advise keeping an eye on Foreign Office advice on this as it is changing rapidly. In coming weeks I imagine that the Department of Health will also be issuing some guidance on what vulnerable people should be doing in terms of travel or just generally moving about. It looks like vulnerable people may be isolated for longer in any event, which means that by the time you get out of lockdown, the world is likely to be a much safer place, and a vaccine or treatment could be available. Maybe avoid cruise ships and crowded resorts for a while though!John Crone says: My wife and I are well into our 80\u0027s and (though not in the medically vulnerable category) are bound to be at high risk until a vaccine appears.As lockdown progresses in the meantime, it seems to me that the likes of us could emerge from self isolation if provided with PPE - quality masks.  Plus of course observing hand hygiene.Sarah: Hi John! There doesn’t seem to be much evidence that masks prevent people becoming infected although it does seem that they stop infected people spreading the disease further.I think that by the time lockdown is removed - which could be later for the most vulnerable - the virus will have hugely diminished in the community and the risk of infection will be very low. So as long as you keep up your good hygiene practices, and social distancing, I don’t think a mask will be necessary. It’s worth noting that there is no evidence yet that coronavirus has ever been transmitted outdoors, but lots of evidence of indoor transmission. Susan Killion asks: Why is it so hard for the US to get testing out to all the population in order to isolate positives and negatives and ultimately get rid of the virus?From Sarah: Hi Susan, I think a lot of countries are struggling with ramping up testing because of a lack of material needed for testing. The tests require two enzymes which are usually only produced on a small scale.  Normally, demand is very steady and relatively low, so scaling up to the massive quantities of global demand takes time.  In addition, quality control checks must be carried out to minimise the risk of false positivenegatives. A bad test is worse than no test at all as it might allow someone into the community who is infected. Governments have also struggled to get hold of the swabs needed for the tests as huge numbers are produced in Lombardy, Italy, which is currently locked down.But yes, testing is crucial, and it’s vital that countries get hold of more tests.It\u0027s the million dollar question! Sarah: Hi Charlotte. If we follow what China has done we could expect restrictions to end around a month after the epidemic peaks. The government is expecting that in the next week or so so probably six weeks from now is looking like a likely exit date. But that would change if the trajectory of the epidemic alters. Sarah: Northern Ireland seems to be on a similar trajectory to the UK and with Health Minister Robin Swann warning the public that the worst is yet to come so it will be another few weeks after the peak before lockdown is lifted  This is a fun one but also a very interesting point (sorry, gents). Sarah says: Hi Laura. Yes you’re right that infection and death rates seem to be far higher for men than women - around three times higher in some cases. I think it is a really interesting and quite sensible suggestion, but I suspect it might be a politically unpopular move to only allow women out. Might cause a riot!This is pretty wild, but a valid point nonetheless. Sarah: Hi Mark, yes there is always the possibility that some people may try to catch the virus to get out early, but given that it is indiscriminately deadly, I would hope most people would be more sensible.Wouldn\u0027t it make far more sense to just isolate the elderly and vulnerable, and perhaps continue to be able to afford a National Health Service?Sarah: Hi. The case numbers have gone down because of the lockdown. The original modelling was largely based on allowing the virus to sweep through the population. Although the virus is disproportionately impacting the elderly and vulnerable it is killing younger people too so it’s probably better to keep everyone inside until case numbers are far lower.It would be a nightmare of epic proportions for privacy watchdogs.... but, could allow us to resume normal life, which itself would be worth billions to the economy, a lot to our sanity, and test the system\u0027s effectiveness for future pandemics.The Government has already said that its app will be voluntary but is hoping that large numbers of people will download it. A survey out today suggests 78 per cent of people would give up some privacy to help tackle the virus. But I don’t think that would be needed in this instance. All data will be anonymous and will vanish after 14 days. It will be up to people to do the right thing and self-isolate rather than being made to or forced to download the app.Chris Wichard says: Hi Sarah, you may or may not have any particular opinion of or insight into this, but do you have any view as to whether GDPR concerns may inhibit the effective roll out of contact tracing apps?Hi Chris. The Government is working with civil rights groups to make sure data is anonymised. The NHS has promised it will not be using it to track people but to alert them if they come into contact with someone who then tests positive with coronavirus so they can do the right thing. It will be entirely voluntary. Officials are anxious not to allow other countries or companies to have access to the data of British citizens, which is why we are developing our own anonymised version in line with other countries including Norway, and Germany.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 29th april 2020","story":"A selection of the 125,000 birthday cards that have been sent to Captain Tom Moore, for his 100th birthday displayed in the Great Hall of Bedford School. 99-year-old Moore captured the hearts of the UK after initially setting out to raise just £1,000 for the NHS following the novel coronavirus outbreak, by walking 100 laps of his 25-metre garden. He has gone on to brake the record for raising the most money in an inidual charity walk, more than £27 millionCoronavirus latest news: Deaths in Scottish care homes overtake those in hospitalsBoris Johnson baby name odds: what will Carrie and the PM call their son?Watch PMQS live as Dominic Raab deputises for new father Boris JohnsonComment: Wokism is breaking out again.

A day after the press conference, Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, gave a television interview suggesting 60 per cent of people would need to become infected to protect the population. Yet after Imperial College modelling suggested such a mitigation strategy could result in 250,000 deaths, the Government made a rapid volte face, imposing strict social distancing measures and closing businesses and schools on March 23.The impact of such extreme suppression means a second peak, far higher than the first, is now a near certainty – and that has major implications for how Britain must exit the lockdown if such a catastrophe is to be avoided.  “The second wave is in our hands,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organisation (WHO) on April 27.Here is what we know about a second wave and how it impacts the future:The two peaksIn the first graphs shown by Mr Johnson in March, squashing the sombrero would cause the first peak to come towards the end of May. The rounded peak appeared to be about half the size of that expected if the disease was left to run rampant through the population.Squashing the sombreroUnder that scenario, the NHS would be able to cope and the virus would not present a problem later in the year. Sir Patrick told journalists: We want to… not suppress it so we get the second peak and also allow enough of us who are going to get mild illness to become immune to this to help with the sort of whole population response, which would protect everybody.However, under the current suppression plan, the trajectory of the disease has changed dramatically, with the peak moving to the middle of December. Alarmingly, it appears every bit as high and deadly as the unmitigated wave the Government was so keen to avoid. Are we headed for second wave of virusAlthough experts believe we have now peaked in the first wave, that is actually only a very low level of what could happen if lockdown is lifted without any means to suppress a second, far more deadly wave.  The Chief Medical Officer has admitted the Easter weekend peak was \u0027artificial\u0027 brought about by lockdown measures. Professor Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College, who led the modelling and sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said: There is almost no herd immunity and a very large risk of a second peak if we relax current measures without something to put in their place.Avoiding a second wave is one of the government\u0027s five tests that must be met before ministers will consider lifting any restrictions. The first four have either been met or are close to being met. The fifth hurdle, which ministers have always said is the most important, was originally designed to entirely avoid a second peak. But on April 28th, the wording was changed to say the aim was to avoid a second peak that overwhelms the NHS  making it easier for ministers to say the test had been met. It appears that government has now accepted that a second peak is inevitable and, if Britain is ever to get out of lockdown, it will need to be mitigated against, rather than suppressed entirely.The large amount of extra capacity created by the new Nightingale Hospitals is also believed to be in anticipation of a second peak later in the year, when the NHS will also be coping with flu season.One of the problems of Britain\u0027s lockdown strategy is just how effective it has been. Suppression modelling was based on all households reducing contact outside the household, school or workplace by up to 75 per cent. Workplace contact rates were to reduce by 25 per cent. On April 13, the Government released its first graphs showing how the public was complying with the lockdown. Workplaces were down 54 per cent, and retail and recreation down 85 per cent.Likewise, people appear to be doing better at self-isolating than was expected. It was assumed that just 70 per cent of people with symptoms of coronavirus would stay at home as instructed, but research by health experts Evergreen Life showed that, in most areas of Britain, more than 90 per cent are complying and even in the worst areas 75 per cent are still staying put.Although the modelling predicted that all schools would shut, it assumed 25 per cent of universities would remain open.Data published by the Department for Education this week showed that less than one per cent of children are going to school every day despite estimates from ministers that the amount would be up to 20 per cent. Likewise, it was thought that 50 per cent of people diagnosed with coronavirus would stay in quarantine for 14 days. Yet there is little evidence of people breaking quarantine, and powers of arrest have now been given to police to stop it from happening.A small study from the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found people had cut contacts by around 73 per cent, roughly in line with Government expectations.While such compliance has been excellent at keeping the virus under control, leading to a noticeable downturn in cases in recent weeks, it means few people are building up immunity.In the critical Imperial Paper, published on March 16, scientists warned that once restrictions were relaxed infections would inevitably begin to rise again and the bounce-back would be far worse if suppression was too extreme.The more successful a strategy is at temporary suppression, the larger the later epidemic is predicted to be, in the absence of vaccination, due to lesser build-up of herd immunity, the researchers warned.Experts on the Government\u0027s Sage committee now believe that only about five per cent of the population has been infected with the disease and that there is almost no herd immunity in Britain.Under the Government’s mitigation strategy, the reproduction, or R number, would reduce dramatically, but not to below one, so cases would rise, but only slowly, until hitting a peak.Under the suppression strategy, the reproduction rate falls from around 2.6 to below one and the virus dies away. But reducing infections now can store up problems for the future. The Government is carrying out a testing programme to determine how many people in Britain have recovered from the disease and work out current immunity level, but so far it has not published the findings.Several studies have now put it at roughly six per cent, and new results this week from the The Pasteur Institute show just 5.7 per cent of people in France will have contracted coronavirus by the time the country starts lifting lockdown next month.The institute researchers warned of the high risk of a second wave unless drastic social distancing is maintained.Social Distancing - Why it is CrucialKarol Skiora, a private oncologist and Dean of Medicine at the University of Buckingham, has been carrying out his own antibody testing and believes that between eight to 10 per cent of people are likely to have had coronavirus so far. We\u0027re nowhere near herd immunity, he said. We could definitely have a second peak. It is a real worry.Waiting for a vaccineImperial College predicted that strict lockdown measures would be needed for at least five months, but also warned that restrictions and widespread monitoring would have to stay in place until a vaccine was available in order to prevent a second wave. Dozens of research labs across the globe are working on vaccines and a team at Oxford believe they could have a viable jab ready by the autumn. Yet scaling up will present a problem and it is likely that only frontline workers will be given vaccines initially, leaving the general public waiting until at least next year. That delay means restrictions such as social distancing will be in place for many months to come. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the Sage group and the director of the Wellcome Trust, said the virus would not be going away any time soon and future waves were likely.Covid-19: Treatment and preventionWe must assume and prepare for the fact that this is not a discrete one-off episode, he said. My belief is that this is now an endemic human infection. It is likely that this is here with the human race for the future. We\u0027re going to have to find ways to deal with that.The real moving forward is we have to have new tests, we have to have drugs that treat this infection, and critically we need to have vaccines so we can prevent what we should assume are future waves.On April 23, Professor Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, told Britons to prepare for another year of “disruptive” social distancing measures and warned that lockdown would not come to a quick end. He said ministers would have to consider “trade-offs” and decide the “optimal combination” of social distancing measures to control the virus until a vaccine became available.Prof Whitty  has said the “exit” from the lockdown “in the long run” would come through either a vaccine or “highly effective drugs” that would prevent deaths.In recent weeks, journalists have questioned why the Government is continuing to invest in huge numbers of intensive care beds at Nightingale hospitals while cases are on the decline.At the peak of the epidemic over the Easter weekend, the new 4,000-bed NHS Nightingale hospital in east London treated just 19 patients.NHS chief in the north-east of England predicted that the Nightingale hospital under construction there is unlikely to be needed.So why build them at all? A second peak is likely to be the reason.While the current epidemic appears to have stabilised below 1,000 cases a day, modelling of a second wave suggests that it could be far higher if it is not brought under control through mass testing, contact tracing and isolation after lockdown.Asked whether the Nightingale hospitals were being kept for a possible second wave, a Downing Street spokesman said: I am certainly not aware of any plans to stand down these Nightingale hospitals, and some are still being built.Fears of a second coronavirus wave have made governments around the world nervous about lifting their lockdowns too early and too quickly, and Britain is no exception.A safety net of widespread testing, contact tracing and isolation of those infected must be in place to ensure cases are not allowed to rise, while squashing the sombrero of a second peak may now be a viable option.Ilan Kelman, professor of disasters and health at University College London said: A second peak of infection could be manageable if we protect those who are vulnerable, treat those who get sick, do not reduce other medical services and meet all healthcare worker needs. Another possible strategy is a staged stand-down of lockdown to flatten a second peak, provided that those who are told to remain in lockdown, or who cannot work because of it, are given all the support they need to avoid difficult effects of being isolated while others resume life.In China, a spike in infections after weeks of falling rates has forced the authorities to impose new restrictions. In the north-eastern city of Harbin, a 22-year-old university student who returned from the US was identified as the source of more than 40 new infections, while Chinese citizens returning from Siberia via the border town of Suifenhe led to more than 400 confirmed new cases.The examples show the huge problem in restarting life again after a strict lockdown when so few of the population are immune. In Germany, credited with keeping its outbreak under tight control through its use of extensive testing and contact tracing, there has been a rise in deaths as the country was re-opening some small shops and preparing for children to return to school from May 4.Angela Merkel, the Chancellor, has warned that reimposing lockdown will be inevitable if the infection rate continues to rise. Modelling has also shown that a second wave of cases might occur in the northern hemisphere in mid-summer.The director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned on Tuesday that any second wave of coronavirus was likely to be even more serious if it coincided with the start of flu season.Robert Redfield told The Washington Post: There\u0027s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through.On April 27, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said governments easing lockdown restrictions were now facing a new challenge, how to prevent a rebound in transmissionMichael Ryan, Chief Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme told a briefing in Geneva: I think it\u0027s very logical that if you lift that pressure too quickly, the virus can jump back.We don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to happen in two, three, four or five months when we may see a reemergence of the disease.“Nothing is certain. That\u0027s why we\u0027re watching very closely each and every country to see what lessons are being learned and we will ensure that those lessons are shared between countries.In Britain, the Government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) are reporting to ministers regularly and the lockdown due to be reviewed by May 7.Leave your questions in the comments section at the bottom of this article.

A living which gives a man or a woman not only enough to live by, but something to live for.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe 70-year-old continued: “Now the current pandemic has laid bare the inequalities in wealth and in health that plague our nation.“In Michigan, hard-hit by the coronavirus, African-Americans make up 14 per cent of the population but 40 per cent of the deaths from this disease. So many disenfranchised Americans lack the essential liberty to protect their own lives, and the lives of their families.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus Podcast“This pandemic has shown the great ide between our American dream and American reality, between current America versus the ideals enshrined in our founding documents.”He added: “All I know is, here in the beginning of the 21st century, in Paterson and other New Jersey cities, in Michigan, in rural America, and all across the United States, this reality is so frustrating that, as the great Marvin Gaye said, we should want to holler.”After finishing the speech which draws heavily from a New York Times article, Springsteen went on to play Gaye’s ‘Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler).’Earlier in the show, Springsteen stressed the need for kindness as a way of overcoming the pandemic.“I’ve lived in the United States for 70 years now, and I have to admit I’ve often been disappointed in our failure to live up to our ideals.“But I also have to say, I’ve never really been able to deny that there’s a promise that constantly resides in the American people, that could make us the great democratic nation that we carry in our hearts and in our dreams. ”He added: “And if we put our hearts and our lives together and fought for the very ideals, those of equality, of liberty, of social justice, of compassion for our neighbours, we would find that this is where our strength resides. And we have it within in our power to create the kind of humane society we’ve always dreamt of.“Now, all of this sounds corny when you say it. But it ain’t corny when you do it.”Other tunes played by Springsteen in the show included his own “New York City Serenade”, Tupac Shakur’s “Dear Mama” and a cover of “The Promised Land” by Nashville’s Blacklist Royals.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I admire him so much, he’s one of my favourite actors, but I remember walking out feeling kind of shaken that he had gone after me in a way that was completely weirdly uncalled for.”Speaking to Washington in 2004 during promotion for his political thriller The Manchurian Candidate, Couric asked the Oscar winner if he agreed with the claim that “Hollywood folks should stick to acting”.“I don’t know what Hollywood folks are, first of all,” Washington replied. “Hollywood is a town that has some stars on the sidewalk. I don’t know anybody from there … That’s like calling you a ‘type’ of folks. I’m not a Hollywood folk. I don’t know who they are.”Bollywood icon and Life of Pi actor Irrfan Khan dies aged 53How The Simpsons made Sideshow Bob into one of TV’s favourite villains“OK, all right, well, let me rephrase the question,” Couric said. “Are you one of those people that – ”Washington then interrupted, saying: “Ah, there you go. ‘Am I one of those people?’ Hmmm, isn’t that interesting?”After Couric attempted to explain her question, Washington said: “No, don’t stop. I heard what you just said. ‘Am I one of those people?’ No, I’m not.”Couric rephrased her question again, asking, “Are you an actor who would rather not – ”, but Washington interrupted her again.“No, I’m not that either,” Washington said. “I’m a human being. My job is acting.”Couric told Pellegrino that Washington later “wrote a big cheque” to her colon cancer foundation, potentially as an apology, adding: “I think he must have been having a really bad day.”In The Manchurian Candidate, which also starred Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber, Washington played a war veteran who discovers that US soldiers are being brainwashed by the government.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Users will be able to filter Peloton\u0027s huge leaderboard – which can include tens of thousands of people –\u0026nbspdown to just the people they know from a given group.The feature was built to respond to the fact that many Peloton users have already formed their own on other social networks, David Packles, Peloton\u0027s director of product, told\u0026nbspThe Independent. Groups have formed around a whole range of different things, with communities of people representing everything from specific ways of working out to different body types.Many of those groups already represent themselves by adding hashtags into their usernames or the field that usually displays a person\u0027s location. The new feature was built to respond to that unintended usage to give people a more organised way of keeping up with the people they follow, Mr Packles said.Mr Packles said he was expecting that people would use the new group feature similarly, potentially in a variety of ways that Peloton had not been able to anticipate. But the company has installed a variety of algorithms and other systems that watch to ensure the new feature cannot be used abusively or maliciously, he said.While the feature comes as people are stuck at home because of the coronavirus pandemic, Mr Packles confirmed that the app has been in development for many, many months, and was not specifically launched because of recent events. New features would usually have been announced at Peloton\u0027s annual Homecoming event the coming weekend, but that has been cancelled this year because of the outbreak.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

The company said that was not arriving in the latest update.It also said there would be no changes to its chat feature, which currently allows people to talk to each other through video calls while they are on the bike. That is still limited to one-to-one calls, at least for the time being.Peloton is far from the only app adding new group features amid lockdowns around the world. Cycling training app Trainer Road, for instance, recently rolled out group workouts that allow a variety of users to do the same exercise while talking to each other over built-in group video chat.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On a normal day we would fly more than 300. What we are facing as an airline, like so many other businesses up and down the country, is that there is no ‘normal’ any longer.“Our very limited flying schedule means that revenues are not coming into our business.\u0026nbsp“In the last few weeks, the outlook for the aviation industry has worsened further and we must take action now. We are a strong, well-managed business that has faced into, and overcome, many crises in our 100 year history. We must overcome this crisis ourselves, too.“We do not know when countries will reopen their borders or when the lockdowns will lift, and so we have to reimagine and reshape our airline and create a new future for our people, our customers and the destinations we serve.“We have informed the government and the trade unions of our proposals to consult over a number of changes, including possible reductions in headcount.”British Airways has furloughed nearly 23,000 staff under the government’s Job Retention Scheme.IAG, which includes\u0026nbspAer\u0026nbspLingus, Iberia of Spain and the low-cost carrier,\u0026nbspVueling,\u0026nbspsaid: “Recovery to the level of passenger demand in 2019 is expected to take several years, necessitating group-wide restructuring measures.”Mr Cruz said: “There  is no government bailout standing by for BA and we cannot expect the taxpayer to offset salaries indefinitely.“Any money we borrow now will only be short\u0026nbspterm and will not address the longer\u0026nbspterm challenges we will face.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

one-quarter.Gatwick airport is likely to be much harder hit than BA’s main base, Heathrow.Profitability at the Sussex airport has always been poorer than at Heathrow. In addition, the airline will be keen to retain its slot portfolio at Heathrow, where it currently operates just over half the total take\u0026nbspoffs and landings.BA’s fleet will also shrink significantly. The carrier has already flown some of its ageing Boeing 747s to be scrapped, and the future of its 12 Airbus A380 “SuperJumbo” aircraft is uncertain.The British Airline Pilots’ Association (Balpa) called BA’s announcement “a bolt out of the blue”.The pilots’ union’s general secretary, Brian Strutton said: “BA pilots and all staff are devastated by the announcement of up to 12,000 possible job losses in British Airways.“This has come as a bolt out of the blue from an airline that said it was wealthy enough to weather the Covid storm and declined any government support.“Balpa does not accept that a case has been made for these job losses and we will be fighting to save every single one.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Indeed, they have become four times as frequent\u0026nbspin the past half-century.Since the 1970s, it is\u0026nbspestimated at least three dozen infectious diseases have emerged from human interference with animals, including Sars, Mers, Ebola, bird flu, swine flu and the Zika virus. As far back as 2007 the World Health Organisation warned that infectious diseases were emerging at a rate that had not been seen before.The spread of the viruses is put down to a deadly combination of wildlife trafficking and consumption, increasing human encroachment into wildlife habitats as more people live in densely populated areas – and air travel, which enables pathogens to take hold globally.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThree years ago, an article\u0026nbsppublished by the US National Centre for Biotechnology Information stated, presciently: “The Aids and influenza pandemics have claimed and will continue to claim millions of lives. The recent Sars and Ebola epidemics have threatened populations across borders. The emergence of Mers may well be warning signals of a nascent pandemic threat.”Zoonotic diseases are complex, and it’s sometimes impossible to say a virus has disappeared, because it might have many different strains, and might mutate and lie dormant. This is a timeline of the main zoonotic diseases to have hit us since the start of the 20th century:Wildlife trade continues in Asia amid calls for restrictions China tries to shut down wildlife trade but markets remain openBlack-market trade ‘may undermine Vietnam ban on disease-rife markets’Stray dogs eating bat meat ‘could have sparked coronavirus pandemic’The 1918 flu pandemic: This was the most severe pandemic in modern times, killing at least 50 million people in two years. It is widely believed that the virus originated in birds because it shared genetic mutations with the bird flu virus later found in Asia, and could have transferred to horses in the trenches of the first world war before spreading to humans. This is disputed, with one study suggesting it came from mammals.Asian flu, 1957:\u0026nbspIn February 1957, a new influenza virus, known as H2N2 emerged in east Asia, which spread into a pandemic. It originated from an avian influenza virus, causing an estimated 1.1 million deaths worldwide.HIV: First identified in 1981, the disease is thought to have been acquired by people in central Africa hunting chimpanzees and coming into contact with their infected blood. However, studies show that HIV may have jumped from apes to humans as far back as the late 1800s, and it has existed in the West since at least the mid to late 1970s. HIV has killed about 35 million people to date, according to the World Health Organisation.Sars:\u0026nbspSevere acute respiratory syndrome is another type of coronavirus, which killed at least 770 people globally in an epidemic in 2002-3. Most victims were in southern China, Vietnam and Singapore. Scientists are not certain of its origins but like Covid-19 it’s thought it could have come from bats and spread to other animals such as civet cats, which are commonly sold in squalid conditions in street markets. The epidemic resulted in more than 8,000 cases, in 26 countries. Of those, 774 died.Swine flu: In 2009-2010 a new strain of flu emerged in pigs in Mexico. The H1N1 virus killed nearly tens of thousands of people in a global pandemic that spread to 214 countries in less than a year. However, overall the outbreak was not as serious as originally predicted, largely because many older people were already immune to it. And the NHS says it now circulates each year and is considered a normal seasonal flu strain, which is covered by the annual seasonal flu vaccine. A study in 2013 suggested between 123,000 and 200,000 people globally may have died as a result of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.Mers:\u0026nbspFirst identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome is also a coronavirus whose symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. With an estimated death rate of 35 per cent, the disease has killed 858 people, according to the WHO. Again, scientists think it spread to humans from bats, this time via camels.Ebola: A 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976, killing 11,300 people. Scientists say it began with a child in Guinea who came into contact with infected bats, but it has since been widely linked to the killing and butchering of bush meat, including monkeys, chimps, antelopes, fruit bats, porcupines and rats.Zika: First identified in Uganda in 1947 in monkeys, the mosquito-borne virus caused alarm in 2015, when it was thought to be the cause of thousands of cases of microcephaly – a shorter-than-normal head – in babies in Brazil. Outbreaks soon appeared throughout the Americas, Africa and other regions. It was thought to have killed 29 babies.Bird flu: Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, has many different strains but one of those, H7N9, has caused 1,568 cases in humans and 616 deaths worldwide since 2013, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.Another strain of the virus, H5N1, first identified in 1997, spread across east and southeast Asia, killing six people in Hong Kong and leading to vast swathes of chickens and turkeys – from Hong Kong to Britain – having to be culled early after contracting the disease. To date 861 cases of human H5N1 infection and 455 deaths have been reported.\u0026nbspThe highest number of infections and deaths were in Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand. The H5N1 virus, which has a 60 per cent mortality rate among infected humans, according to WHO, has not gone away, but is thought to have mutated.Bird flu has been linked to rapid intensification of the poultry industry, with thousands of birds crowded together indoors and with compromised immune systems.The Independent is campaigning against the wildlife trade at the core of the Covid-19 pandemic.\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Once again, the courts have missed a vital opportunity to send a positive message that recognises all parents, including LGBT+ parents, for who they are.“Today’s news is going to be a disappointing blow for trans communities.

It is a charity that has adapted with incredible speed to the crisis to help the most vulnerable in our community. In just five weeks, they have responded to the increased demand for food by quadrupling their output. We hope that our donation, coupled with the campaigning power of The Independent, will help the project grow and reach as many as possible of the one in five Londoners at risk of food poverty.”Another substantial contribution came in yesterday from the Julia and Hans Rausing Trust, which has assigned £16.5m\u0026nbspto charities at the forefront of the coronavirus pandemic and has donated £50,000 to our appeal.How to support our campaignJulia and Hans Rausing,\u0026nbspheirs of food packing giant Tetra Pak, said: “We have been impressed not only by the speed of The Felix Project’s response to the crisis, but the way in which they have managed to get a number of organisations working together to help people across the capital. Efforts like this support communities across London at this time of need, and we are glad to support their inspiring work.”We launched our appeal, in association with the Evening Standard, on Friday 27 March\u0026nbspand have reached £3m\u0026nbspthanks to the generous backing of dozens of London foundations, philanthropists and corporations, including Garfield Weston Foundation, Lansdowne Partners, the Westminster Foundation, Sir Peter Blake, Burberry, Eranda Rothschild Foundation, Citibank and investment holding company Temasek.More than 1,170 members of the public have contributed, donating £103,837 on our Virgin Money Giving page.But there is a sense that we are still in the foothills of the economic crisis, with experts warning the government that food poverty is about to get far worse. The Food Foundation has reported that eight million people in Britain face food insecurity and that three million have been missing meals since lockdown. The Institute for Social and Economic Research at University of Essex estimates that 6.5 million jobs could be lost in the coming months, causing a huge rise in demand for free food.As the biggest supplier of free food in London, The Felix Project has been operating 12 hours a day, six days a week, distributing surplus food to giant community hubs, including Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in Haringey, as well as to 80 charities and schools across the capital.The Independent\u0026nbspis encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

A nurse said meals cooked with fresh Felix produce made her feel “that little bit stronger”.All told of their relief\u0026nbspat being able to access healthy food, thanks to The Felix Project, one of the biggest food redistributors in the country, which has quadrupled daily deliveries to 40 tons since the outbreak of the virus.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesYesterday, in a sign of further upward spiralling demand, The Felix Project broke its own record, ferrying an extraordinary 44 tons to 73 schools and charities, with the heftiest deliveries going to 11 community super-hubs set up by councils as part of a pan-London effort to tackle food poverty in the wake of Covid-19.Felix, on its own, is now supplying more than 100,000 meals a day, up from 20,000 at the start of the outbreak. This is what some of the beneficiaries, volunteers and charities had to say.How to support our campaignFamily at high riskKaren Barnes suffers from type 1 diabetes, an underactive thyroid and chronic back pain, and is a carer for her son, Aidan, six, who has health issues that affect his immune system“We receive two boxes of Felix-supplied food a week, from Enfield Children and Young Persons Services, as my son and I are both categorised as high risk. We felt a bit hopeless about being in isolation. I don’t have much family and you don’t want to be a burden on other people. So these boxes are a lifeline. It’s exciting when they come as we’re on our own. The person who delivers them leaves them on my doorstep and we chat. It’s a nice interaction.Kim Pallas is a nurse working 12-hour shifts at Barnet Hospital. She picks up dozens of cooked meals to give to her colleagues, made each day by BreadnButter, a charity supplied by The Felix Project.“All the patients in our hospital ward are coronavirus patients so it’s been difficult – very emotional and overwhelming at times. You’re just so grateful when fresh, healthy food is put in front of you and you don’t have to think about doing all the cooking.“The support of the food charities is making a massive difference to people like us. To know people care enough about you to do this makes you feel that little bit stronger to cope with all that’s going on during the crisis. It makes you feel valued.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She struggles to make ends meet and has claimed universal credit since her husband died suddenly from lung cancer five months ago.“I collect food parcels from my children’s school in Enfield once a week. We are in a very hard situation. When my husband died, my life was turned upside down. I was alone but had to look after my 11-year-old son David and six-year-old daughter Ola. I work so I’m lucky, but life is expensive. Felix is a huge help and – now that we are in isolation – so important. We leave the house once a week to collect our parcel so it’s the best part of our week.”Justine, 38, is a mother-of-four who escaped an abusive relationship and lives in temporary housing, claiming universal credit.“I first heard about The Felix Project through my six-year-old son’s school and have been picking up weekly packages since the end of last year.“At the moment, we are in isolation and things are tough, but Felix is a lifeline. I have used food banks in the past but they do not provide fresh food. There are luxury items in my Felix boxes that I could never afford, like Innocent Smoothies and mozzarella cheese. Picking up our box from the school is a weekly highlight. I don’t know what we would do without it.”James Quayle is manager of North Paddington Food Bank: “Before coronavirus we were feeding 100 households per week but now we are supporting more than 600 families. We used to be open one day a week with The Felix Project delivering a single truckload of fresh produce, but since Covid we are open six days a week.We have increased our volunteers from a couple of dozen to almost 300 and I am working 14-hour days. The only other comparable thing was the start of the Syrian refugee crisis when I was on Lesbos and witnessed people coming off boats. Similarly, this feels like a tidal wave.”James Smart, 36, is a volunteer at Made up Kitchen. The Hackney-based project had been bringing various groups together for regular “community feasts”. It stepped up to the crisis by delivering around 500 nutritious meals each week to people in the area who are struggling financially, thanks to 12 crates of surplus food given by The Felix Project each week.Mr Smart – a chef and market trader who had been working at a cheese stall before it had to close – is now giving two days a week as one of half a dozen volunteers cooking and coordinating deliveries with Made up Kitchen.“Like a lot of people my own situation feels uncertain,” he said. “This crisis has hit almost everyone in one way or another, which is quite scary. But it’s great that so many people have been getting out and doing something that matters for their community. We’re doing as much as we can right now, but there’s a lot of people who will need help.”He added: “The Felix Project has been such a massive help. It’s so important they can operate on such a big scale across London because it makes so much of the work of smaller groups possible.”The Independent\u0026nbspis encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

Building on successful pilots, we will be rolling out testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in care homes in England and to patients and staff in the NHS.This will mean anyone who is working and living in a care home will be able to have access to a test, whether they have symptoms or not.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

research scientists to those in manufacturing, the expansion of access to\u0026nbsptesting will protect the most vulnerable and help keep people safe.It\u0027s possible because we\u0027ve expanded capacity for\u0026nbsptesting thus far.Mr Hancock insisted care homes had been a top priority for the government as he announced plans to publish daily data on deaths in care facilities and the\u0026nbspcommunity, rather than just hospitals.Professor John Newton, co-ordinator of the national testing effort, said studies had shown that the\u0026nbsppresence of symptoms was not really a good marker in the care home setting for coronavirus among residents and staff.There were significant numbers who were asymptomatic who had the virus and so we have massively increased the amount of testing available, he said.Created with Sketch.Silence for key workers who lost lives to coronavirus Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Staff react outside Salford

WhatsApp said that it had seen people all over the world are turning to voice and video calling on\u0026nbspWhatsApp\u0026nbspmore than ever before.Facebook had announced the new update last week as part of a range of new features coming to its chat apps. As well as the expanded WhatsApp group calling, it said also that it would launch new, huge Messenger meetings and new ways of going live on Instagram.It also noted that WhatsApp is available on Portal, Facebook\u0027s device for the home, which includes a camera and a microphone to allow people to talk to friends. While that hardware received criticism and questions over its privacy and security when it was first released, it has seen something of a re-evaluation as lockdowns have come into effect, with many praising its built-in video calling.WhatsApp said that there are 15 billion minutes of WhatsApp video calls each day, which it said is well above a typical day before the pandemic.Any user can get the new expanded calls by downloading the latest version of the app on iPhone or Android. All users on the call are thought to need the update to be able to join a bigger chat.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He has also since been discharged.It is not clear whether there is any link between the men ingesting the disinfectants and comments made by Donald Trump during a press briefing last week.The US president had pondered out loud about whether household products known to kill the coronavirus could work inside the human body.“I see that disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute” he said. “And is there a way we can do something like that?

Is raising taxes the wrong approach or the Governments only option One surprise of this crisis has been how easily Britons have accepted the lockdown . Some people seem to positively enjoy it.To some it brings back the spirit of the Blitz a feeling of solidarity. To others fewer cars and planes are an indication of the more green lestyle we ought to be living.Its good that people have managed to cope with these restrictions. But when polls indicate that many people would be prepared to put up with a y extension of the lockdown I begin to worry.An economic interruption of this kind carries massive costs and can only be borne for a limited period. Any extension will become extremely dficult for the economy to bear.The OBR, the Governments independent forecaster, floated the possibility of a fall in output of the economy of  per cent for the period April to June.That is beyond anything that has previously been imagined. It wasn’t a definite forecast butit happened the effects on jobs and living standards would be more than devastating.Some describe this economic crisis as the worst in modern times. It may be the worst ever. That doesn’t mean we cant recover. We can and we certainly will.But its important to be patient. Commentators talk about the economy bouncing back, a so called V shaped recovery.This seems unlikely The economy may bounce back but only up to a certain point not necessarily the same point as before. Some firms will have gone out of business, others will have run up debts, some have missed orders that aren’t repeated.How long all these problems last depends on the lockdown. The longer the lockdown, the deeper the downturn. So it is vitally urgent that the Government relax the lockdown as soon as the scientists feel that the peak of the epidemic has been flattened and that it is appropriate.This isn’t about choosing the economy or lives. A flattened economy costs lives too. Even when we relax the lockdown many will still be nervous and may not want to go out to spend money.The continuing need for social distancing will pose problems for hospitality and other businesses and hold back a full recovery. Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor has been bold, promising to do “whatever it takes” to steer the economy through these perilous waters.His scheme for furloughing jobs with the Government paying up to £ a month of peoples wages has helped to prevent firms getting rid of people that they could not afford But it is eye wateringly expensive with costs estimated at up to £billion.Clearly it cannot continue indefinitely. Ironically the generosity of the scheme may have anaesthetised the public to the scale of the crisis we are facing.Butthe Government lts some of the restrictions soon and the economy starts to recover , what should the Chancellor do in his Budget in November  Of course we don’t know exactly what the figures will look like and we must wait to see before final judgements.Almost certainly he will be confronting a massively reduced economy, groaning under skyscraping debt, higher unemployment and only a gradual recovery.Horric as the borrowing figures will be it would be a mistake to move quickly to reduce the debt before the recovery is firmly established.He should let borrowing take the strain in the short term. Any measures to rein in the deficit should be for later. In order to boost jobs he might cut National Insurance or make a temporary cut in VAT designed to bring forward spending.Keir Starmer gave a menacing hint of his approach when he said there would have to be “a day of reckoning” and hinted at tax increases on the better off as though they were to blame.That would be precisely the wrong approach. As the economy gets back to maybe  per cent of where it was before the Chancellor needs to do all he can to support business.He has recently given some generous help to new high tech start ups. Well and good, but it will be important to continue to support existing businesses.It should never be forgotten that firms that have failed in this crisis have not failed though any fault of their own. This down turn is not a normal recession caused by market forces, a rise in interest rates or overheating.No this recession and the bankruptcies have been caused by the Government’s measures rightly introduced to contain the virus. So the Government should not feel embarrassed about continuing some of their schemes to support inidual businesses and indeed they have a duty to do so.The Chancellor sets the framework but ultimately growth does not come from Governments, it comes from iniduals and firms. The way to growth and recovery is to give them the freedom and the incentives and the rest will follow.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers. The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM. No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here: www.thesun whocareswinsappeal.Raising taxes in the current climate is not something the Government is likely to want to do.But the scale of the economic crisis now gripping the UK means they may end up feeling they have little option.So far the Chancellor has done what he had to do to protect businesses and workers from enforced shutdowns. The cost will have to come from somewhere.It is estimated the furloughing scheme alone will cost at least £billion. At the same time, tax receipts have noseed as earnings have decreased and fewer people are spending in the shops.As a result, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that public- sector borrowing will increase by an eye-watering £billion above the earlier forecast.The black hole in the country’s finances left by Covid- means that at some point, the Chancellor is going to have to face the uncomfortable issue of whether taxes will go up.Any rises must be set against the need to ensure nothing chokes the ­economic recovery, which will be vital.We must also guard against hitting the most hard-up in society. And ­crucially, we need to ensure we don’t make it unprofitable for dynamic small companies to operate.One option for the Chancellor is to target the big multi-nationals and billionaires who use tax havens to avoid paying their fair share.Yet we will also need to have big business on our side as we try to recover, so it is a delicate balancing act.Our priority right now still has to be protecting the vulnerable and health workers from another Covid- outbreak.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.But it is time too for the Government to think seriously about how to restart the economy as quickly as possible.Two days ago came news that Jaguar and Aston Martin will restart production in May. The Chancellor needs to help other companies follow suit.The more successful he is, the likelier he will be able to limit the number of extra taxes he has to raise in the months ahead.We are backing a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.” SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He needs to show he is back in charge.The PM has plans, yet to be announced, for “non-essential” stores to open. Next will be schools. This will be the “new normal”.

It has taken pressure off the NHS. The “sombrero” curve has been flattened.Crucially, we now have spare hospital capacity and, despite a shortage of protective equipment, our NHS frontline has avoided meltdown.Yet we continue to hear the dismal dirge, “Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives”, to the muffled drums of the BBC and its throat-slitting Thought For The Day.While some are breaking those rules, many more — especially the over-s — are too terried to poke their nose outdoors evenit’s safe.So non-Covid hospital wards are empty and countless worried patients are missing le-saving treatment for cancer, kidney or heart disease.Others in lockdown are prone to mental health problems, suicide and fast-rising domestic brutality.

Some will leave lockdown to find their jobs gone, perhaps for ever.The Treasury’s mammoth multi-billion support scheme will leave crippling long-term economic wounds.One in four firms has stopped trading and Britain risks its worst economic slump in centuries.We are not alone.

Dirt-poor families in Africa and Asia — reliant on cash sent home by migrant children — are seeing those lelines severed overnight.In America, where Depression-style unemployment is close to million, the revolt against lockdown is already under way.Lockdown is prolonging the worldwide agony. This email from Cambridge post office manager and Sun reader Rob Swt sums up the view of many baffled Sun readers. Rob says: “We allow customers in to match the number serving and everyone has PPE.“At no point has anybody had symptoms or gone absent through coronavirus. We use our common sense then go home to our families before doing it all again the next day.“Along with supermarkets, building sites and some small shops, we have been open throughout and at no point have cases risen to the extent we have had to close down.”If lockdown continues for too long, many of those one- in-four firms which have already stopped trading will not reopen.

Yet on the other side of the world, South Korea has witnessed nothing like the same devastation.To date, there have been just  deaths in the Asian nation, and only , cases - barely a tenth of the British total.While Britain remains in the grip of the storm, South Korea is already emerging from the darkness.What makes this phenomenal gap all the more remarkable is the country’s closeness to China, the initial global centre of the pandemic - which should have left South Korea - a country of  million people - far more vulnerable than Britain to the ravages of the disease.But the South Korean authorities took this seriously, through their prompt action and ruthless efficiency, they quickly managed to get the virus under control.On  February, there had been  new cases, but this daily figure fell dramatically in the subsequent two months, dropping to single digits last week.Amid all the gloom across the earth, South Korea’s astonishing success is a beacon the world.And its achievement is particularly impressive because the nation has not resorted to Chinese or European-style lockdowns.Most of the population has not been placed under effective house arrest, nor has the economy been put into a medically-induced coma.Under strict rules about social distancing, bars, cafes, shops and hotels have remained open.One British journalist based in Seoul, South Korea’s capital, told me that he even had to queue last week for a table at a restaurant in a fashionable district, something that would be unthinkable in Britain.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here: www.thesun whocareswinsappeal.Only a fortnight ago, elections were held for the country’s National Assembly, won overwhelmingly by the ruling Democratic Party.This week, restrictions on churches and gyms will be relaxed.From early May the South Korean football and baseball leagues will resume, though at first in empty venues.So how has South Korea avoided the kind of crisis that has gripped so many western countries, including our own What is the secret of its success  The answer can be found in a national strategy that combines social responsibility with organisational efficiency, governmental foresight, and sophisticated technology.At heart, South Korea has been better prepared than most.That is largely because the nation was badly shaken by the outbreaks of the respiratory syndromes SARS and MERS earlier in the century.Criticism of the Government’s mismanagement was especially strong after MERS in , which left  people dead.In the wake of this condemnation, testing capacity for a pandemic was drastically expanded, supplies of personal protective equipmentwere strengthened, hospitals were equipped with infection control units, and plans for nationwide information campaigns were put in place.So when the first Covid- deaths occurred in China in January, the South Korea state was ready to swing into action, guided by the principles of “test, trace and contain.”Immediately, a Coronavirus taskforce ordered the swt development of a practical diagnostic test that could identy people who had been infected.The job was completed with amazing efficiency.Within just a week, a reliable testing kit had been approved and put into production.There followed a huge programme of testing, often at the rate of , a day, carried out through a vast network  centres and  drive-through facilities.By March , while Britain was still struggling, South Korea had tested over , people.From the start, screening was also applied to all arrivals at Korean airports, including national citizens, something our own Government has never attempted until now.This testing regime was backed up by a huge effort both to trace all the contacts of those who test positive for Covid  and to alert the public to the presence of disease carriers.In this drive, South Korea has the advantage that its population has embraced online and mobile technology so eagerly.This is, after all, the land of mobile telecoms giant Samsung and computer colossus LG.Thanks to such sophistication, the movements of the infected can therefore be uncovered through phone records, GPS tracking, financial statements and CCTV images.This data enables the Korean Centre for Disease Control and Prevention to send text messages, in real time, to mobile users, telling them of any cases in their vicinity.The information also means that the contacts of carriers can be advised to take extra precautions or go into self-isolation.It is an ultra-modern approach that reflects South Korea’s culture.“Koreans are super-good at making things convenient for people. We don’t have any patience. South Korea is one of the most wired countries in the world, where everybody uses cell-phones for just about everything and the Government is able to use all our phones not only to track but to send warnings,” said Kee Park, a lecturer in public health at Hard in the USA.Some might argue all this hi-tech testing and tracing represents a worrying descent into the authoritarian world of Big Brother.But the level of intrusion should not be exaggerated.These text alerts do not reveal any inidual’s name and address, only their gender and age category.Moreover, “track and trace” technology is far less draconian that the European lockdowns.Nor is it correct to pretend that South Koreans are more submissive than westerners.In reality, the country has been a stable, pluralist democracy since .The public’s willingness to challenge the Government was graphically highlighted by huge mass protests held from October  to March  against President Park Geun-Hye over allegations of corruption.More than .million people took to the streets, eventually bringing about her impeachment and downfall.Far from being some downtrodden state, South Korea is more advanced than many parts of the west and this has further helped in the fight against the virus.Its health service is so well managed that it was ranked the best in the world in a  global study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development .There was never any danger of it being overwhelmed, as our own Government feared might happen to the NHS.Again, in contrast to the centralised bureaucracy of the NHS, the South Korean model is privately run, with  per cent of the population covered by compulsory national health insurance.The same spirit of efficiency can be seen right across the Korean infrastructure.Trains, buses and urban metro systems are renowned for their punctuality.Incheon airport, the country’s largest, was ranked the best in the world for  consecutive years from .A dynamic economy, with high levels of exports, ensures that the South Korean population is affluent and well-educated, with more than  per cent of young people going to university.But this prosperity is accompanied by widespread social responsibility, reflected in the strong work ethic and a lower crime rate than most industrialised nations.Respect for others is also shown in the universal willingness to wear face masks, not so much as a barrier against infection but as a means of preventing the spread of disease.A refusal to don one is seen as a social offence, just as Koreans use hand sanitisers everywhere and do not object to the heat sensors that exist in many office buildings to read their temperatures.It is not unusual for citizens to have their temperatures checked a dozen times a day.The climate of solidarity has helped South Korea come through the worst.Its experience provides a lesson to the rest of the world.As Jerome Kim, the Director of the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul puts, it, South Korean contained the virus “through decisive, transparent leadership based on data, not emotion.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For every Peter Kay, who you want to see, there are three members of The Mash Report team, who you really don’t. There are also corporate sponsors to satisfy and a surprise appearance from Prince William, in a Blackadder spin-off sketch, with Stephen Fry, asking: “Have you seen anything good on TV ” .On the face of it then, it looked impossible to separate the wheat from all that celebrity chaff.In reality, though, it was surprisingly easy, because lockdown TV has already taught us song and dance can still work, even on Skype,the artists are as good as Dave Grohl and the others, who collaborated on Times Like These, or as talented and attractive as the Strictly professionals.Just as obviously, we’ve learned to rely on the internet for laughs this past month, because television comedy isn’t anywhere near funny enough to see us through a crisis. Thursday night wasn’t ever going to change that opinion, but it did highlight a ide.Eventhey were phoning in the performances, there were a group of comedians some viewers will have been excited to see, like Coogan, Brydon, Dawn French, Little Britain etc, who all had careers before . And there were a group of comedians who’ve been forced on us, since then, who aren’t comedians at all. At best, they’re pub-funny show-offs — at worst they’re political propagandists trying to bend us to their will.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.The contrast could not have been better illustrated by the segment where modern Mash Report types and old-school stand-ups were given about ten seconds to make us laugh and the only one who could nail it was Tim Vine, who appeared with a placard reading “Bad” and a punchline: “That’s not a good sign is it.”An actual punchline! On the BBC! It’s one of the many things that’s been missing from the network, for years, though I was glad long-suffering viewers didn’t punish TBNI for past failures. Thursday was hardly the time for mass recriminations.At some point in the future, though, someone has to try to explain to the BBC that we prefer comedians who make us laugh rather than tell us off, andthere was a reason why The Big Night In seemed less wearying and slightly more uplting than the usual Comic Relief slog then, beyond the extraordinary circumstances, it was a very obvious one.It only lasted three hours.

He’s not the only one on that show, either. There’s strong competition to be the biggest one from Bluto-ish oaf Tony Bellew, the former world cruiserweight boxing champion, who’s got an even shorter fuse than Fashanu.Both have already been called in for fairly urgent “questioning” by the SAS instructors who always hold the whip hand during these interrogations as, at the first hint of vanity, derangement, pretension or self-delusion, Ant Middleton can shout “GUARD!” and Billy bundles them off with a hood over their head.If it was just a hardman staring contest, of course, the show wouldn’t work. But it’s not. Sometimes the Special Forces team are staring at contestants like “YouTuber” Jack Maynard, trying to get their heads around what the hell it is he actually does for a living.“I will come up with some video idea and I direct, film, edit and present the thing myself.”Billy : “So you’re actually a smart f***er.”There are also emerging friendships, hidden tensions, a lot of honest endeavour and a simmering feud between Paralympian Lauren Steadman and Joey Essex, which erupts on next week’s show .SAS: Who Dares Wins will have to proceed, though, without Katie Price, who quit after a feeble two-day effort, and Anthea Turner, who tried getting all philosophical just before she threw in her armband. “I feel I am in what the Japanese call my second spring.”Fetch the hood, Billy.MEANWHILE, over on episode two of I’ll Get This, Jermaine Jenas says to Sara Pascoe: “I’ll be waiting for the comedian in you to come out.”So we’ll check up on him again in November .C’s SAS: Who Dares Wins.

So can you please just do that for me today Mr Hancock ignored Intisars pleas for an apology, telling him: I think that it is very important that we are constantly learning how to do these things better, listening to the voices on the frontline is a very very important part of how we improve. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Prime Minister was at Carrieaposs side as she gave birth in a London hospital earlier today. A spokesman for the couple said: The spokeswoman said: The Prime Minister and Ms Symonds are thrilled to announce the birth of a healthy baby boy at a London hospital earlier this morning. Both mother and baby are doing very well. The PM and Ms Symonds would like to thank the fantastic NHS maternity team.Their happy news comes after a fraught month for the couple as the county battles the  coronavirus  pandemic.New dad Boris was left fighting for his le in intensive care after being struck down by Covid- with worried Carrie unable to be at his side due to strict rules. However, it was reported she sent the PM, who is now back at work, daily text messages and scan pictures of their unborn son to keep his spirits up. It also meant Boris and Carrie did not see each other for a month as she self-isolated while she was heavily pregnant.The couple announced the news they were expecting in February when they also revealed they were engaged in a post on Carrieaposs Instagram account.Despite rumours swirling that Boris and Carrie were a couple since , the pair only went public with their relationship when he was on the campaign trail to become Tory leader last summer. After working in the Conservative press office, Carrie is now a senior advisor to ocean conservation charity Oceana. The -year-old is also a passionate campaigner for a number of causes, particularly environmental charities. She also bravely took a stand against the release of black cab rapist John Worboys earlier this year. Carrie was just  when she became one of the sick sex attackeraposs victims. She was still a student when Worboys picked her up after she had enjoyed a night out in Fullham in . At the time, Carrie had only £ to get home but Worboys had seemed to take pity on her and offered to accept that as payment, telling her he didnapost like to see women on the street. While she was in his taxi, Worboys first offered Carrie a glass of Champagne, claiming heaposd just had a big win at a casino. Thankfully, she had the good sense to pour it on the floor of his cab without having a drink. However, he then offered her some vodka, which Carrie has said she had a few sips of because she felt indebted to Worboys. She remembers nothing  of the rest of the journey and fears she had her drink spiked. When she got home Carrie says she was  vomiting and laughing hysterically before passing out until pm the next day. Carrie, still aged just , was one of the brave women to testy against the rapist in court and helped secure his conviction. She has said: “The worst thing is not having peace of mind. I’m . per cent sure that nothing happened to me, but I will never know.” But this was not the final time Carrie would have to take action to ensure the sex offender stayed behind bars. In  she couragously waived her right to anonimity to campaign tirelessly to prevent Worboysapos release after it was revealed the parole board was considering him for release.

It comes as scientists claim coronavirus is unlikely to be eradicated and mayeach year like seasonal flu.The Chinese expertsapos predictions echo what the UKaposs chief medical officer, professor Chris Whitty chillingly warned last week. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE. Professor Whitty said the country is unlikely toto normal, until a vaccine can be found, as it has for the flu. The Chinese viral and medical researchers told reporters in Beijing that the virus is not likely to disappear like SARS, because it can infect carriers who have no idea they have symptoms and are passing on silently to others. They said Chinese health officials are still confirming dozens of asymptomatic carriers every day. Mr Miliband praised the UK Government for its attempt to start an international discussion on vaccination, but said “the main donor countries to the global aid effort have been pretty myopic about the crisis at the moment”.  The IRC works with survivors of conflict and disaster in  countries. Mr Miliband also warned that while the coronavirus “tsunami” had yet to hit many of the countries where his organisation worked, it could become “rampant” before too long. IRC research based on modelling from Imperial College London and the World Health Organisation estimates that between  million and one billion people will become infected, and between .m and  million people could die.The underlying health vulnerabilities mean that this is going to hit and it’s not going to be stopped until it’s gone really widespread, the former Labour politician continued. We’ve got maybe four weeks to do vital preventative work. Commenting on the Scottish Government’s decision to recommend the wearing of facemasks in enclosed public spaces where social distancing was dficult, Mr Miliband said “it must be a good thing”. “To the extent that it helps at all it must be a good thing. Andyou’ve been to Japan in the last ten years, it’s the norm, he said. So I think it’s going to become the norm. Asked about the UK Government’s response to the pandemic so far, Mr Miliband said he was “worried”. “I’m worried about the testing. I’m obviously relived at the way the NHS has pulled through and people have pulled together. “And Iaposm worried that thereaposs almost a feeling that the debate about the lockdown is an on-off switch and it isnapost.” Mr Miliband added that he felt there was no going back to the way things were. “Thereaposs no going back to the old normal. Thereaposs going to be a new normal, and that trust between the government and people is so important to making this work.” Mr Miliband also told the Coronavirus Newscast that his family had a run-in with their new neighbours.

George Eustice said people should not be penalised for bringing waste to a dump or recycling centre - which the government has told to reopen in the coming weeks. Government guidance says people should only leave the house for four reasons - shopping for basic necessities, one form of exercise a day, a medical need, or travelling for work purposes. Going to a tip or recycling centre does not feature either in the list of exemptions in the law, or a guide on essential travel from the College of Policing. But ministers are worried fly-tipping has soared, with the Countryside Alliance warning it has risen % in some areas. The Environment Secretary told LBC: We think that it would be essential travel to dispose of waste. We’ve had a problem with fly-tipping because local authorities in some cases took the decision to close those recycling centres. Calling for tips to reopen he added: We think they are a necessary service. We claried guidance on that now in case there was any doubt about that. Many household waste recycling centres closed after government guidance on April  said they only had to stay openpossible. The guidance on prioritising which services to keep open said they were of medium importance. It added: If it is possible to keep HWRCs open, make sure that social distancing rules can be maintained. Always provide adequate staffing levels for health and safety and security purposes. But Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said yesterday the guidance would be amended. He told MPs councils should draw up a plan to reopen in the coming weeks. He added: Public Health England has published guidance for those working in the sector, recommending that where the  metre distance rule cannot be adhered to, staff should make sure that the windows of their vehicles are open for ventilation, and they should wash their hands for  seconds or longer before getting in and out of the vehicle, or use hand sanitiser where handwashing is not possible. We will ensure that councils follow up and adhere to that advice so that those key workers are properly protected as they go about their work.

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said trying to put all pupils back in classrooms on the same day will not be practical. He did not say who wouldto school first. But he pointed to countries that have separated pupils by age groups, as well as a region-by-region approach. London is thought to have been a couple of weeks ahead in the peak of the virus. The Cabinet minister did not put a date on when schools will reopen - saying only it should be at the earliest opportunity once it is safe. But he told the Commons Education Committee: When we bring schools back, they’ll be ed in a phased manner. We recognise the idea of schools ing on day one with a full complement of pupils is not really practical. Mr Williamson is waiting for advice from a subcommittee of the governmentaposs scientic experts SAGE, which was set up around three weeks ago. The review is looking at the particular issues of how to open schools once the governmentaposs five tests on curbing the virus are met.Head teachersapos leaders have warned the earliest realistic date schools can reopen is June  - and even then, planning would need to begin very soon. Mr Williamson told MPs we want to make sure schools are given proper notice before they are asked to reopen. There would also be specic advice for places like special schools which could dfer to the rest of the system, he said. He added students should have the opportunity to sit exams - but that he and exam boards have been working on holding them in the autumn. Mr Williamson confirmed he is looking to see “what works” in other countries including Denmark and Germany - both of which are phasing aby age. Denmark has sent children under  back to school first, while Germany has focused on older students who are taking exams, with the approach ying from one region to the next.  Mr Williamson admitted he is “concerned” about the number of children classed as vulnerable - often those in care or with care plans - missing school in the pandemic. Those children can continue attending schools but just % were doing so. The number since rose to %. Mr Williamson said there would need to be a “very targeted approach” at the most disadvantaged communities. The Cabinet minister said he is working very closely with the Home Office amid fears children are being targeted by predators online during the crisis.

Michael Gove revealed that a domestic effort has been launched to slow the spread of coronavirus by producing masks that limit the droplets that each of us might be responsible for.His commitment comes after Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon gazumped the UK government in advising Scots to wear masks. She told her daily briefing that coverings should be worn in enclosed spaces, such as shops or on public transport. It is thought that her advice is likely to become UK-wide guidance in the coming days, although the government in Westminster has so far stopped short of it, referring to the science behind their effectiveness as weak. Thereports that the government wants to delay an announcement on face coverings until it has stockpiled enough.The government yesterday said it is carefully reviewing the advise of its SAGE scientic committee and will make public any changes in policy.In a Commons exchange with his Labour shadow Rachel Reeves, Mr Gove said: “I can confirm Lord Agnew, the joint Cabinet Office and Treasury minister, has launched a domestic effort to ensure we produce just such masks and that is part of the broader effort that Lord Deighton is leading on ensuring we can bolster the production of personal protection equipment.” Ms Sturgeon said that while the evidence was limited, wearing face coverings could help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus by those people who are not yet showing symptoms. We are recommending that you do wear a cloth face coveringyou are in an enclosed space with others where social distancing is dficult, for example public transport or in a shop, she told her daily briefing. Let me emphasize the key point here which is that you should not really be in situations very often like that right now,you are complying with the stay-at-home rules. But Downing St insisted that a change to the rules in the UK was not imminent. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: SAGEaposs review has been sent to ministers who are reviewing it carefully. Once a decision has been reached we will announce it publically. Ministers are considering the advice and once we reach a decision we will say so.

Wider testing will be essential before the government can ease up on the UK lockdown - because itaposll show whether the virus is running rampant again. Mr Hancock has claimed he is on track to hit the target of , tests a day by April , despite needing to double them within days. Because capacity has now increased so substantially, we are now able to expand who can get the tests, he said.Our ultimate goal is that everyone who could benefit from a test gets a test. Mr Hancock said: Itaposs all part of getting Britain back on her feet. But you may have to drive for a -minute round trip to get a test and there could be heavy demand on new kits to be posted to your home. Hereaposs who is eligible and how the system will work.

But other people who have tested positive for covid- include losing taste and a sense of smell.    It will showyou currently have Covid-. This is useful to proveyour symptoms are actually the virus. It does not showyouaposve had Covid- in the past. It will help people work out when they and their household members canto work safely. Where do I log on to book a test  Visit the governmentaposs web page. Slots for testing tend to appear at am and can be snapped up quickly. Where do I go to get tested     The first port of call is a drive-through testing centre - with  promised by the end of April. The government expects you to be able to drive for up to  minutes from your home to get to a drive-through site, leaving some with potentially a -minute round trip. WhatI canapost drive   For those who donapost live near enough to a testing site or canapost drive there are other options. The government has pledged that Royal Mail and Amazon will deliver home testing kits. The availability of these was limited at first, with , selling out within two minutes on the first day. It was later upped to , a day and officials hoped for it to scale up to , a day by the end of April. What about other ways of getting tested  Meanwhile apossatelliteapos test kits are also being sent directly to care homes to enable residents with symptoms to be tested. And the Army is helping set up mobile testing units which will travel the country to places like care homes, police stations and prisons. Itaposs not clear how these will help workers without a mobile unit or satellite kit at their place of work. However, as of April  they were in Torquay, Hereford, Boston, Salisbury, Bishop Auckland, Barnet, Northampton, Grimsby, Skegness, Blackpool, Macclesfield, Ramsgate, Harwich, Barnsley, Grantham and Kendal. How long will I wait for results     Test results from the drive-through sites will be sent out by text within  hours, the government says. For home delivery tests, the waiting time is  hours after the sample has been sent off. Itaposs not clear how quickly a test will be booked in once youaposve asked for it - presumably it depends on demand. Why are essential workers getting tested  The aim is simple - to ensure they can get back to work. Because the test showsyou currently have Covid-, it also can given an indication that your cough is just a  alarm. So people whoaposve been self-isolating to protect others due to a mild cough can get back on the front line. Whataposs it like getting the test   The test involves taking a swab  of the nose and throat - and it goes back pretty far, so be prepared. A single swab is used to collect a liquid sample from the back of your throat and your nose. This swab is then placed into a sample tube and securely packaged, where it is sent to the lab for testing. Depending on where you get tested, you will either have a clinician take your swab or be asked to do it yourself.

It’s understood the Prime Minister was with his -year-old partner throughout the birth at a London hospital, with the boy being delivered on Wednesday morning. Their baby was born two months to the day after her pregnancy - and their engagement - was announced on Instagram. The news makes Mr Johnson just the fourth Prime Minister in  years to have a baby while in office, and is believed to be at least Mr Johnsonaposs sixth child.  Her due date has never been publicly revealed, and today’s announcement comes nine months after the couple moved into Downing Street and three months after Mr Johnson was fighting for his le in intensive care with coronavirus.Early le and education Carrie Symonds is the daughter of Matthew Symonds, founder of The Independent, and one of the paper’s lawyers, Josephine McAffee. Her education saw her attend the £,-a-year Godolphin and Latymer School in Hammersmith, west London. She went on to read theatre studies and history of art at the University of Warwick, graduating with a first class degree in . Her upbringing is a far cry from that of her great-grandmother, Emily Beaven.  Emily Beaven was a Labour activist and trade union champion who worked as a magistrate and councillor. Beaven fought for women’s rights in some of Manchester’s most deprived areas more than  years ago.John WorboysIn , aged just , Ms Symonds’ became one of Black Cab rapist John Worboys’ victims when he picked her up as she waited for a London night bus.Later she bravely went public about the ordeal, recalling how Worboys told her he didn’t like seeing young women waiting on their own, and offered to drive her home.  He lied to her and said he lived in the same area, as well as claiming he had won money at the casino, offering her a celebratory glass of champagne. She accepted, but secretly poured it on the floor, fearing it was spiked. Twisted Worboys told her about a woman who had performed a sex act for £ and asked Carrieshe would do the same. But she laughed it off before he took his attack to another level, climbing into the back of the taxi and attempting to ply her with drink. Despite her refusals, he persisted, and she finally had a shot of vodka - thought to be spiked as she has no recollection of what happened after. She said: “I downed it, which was stupid, as I just wanted to get home. From that point on I can’t really remember what happened. Worboys was convicted of attacks on  women, involving rape, assaults and drugging, in  but police believe he could have had as many as  victims.  Ms Symonds waived her right to anonymity, saying in an interview: “It was absolutely terrying when I found out how many women he had gone after.I was definitely in a position of danger, in a situation where I was not in control and I will never know what really happened to me. He is a sad, wicked man who is a danger to society. I feel so angry that he pleaded not guilty and made us go through the pain of giving evidence.” Political career  Ms Symonds has worked in politics for a decade, first working with Mr Johnson on his successful  campaign to be re-elected as Mayor of London.She has also worked as a spinner for a host of top Tories, including Sajid Javid and John Whittingdale during their time in the cabinet.She also advised Zac Goldsmith before taking on the role of Conservative communications chief, a role she held until .  It was later reported that Ms Symonds was asked to step down from her role with the Tories or risk being fired, after she was allegedly accused of claiming thousands of pounds of unauthorised expenses and not doing her job well. Mr Johnson reportedly personally stepped in to try to save her job, while a spokesperson declined to comment on the expenses allegations. Ms Symonds’ friends dismissed claims of poor performance as smears. Since then she has worked for conservation charity Oceana, and uses her social media s to showcase her passion about conservation and animal rights. Relationship with Boris Johnson  After knowing each other for many years, Ms Symonds and Mr Johnson confirmed their relationship in early . The news came just a few months after Mr Johnson’s separation from we Marina Wheeler was confirmed. However in  Mr Johnson - who was Foreign Secretary at the time - was spotted at Ms Symonds’ th birthday party, while he was still married to Marina. Their affair was exposed in the September of that year, just  hours after Mr Johnson confirmed he and Marina were separating. In June  she watched Mr Johnson launch his bid for the Tory leadership - and role of Prime Minister.During the Conservative leadership campaign police were called to a domestic disturbance at her flat after neighbours head smashing and shouting. Shortly afterwards a staged photo of the couple speaking in the countryside was leaked in a bid to play down the incident."},{"url":null,"title":"5 physical symptoms anxiety can","story":"NewsThese  physical symptoms of anxiety can easily be mistaken for coronavirusWith the coronavirus UK death toll now exceeding ,, its understood anxiety is also on the rise but doctors are trying to help people copeShareCommentsByBradley JollyDigital journalist:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video coronavirus-facemask-help-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news -physical-symptoms-anxiety-can-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

With the death toll of those with Covid- on the sharp rise again in the UK today, doctors say it is unsurprisingwe feel particularly anxious at the moment.But some symptoms of anxiety are physical ones, unlike psychological symptoms which largely affect our mind. Tightness in the chest and shortness of breath are telltale signs of anxiety - but can also be symptoms of coronavirus. Dr Sarah Jarvis, clinical director of Patientaccess, said: Some of the symptoms of anxiety and panic attacks – feeling short of breath, palpitations, dizziness etc – are sometimes also seen in coronavirus. The doctor, though, suggested ways to tell that itaposs definitely anxiety and not coronavirus. . Shortness of breath Dr Jarvis said people take a few minutes to check in with themselves and try to steady their breathing. The symptoms of panic attacks tend to settleyou concentrate on your breathing and take very slow breaths, she added. Try tummy breathing - put one hand on your chest and the other on your tummy. You should aim to breathe quietly by moving your tummy with your chest moving very little. If you were able to calm yourself down and find a steady breathing pattern within those few minutes, you may not be dealing with coronavirus. But the World Health Organisationsaysyou have coronavirus your chest may begin to feel tight or you begin to feel as though you cannot breathe deeply enough to get a good breath. Shortness of breath associated with the Covid- infection is progressive in nature and can become le-threatening over a period of hours to days without medical care. - - - - - - - - ,- - ,+ - ,  . Problems with digestion Stomach pains, constipation and diarrhoea are signs of anxiety, doctors say. This is largely because the communication system between your brain and the enteric nervous system, which governs your digestion, is affected by stress. Of course, eating foods that don’t agree with you or not exercising can affect your digestion too. However, researchers recently studied data from  patients with Covid- in China’s Hubei province and discovered that . per cent of these patients arrived at the hospital with digestive symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting or abdominal pain. These symptoms, though, were usually accompanied by more typical signs such as a dry cough and high temperature. Therefore,you are only experiencing digestive issues it is unlikely to be coronavirus.  . Increased heart rate An increased heart rate is a classic sign of anxiety, according to the National Institute of Mental Health . Adrenal glands churn out hormones when you are faced when something stressful. So, receptors in your heart react by speeding up your heartbeat as a result. This lets you to pump more blood to your big muscles so you could theoretically flee or combat a threat. However, a racing heart rate can also signal coronavirus, doctors suggest. Dr As Munaf, an NHS consultant, said an elevated heart and breathing rates could indicate “you’ve potentially got signs of an infection, which in this climate could be Covid-”. If itaposs an anxiety attack, your heart rate should settleyou concentrate on your breathing and take very slow breaths. However,itaposs coronavirus your heart rate is likely to remain fast - especially during any form of exercise or movement.  . Muscle pain Your muscles tense up as part of your stress responseyou are suffering from anxiety. Many people with anxiety report feeling tight in their neck, back, or shoulders. But, likewise, some coronavirus patients report muscle soreness across their body. According to WHO, about  per cent of all Covid- patients experienced body aches or joint pain. These aches are triggered by chemicals called cytokines - which the body releases while responding to the infection. Muscle pains in coronavirus patients, though, are usually accompanied by other more well-known symptoms. If you are worried about your symptoms, you can ring  for the NHSapos dedicated service. To protect others, do not go to places like a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.

Mum Chloe Knight, , said her son Freddie Merrylees suffered a rash, high fever, bloodshot eyes and a cracked mouth just days before the UK went into its Covid- lockdown. He was drowsy and lost his appetite, and scans done in a hospital revealed that valves leading to his heart were swollen. Miss Knight said doctors initially thought Freddie had a case of scarlet fever, but after taking him to Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital three times he was diagnosed with potentially fatal Kawasaki disease. The mum said she later came down with symptoms that were consistent with the new strain of coronavirus, but she and her son were not tested for it. Has your child been diagnosed with Kawasaki disease recently  Email webnews@mirror. Miss Knight told the Edinburgh Evening News that she took Freddie to see a GP on March  after he developed a rash and it was thought that he had scarlet fever. She said his symptoms worsened despite taking medication and she took him to the hospital, but was told his condition would improve. She took him back to the hospital after he had a nose bleed, but his symptoms were again put down to scarlet fever, she said. Miss Knight said: “I started crying because I felt like it was something a lot more. He was just leless, like a zombie, there was nothing there. Anyone who knows Freddie would know he’s the most hyper little boy – something was wrong.” The next day, his face had broken out in a rash, he was in pain and he was having trouble swallowing. Ms Knight said her son was admitted to Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital on March  during the worst week of my le.The discovery of a heart murmur led to scans that revealed the swollen valves leading to his heart, said Miss Knight. Freddie was in the hospital for five days and has been taking medication at home since he was discharged. His mum said: “I can’t praise the doctors and nurses at the Sick Kids Hospital enough, they were brilliant with Freddie and made his experience there that much better.” Miss Knight said she developed Covid- symptoms including a cough, fever and loss of taste and smell.Also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, Kawasaki disease causes the blood vessels to become inflamed and swollen. It mainly affects children under five and causes heart complications in about  per cent of patients. If the condition goes untreated, the complications can be fatal in about two to three per cent of cases, the NHS said. British and Italian doctors are investigating a possible link between Covid- and clusters of severe inflammatory disease among children arriving in hospitals with high fevers and swollen arteries.  Several pathogens, including some human coronaviruses, have been suggested as a possible trigger for the disease, according to a doctoraposs report in the US medical journal Hospital Pediatric. Ms Knight, from Edinburgh, shared her sonaposs story after the UK Paediatric Intensive Care Society tweeted an alert it said was from NHS England. The tweet said in the last three weeks, there has been an apparent rise in the number of children of all ages presenting with a multi-system inflammatory state requiring intensive care across London and also in other regions of the UK. It said the effects had been seen in both children with and without coronavirus but there was evidence that some patients had had coronavirus previously.

Although not confirmed in all cases, the symptoms are similar to Kawasaki disease, of which there has been an increase in cases in countries dealing with bad Covid- outbreaks. On Monday, doctors were issued an alert about a sharp rise of infants being admitted to intensive care with a Kawasaki-like disease in Britain and Italy. The illness is generally more common in parts of Asia. Kawasaki disease primarily affects children under five years of age, with symptoms including a rash swollen glands in the neck dry, cracked lips red fingers or toes and red eyes. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Monday he was aposvery worriedapos about reports of the inflammatory condition, as top doctor Prof Chris Whitty said itaposs plausible it was being triggered by Covid-.Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirrorSimilar cases have been reported in the USA and it has left doctors and medical professionals there baffled. Right now, weaposre at the very beginning of trying to understand what that represents, Columbiaaposs Dr Mark Gorelik told Reuters. Dr Gorelik said he believes the cases are likely not Kawasaki disease, but a similar process that shares an underlying mechanism with Kawasaki, which is thought to be triggered by an infectious agent that sparks an immune response. The three New York cases follow a report at Stanford University in Calornia, in which a -month-old was admitted to the hospital with Kawasaki disease and was later diagnosed with Covid-. TODDLER SUFFERING WITH KAWASAKI AFTER FEVER Gemma Brownaposs two-year-old son is suspected of having the aposinflammatory syndromeapos linked to Covid-, the Mail reports. Doctors were initially baffled by the boyaposs symptoms after the tot developed a fever and rash across his body. But a senior consultant eventually diagnosed the boy with the rare Kawasaki disease, a form of toxic shock syndrome which causes the body’s immune system to attack its own organs. Gemma told Mail Online: I asked for him to be tested, as I had a gut feeling that there was a connection between COVID- and Kawasaki. Both attack your immune system and the whole family had been poorly with Covid symptoms before he fell ill. I was adamant that there was a link and was begging for a test, but they just told me that there was no need to test the under-fives. The brave lad was given an immunoglobin transfusion and was in hospital for five days. TEEN CRITICAL WITH CORONAVIRUS HAD aposMEASLES LIKEapos RASH    Lewis Greig suffered a measles-like rash, red swollen eyes and vomiting before being admitted to hospital and testing positive for coronavirus. The -year-old remains on a ventilator to help him breathe, and is described as critical but stable. His mum Karen Simpson, , said: He started being sick, had a sore head and was really tired. “By Thursday, he had developed a measles-like rash on his hands and his eyes went deep red and bloodshot. One of the doctors said to us children don’t present with a dry cough like adults do. In children, there’s an inflammatory reaction which makes it look like an autoimmune disease. Karen is warning other parents to keep an eye out for similar symtoms.

Kirstine Adkin said she couldnapost taste raw garlic, ground coffee or cinnamon. The -year-old NHS medic then lost all sense of smell and taste as she fell sick  with the killer virus. At first she started with a headache and back ache but put it down to work stress. But her condition deteriorated and she was left struggling to breathe.

I developed severe headaches above both eyes, which got worse and worse. The worst headaches Iaposve ever had. Day Two Kirstine began experiencing back aches. I woke up with a headache, but put it down to stress headaches. Given the current situation at work, I didnapost think a headache was very signicant. About mid day I started getting a really achy back. Again, working as a paramedic involves lting people down the stairs. Itaposs not uncommon for me to get an achy back. However that night the pain in my back was so bad I realised that this probably wasnapost my normal aches.Day Three The aches got worse and spread around her body, as she lost her sense of smell. I woke with full body aches still mostly in my back and my head I called in sick, still unsure whether I was doing the right thing as I didnapost have a cough, no temperature. Was it just a bad back and headaches due to the stress weaposre all under  Later that day everything got worse, I didnapost leave bed, and by the evening I had some pains in my chest and felt a little breathless when moving around. I decided to disinfect my surfaces in my bedroom, and thataposs when I realised I couldnapost smell a thing. I proceeded to smell everything around the house, but absolutely nothing! Day Four A mild cough began and Kirstineaposs sense of taste vanished. The aches and pains started to improve. Only today I developed a slight dry cough. The coughing was constant for an hour or two in the morning but then was so spread out Iaposd maybe only have an episode of coughing once every  hours.

The global coronavirus pandemic is not just affecting people’s physical health. The anxiety, stress and uncertainty of it – and the sweeping changes we’re having to make to our lestyles – are also having an impact on people’s mental health too. If it’s making you feel that way, then you’re not alone. It’s quite normal to feel this way in such a dficult and unpredictable situation. Here are some tips and strategies recommended by our BACP members to help you cope with the mental health impacts of the current global situation. Keep a routine Many people are working from home for the first time in their lives, and some will now be juggling a full-time job and home-schooling their children. Plus, there are people whose usual activities have been curtailed by self-isolation. Our member Vasia Toxavidi says keeping a routine can be really important. “Without a routine, negative thinking and anxiety can escalate. I would suggest that people create a day to day plan of things they will need to do e.g. create a morning exercise programme, work from homepossible, cook something dferent, get into an online course.” Think about restricting access to news media and social media Many of our members recommend having a think about how and when you access the news or social media. This may involve choosing news sources you trust – and avoiding social media channels filled with speculation. Stick to the official government guidance and NHS advice websites. Or limit your access to the news to a certain time of the day. “Some people can be quite paralysed by this anxiety and may want to completely stop interacting with the news,” says Elizabeth Turp.  Keep connected with friends and family In our new world of self-isolation and social distancing, we can’t meet up with family and friends like we used to. But keeping connected to them is vital. Melani Halacre recommends “connecting online with friends and talking about other stuff, inventing new fun ways to connect. An online pub quiz among friends...learn a dance routine at home then share it  Play games online  Cook the same recipe in your own home whilst online ” Be present Emma Brand recommends ‘being present.’ “Take a breath and really experience where you are and how you are feeling. To take in your surroundings and thank the space environment and people in your space - to actively be grateful is very powerful,” she says. Practise gratitude Hansa Pankhania also recommends being grateful for what you have, instead of what you do not. And Natasha Page recommends keeping a gratitude diary, where you write down three things you are grateful for every day. She adds: These can be small things such as the sun shining, hearing your child laugh, a home-cooked meal, a cosy bed. Think about what are the things you do have and are grateful for. Try some breathing and relaxation techniques Take a five-second breath in through the nose, hold that breath for five seconds and then breathe out for five seconds. Do this five times, says Catherine Gallacher. Melani Halacre recommends the STAR technique. “Smile, take aand relax...breathing out longer than in to override fight and flight mechanism,” she says. Cate Campbell also recommends trying mindfulness or relaxation apps, and practising deep breathing. Write down your anxieties, and let them go It can help to express this anxiety in a way that you can control. That could be writing down what you feel, or keeping a journal. “Acknowledge that you feel this way. Don’t ignore these feelings,” says Elizabeth Turp. “Allow yourself to worry, put it down in writing in a notebook, and then put that away. Let it go.” Get access to natural light Lockdown may have limited your trips to parks and for countryside walks, but itaposs still important to get access to natural light, says Rakhi Chand. Our exposure to natural light is limited at the moment, and this affects our serotonin and melatonin levels - both vital for our mental health. Rakhi recommends sitting near windows and making home environments as light and airy as possible. If youaposre lucky enough to have a a balcony or garden, use it regularly.  She also says that certain foods - such as walnuts, almonds or bananas - can help boost melatonin, and salmon, eggs and spinach are among the foods that can help boost serotonin. She also says itaposs worth looking into Vitamin D supplements, a light therapy lamp and limiting blue light from phones or screens as it disrupts circadian rhythm. Look after your wellbeing Make sure you are looking after yourself, doing what you can to help get a good night’s sleep, eating well and doing exercise, adds Catherine Gallacher. “I always talk to my clients about a wellbeing check. Sleeping, eating, exercising. If we manage our health like this, it can help make us more robust against anxiety.” Running either on the spot, or outside, releases endorphins and fools the brain and body that they’ve run away from the danger, says Cate Campbell. Use all your senses One of the self-care tips recommended by Eve Menezes Cunningham is to use all your senses to notice where you are. You might want to notice five things you can see right now, five things you can hear right now, says Eve, or any smells or tastes. “These can help us resist the well-worn neural pathways around catastrophising and feeling helpless.” There are more of Eve’s self-care tips available to read here. No expectations, no pressure Sarah Wheatley, who specialises in helping new parents, says that she often discusses with her clients, how “when we live in extraordinary times, all bets are off.” “Since expectations can be one of the things that are dficult to manage as a new parent, when there are no expectations it can be really freeing and allow people time to find their way without any pressure. “The pressure to get back into shape, the pressure to socialise, the pressure to feed certain ways, the pressure to feel calm and relaxed, the pressure to look as though you have it ‘all together’. These pressures are reduced by physical isolation, and can be helpful to some mothers.” Positive thinking At times, this may feel very dficult to do depending on your personal situation. But re-framing a negative situation into a positive one can be very helpful. Indira Chima says: “I believe there are a lot of positives to be gained, which might not be apparent right now. It forces people to slow down and breathe and take stock and that is always a good thing.   “We live at such a fast, frenetic pace and sometimes donapost stop to think about what itaposs all about and where we are heading.  This is forcing us to do that.  And we will grow as a result of this.” Ask for support “It’s not a sign of weakness, but strength to reach out and ask for support,” says Hansa Pankhania “Make a list of everyone you know, friends, family, colleagues, neighbours etc. Now tick  people from this list, who can provide practical, psychological and moral support.  Connect with them and sustain this support circle.” If you would like support from a qualied professional, many counsellors offer online or telephone counselling. They can help you explore and understand what youaposre feeling. To find a counsellor or psychotherapist who can help you visit our Therapist Directory. I rang my mum and started crying. I said I donapost even want to go food shopping anymore because I canapost bare standing in these queues for so long. She said theyaposll probably have a policy in place for pregnant woman, so I rang up the Range to ask.The mother said she canapost get family members to do her shopping for her because they are in the high risk category for coronavirus.She continued: I was embarrassed to even phone them up but when I got through I asked the girlthere was a queue and she said yes.  I told her my situation, that Iaposm pregnant and canapost physically queue up for that long but I needed essential items. I askedthey have a policy for pregnant women, so I donapost have to wait in it and her reply really upset me. She said no you will have to queue up just like everyone , we only allow NHS staff to go to the front of the queue. I broke down when I got off the phone. The Range has been approached for comment. Amanda said she also suffers from a condition called SPD, which prevents her from being able to stand for long periods of time and can cause extreme pain.

Neumil, the companyaposs lead mCBM, is already being developed for the universal treatment of respiratory tract infections , including Influenza Virus , Respiratory Syncytial Virus , and now coronaviruses. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.   Lead researcher Gary Taylor, professor of biology at St Andrews, told the Daily Mail : Classic antivirals actually attack some part of the virusaposs machinery, whereas our drug actually inhibits the virus from even getting into cells. We envision it being given as a nasal spray, and imagine it being given weekly or every other day.  It works by masking glycan receptors in patientsapos airways and thereby preventing the entry of the virus and has the potential to revolutionise the treatment of RTIs. This is because it provides clinicians with the opportunity to offer patients total protection against any circulating viral strain.  The successful studies involved both treating infection and blocking new infections with MCBMs, using plaque - visible structures in a sheet of cells - reduction tests. Pneumagen has been working closely with Public Health Englandaposs Porton facility and separately with the University of GlasgowapossMRC Centre for Virus Research. At both Porton and UoG, the mCBMs were found to reduce the number of Sars-CoV- plaques in these tests when the mCBMs were used in both prevention and treatment of infection. Pneumagen now wants to begin clinical testing for the prevention and treatment of Covid-. Its chief executive Douglas Thomson said: Todayaposs positive results from in-vitro studies of our mCBMs against coronaviruses show that glycan binding has the potential to prevent and treat infection. This further supports the value of our universal therapeutic modality to block access to lung cells of Sars-CoV-, as well as other viruses, that cause respiratory tract infections, providing the potential for a pan-viral respiratory product. Our goal is now to rapidly begin clinical testing for the prevention and treatment of Covid-. A glycan is a generic name for a carbohydrate complex, made up from connected carbohydrate, or sugar, molecules.

The event has been organised to honour Captain Moore, who embarked on a fundraising effort walking  laps of his garden before his th birthday. Originally wanting to raise £, for the NHS, Tom has gone on to rasie almost £million - making his the biggest single JustGiving fundraiser ever. Biggin Hill Heritage Hangar had originally organised a flypast involving an iconic Mark IX Spitfire for the Captainaposs birthday, but on Monday it said it had been denied permission to complete the flight. Instead, its aircraft will fly on a circuit around Biggin Hill Airfield, near Croydon, to coincide with the weekly Clap for Carers event at pm. Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog here Alex Monk, a pilot who works for the company that restored the Spitfire, told thethey would later offer Captain Tom a ride in one of the planes, adding: “If it’s safe to do so, we’ll fly him in one of the two-seater Spitfires. That’s still something nice for him to look forward to. I think he’d appreciate that.” The firm are still able to fly in the air traffic zone around the airfield without needing permission. The flight on Thursday will go over the Princess Royal University Hospital, just on the edge of Bromley. Mr Monk added: “That way they can see a Spitfire and we can do a salute to the people of the NHS. We’re going to try and do something as a clap for the NHS and it happens to be on Tom’s birthday, which will be nice. Fingers crossed we’ll gun for that.” A school in Bedfordshire has also been flooded with thousands of cards from well wishers across the globe for Captain Tom.  Ahead of his landmark birthday on Thursday, more than , cards have been sent to Bedford School where his grandson, Benjie Ingram-Moore, attends. Cards were also sent from famous names including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Dame Kelly Holmes and England football captain Harry Kane. Benjie turned to his school for help when he learned that the post office was being swamped with cards. The -year-old said: The volume of cards that have been sent to granddad is just astonishing. So many of the cards are truly heartfelt with thousands from young children who have taken the time to use their artistic talent and write a personal message.  Another £, has been generously been donated via his birthday cards. It means a lot to granddad as well as us as a family. We are hugely proud of how the nation has taken granddad to its heart. Words canapost express how much I idolise him.

Admin assistant Becca Brown is in debt after splurging her £, savings and more on masks, gloves and shields, but believes medical authorities should have been more prepared. The -year-old, who keeps the PPE under lock and key, is even using some of her unused lesaving equipment to create coronavirus-themed artwork.And in an attempt to recover some of the £ credit card debt she accumulated, Becca has admitted selling some PPE on eBay for five times the original price.For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.   This comes as Brits stood in silence yesterday to remember the brave medics and carers who have died fighting the virus.Official figures show  NHS workers and  social care staff have lost their lives to covid-, though it is feared those numbers are far higher.While nurses have been forced to wear bin bags due to the drastically short supply of equipment in hospitals.Becca - who has been abandoned by many of her friends - cares for an elderly aunt near Portsmouth and began ordering PPE online early in the crisis to avoid regular trips to the shops.

Last week the US president said scientists should explore whether inserting light or disinfectant into the bodies of people infected with Covid- might help them treat the respiratory illness caused by the virus. After an outpour of disbelief and warnings over how this could be fatal and is very dangerous, Trump said his comments were sarcastic. The director of the Georgia Poison Centre reported that two men had drunk cleaning products over the weekend. Gaylord Lopez said both men, who had histories of psychiatric problems, are expected to recover. He told the Daily Mail he did not knowthe men drank the chemicals because theyaposd heard Trumpaposs comments. A state health officer in Kansas reported a similar case of an unidentied man drinking a product because of aposadviceapos, although he did not specy the source of the advice. Dr Lee Norman said they are doing everything they can to counter-message against that kind of remedy. Trump previously said as Dr Deborah Birx, the head of White House coronavirus response, looked on aghast: “I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning  “Because you see, it gets on the lungs, and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it’d be interesting to check that. So that you’re going to have to use medical doctors, but it sounds - it sounds interesting to me.” Pointing at his head, he said: “I’m not a doctor but I’m a person who has a good you know what.”  After much criticism Mr Trump said that he was being sarcastic when he raised the possibility of using disinfectant inside peopleaposs bodies to fight  coronavirus. Reckitt Benckiser, the company that makes Dettol and numerous other household cleaning products, released a statement reiterating that its products are harmfulconsumed by humans. It said: [We have] been asked whether internal administration of disinfectants may be appropriate for investigation or use as a treatment for coronavirus. As a global leader in health and hygiene products, we must be clear that under no circumstances should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body . Walter Shaub, former director of the US Office of Government Ethics watchdog, said: “I can’t believe that in  I have to caution anyone listening to the President that injecting disinfectant could kill you.” Doctors also hit out at the President’s comments. Craig Spencer, director of global health in emergency medicine at New York-Presbyterian Columbia University Medical Centre, said: “My concern is that people will die. People will think this is a good idea. This is not willy-nilly, maybe-this-will-work advice. This is dangerous.” "},{"url":null,"title":"cadbury unveil first new logo","story":"NewsCadbury unveil first new logo in  years - but people cant tell the dferenceThe chocolate giants over at Cadbury have got a new logo and they are said to have spent a pretty penny on it, but some people cant tell which is whichShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video you-remember-discontinued-chocolate-bars-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news cadbury-unveil-first-new-logo-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

He even missed one of the countryaposs biggest annual celebrations four days later - an absence which has been described as unprecedented. Over the weekend, claims emerged that that dictator had passed away, or been left in a vegetative state, following a botched heart operation because the surgeonaposs hands were shaking so much. By Sunday, the state-backed media in North Korea had jumped into action and reported that Kim had thanked workers on the project in the city of Wonsan, where a train believed to be his has been spotted in satellite images amid unveried reports that he is either dead, in a vegetative state or alive and well. And now South Koreaaposs minister for North Korean affairs Kim Yeon-chul believes that the Covid- crisis could be to blame.  The Unication Minister, who oversees North Korea engagement, told a parliamentary hearing: It is true that he had never missed the anniversary for Kim Il Sungaposs birthday since he took power, but many anniversary events including celebrations and a banquet had been cancelled because of coronavirus concerns.The minister said it is not unusual for Kim to vanish for weeks at a time - saying there were at least two instances since mid-January where he was out of sight for nearly  days. He said: I donapost think thataposs particularly unusual given the currentsituation. North Korea has insisted it has had no cases of coronavirus but that it is prepared for the pandemic. Butthe rumours are true and Kim Jong-un is dead, this would leave a huge power vacuum in North Korea. Many expect his younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, who has been described as a tyrant in waiting would take overher brother was no longer able to run the country. And anyone expecting a softer approach with a woman at the helm would be mistaken, according to experts. Prof Natasha Lindstaedt, an expert on totalitarian regimes, said: “I don’t believe that her being a woman will weaken her positionshe takes over as leader. “These people are not viewed or portrayed as even being human-like to the people of North Korea – as we have seen with Kim Jong-un. “They are presented as gods who can make everything better. “If she became supreme leader the same would apply to her and she would become god-like and every portrayal of her would do the same thing. “It is possible she will adopt an even harder line than her brother in dealing with the rest of the world because of the level of poverty. “There is nothing  – it is all they have. I do believe she is as tough as her brother and she has been very visible in recent times. “Often new leaders feel they must be tougher than the previous one.” Yo-jong shares a close relationship with her brother after they were both sent away to school in Switzerland. There shared a home where they had their own bodyguards and chefs are rarely mixed with other students. And despite her brother taking over the dynasty following their father, Kim Jong-ilaposs death in , Yo-jong has been groomed for power since she was a teenager. The -year-old was said to one of her fatheraposs favourite children, who was impressed by how clever she was, and arranged for her to be trained in the art of ruling from her teens. Kim Ki-nam, North Koreaaposs propaganda minister, was responsible for her education in the pursuit of power. Just a year after her brother came into power, Yo-jong began her ascent to the top. It is believed she was her brotheraposs tour manager although her TV appearances were still few and far between. But by , the leaderaposs sister was mentioned as a senior official in the Workeraposs Party of Korea for the first time. And in the October of that year, Yo-jong was chosen to stand in for her brother while he recovered from health problems. Ever since her brother came to power, Yo-jong is said to have been the person behind his public image, pushing the cult of personality. She is thought to be the driving force behind some of the more bizarre photoshoots her brother has taken part in, from riding on fairground rides to being pictured at a basketball game with NBA star Dennis Rodman. Yo-jong wants Kim to be seen as a man of the people and has worked tirelessly on his image since he came to power. From  she has been a prominent figure in North Koreaaposs supreme governing body, only the second ever woman to hold such a position. She was finally thrust onto the world stage two years ago when she was North Koreaaposs representative at the Winter Olympic Games on Seoul, South Korea. She was pictured sitting close to US Vice President Mike Pence and her rise as one of the leaders of government in North Korea seemed unstoppable. Following on from her success at the Olympics, Yo-jong was chosen to be part of her brotheraposs team during the North Korea and US Singapore Summit. She was also at his side during the North Korea and US summit in Hanoi, Vietnam the following year. The shine seemed to be fading from Yo-jongaposs star when she was removed from the hierarchy of the party for almost a year, only to be reinstated earlier this month - just before the rumours of her brotheraposs death surfaced.But even when she had been removed from the senior leadership of the party, there was little doubt of the importance of her role. When Kim Jong-un visited Mount Paektu, said to be the birth place of the dynasty, on horse back later last year, his sister was at his side.Rachel Lee, a former North Korea analyst for the US government, told the Financial Times : To your average, everyday North Korean, that is a pretty sure sign that she is a special person, that she is part of the Mount Paektu bloodline,” said Rachel Lee, a former North Korea analyst for the US government. Sung Yoong Lee, an American expert on the Koreas, added: “It is entirely possible Ms Kim would be even more tyrannical than her brother, father or grandfather.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kids under 10 can hug","story":"NewsKids under  can hug grandparents in Switzerland as they cant pass on coronavirusChildren aged under  in Switzerland have been allowed to visit their grandparents and give them a hug after scientists believe youngsters cannot pass on coronavirusShareCommentsByJeremy Culley:,  APR NewsThe move by the Swiss could indicate that primary schools could soon reopen \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

John-Paul Drike, the director of Drakes Supermarkets in Adelaide, Australia, says he responded simply by giving the alleged hoarder the middle finger. In a stunning YouTube video, the supermarket boss has vented his anger at those who have taken advantage of the desperate rush for basic household supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic. He claimed that one unidentied customer had been audacious enough to purchase  -roll packets of loo roll and  units of one-litre sanitiser from his shop - and then later ask for a refund. Follow the latest coronavirus updates here “I had my first customer yesterday who said he wanted to get a refund on  packets of -pack toilet paper and  units of one-litre sanitiser, Mr Drake says in his video on April . Flipping his middle finger at the screen, he added: “I told him that.  Branding those who have been panic-buying supplies such as toilet paper absolutely ridiculous, he continued: That is the sort of person that is causing the problem in the whole country. Speaking to News, he said the man wanted to get rid of the items because he was no longer able to sell them on eBay after his site was shut down. He claimed that he had as many as  people working with him to buy up the highly-sought after commodities. Australiaaposs Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton, has said that the government will come down like a ton of bricks on supermarket hoarders who have been clearing shelves of basic supplies. Speaking last month, he said that that anyone caught profiteering from buying up essential groceries such as food and toilet paper will be prosecuted. In the UK, police officers have taken to standing guard at supermarkets to halt coronavirus panic-buying and enforce the Governmentaposs social distancing orders.

Despite the campaign finishing nine matches short, we are delighted to announce the   Tele Sport Player of the Year for Dundee.The votes have been cast, averages for players having started  games vied up and there are no worries about emails turning up or not.The   Tele Sport Player of the Year is Paul McGowan for the second year running.After a very strong start, the midfielder’s influence grew throughout the season as the team got to grips with the Championship challenge. As ever, McGowan rarely fell below a seven out of  rating, finishing the season off with an eight after a wonderful assist for Kane Hemmings against Ayr, as well as key displays against Partick and an earlier showing against the Honest Men. After six years at the club, ‘Gowser’ is still going strong in dark blue.Fans favourite, Hemmings, ran McGowan very close with a strong run of form since the middle of December, breaking the -goal barrier in the final match against Ayr. Impressive showings in wins over Dunfermline and Partick in December stand out but his top display came back in October at a chilly Alloa, where the only disappointment was when he fluffed a chance to seal a hat-trick late on.The -year-old was a real star for manager James McPake after he gave him a regular run in the first team at the beginning of the campaign. Such a steady and unflustered player in the middle of the park, Robertson allowed the more experienced players to shine alongside him. That’s not stopped the teenager picking up regular good grades, in particular a fine showing against Dundee United at Tannadice in December.The first signing of the season, former Partick and Ayr winger, McDaid, showed dferent sides to his game last term. When the team struggled to create goalscoring opportunities early on, McDaid was still a regular threat and he’s shown his defensive capabilities more recently as a wing-back. His tackling in the area in derbies may need some work but McDaid will be determined that the best is yet to come from him in dark blue.Undoubtedly a class act in the middle of the park, Scotland international Dorrans showed glimpses of his best form throughout the campaign as he worked himself back to full fitness following y injury issues. The ex-Rangers man grabbed a vital goal at Tannadice in the - derby draw in December and was a driving force throughout.It seems defenders didn’t fare too well in   but make up almost the rest of the top .Honourable mentions go to Jordan McGhee ., Jordon Forster ., Jack Hamilton ., Shaun Byrne . and Jordan Marshall .."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.38225482-2-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.38225482-2-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.38225482-2-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.38225482-2-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"the feelgood feed stories to lift your day","story":"Things are tough right now — but the power of community has never been more important or more obvious.In every walk of le, people are coming together to ensure that no one is left to fight coronavirus alone.

new scheme to help crews moored in city","story":"Aberdeen Harbour Board has launched an initiative to help crews working on vessels moored in the port.The scheme allows vessels to book a four-hour welfare visit slot for their vessel, instead of making a full port call booking.The slot allows a vessel to stock up on essential supplies such as food, fuel, and critical spares during the coronavirus pandemic.Port operations manager John McGuigan said: “Fees for coming into the harbour are normally paid by the company chartering the vessel and they book a full port call to allow the vessel to be loaded with cargo.“During the Covid- crisis, however, when there is less work available, we wanted to support vessel owners and crews who are currently not on charter and to ensure their welfare throughout these unprecedented times.“We are calling the scheme Stow and Go but I guess it is a bit like booking your pick-up slot at the supermarket”.Harbour chief executive Michelle Handforth added: “We are very conscious of the impact that the current public health crisis is having, not only on our customers but also on the vessel owners and crews who support them.“While crews are in between work, they can spend signicant amounts of time out at the Aberdeen anchorage.“There are on average  vessels on any given day located there and we were keen to make the situation as good as possible for those crew who, along with those keeping the port open, are essential workers who are doing their bit in this crisis.”The scheme is open to all vessels at the anchorage and will be reviewed when the lockdown ends with a view to it being extended.It comes after Aberdeen Harbour said the port is still operational despite the “exceptional” circumstances."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53465794-1-240x180.jpg

As a result, whitefish and prawn sales have slowed since lockdown.And with no end in sight it is uncertain what the future holds for the fishing industry.Now, more than ever, fishermen are calling for help from their communities to stay afloat.Jimmy Buchan, one of Peterhead’s most famous fishing sons, has described the current battle as being a “silent war” on the business, one that he is hopeful the British public will help them overcome.He has spent his le at sea, but now sits as the chief executive of the Scottish Seafood Association.He is in no doubt that there will be lasting effects on the industry because of Covid- but is adamant that they can be overcome.He said:“We are at war with a silent invader, and people are fearful of their health.“We’ve locked down and habits have changed drastically. When people are shopping now they aren’t hanging about, and the result of that – across Europe – is that restaurants where people would be eating Scottish seafood have been lost overnight.“The effect that has had on the catching sector has been catastrophic.”Meanwhile, supermarkets have become the primary place for people to buy their weekly shop.But even there, restrictions are taking their toll.Peterhead is the largest whitefish port in the UK.There, fish is landed every day while the pandemic continues.An auctioneer guides only buyers around its market – through aisles of boxes spaced two metres apart – to sell the day’s catch.Likewise, the men buying stand further apart to fall in line with the market’s fresh safety policies.In the short-term, everyone is trying to continue on as normally as possible in an atmosphere Simon Brebner describes as “challenging”.Simon, the chief executive of Peterhead Port Authority, believes the town’s fishermen are up to the challenge put in place by Covid-.“Our market operation is continuing as normally as possible,” he explains.“We need all the help we can get just now, and what we need to ask is for the great British public to support our industries.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.38225482-2-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.38225482-2-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.38225482-2-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.38225482-2-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"aberdeen reveal 30000 community trust donation from atlanta united owner arthur blanks foundation","story":"The Aberdeen FC Community Trusthas received a , donation from billionaire Atlanta United owner Arthur Blank#s foundation.Atlanta and the Dons announced a strategic partnership last year and the Arthur M.

Everyone has got to engage and focus on that.“League reconstruction is important, in particular to certain clubs which it affects greatly, but we have to make sure we have leagues in the first place in football to go back to.“Football is going to be very dferent when we do get back to training and playing.“However, we have to have some form of competitive football out there.“It is too important to too many people and generates so much money.“We have got to keep clubs alive.“If we don’t get back playing then it is going to be really tough for clubs to survive this.“We need to focus on what we can do to get football back.“We have to be pro-active and put the necessary plans in place.“That means speaking to the broadcasters, to the SFA, SPFL and the government about trying to get football back going again and to see what that looks like.”A recent proposition by the SPFL board was eventually voted through by % of the  member clubs to call time on the three lower isions.The passing of that proposition also gave power to the SPFL board to end the suspended Premiership campaign and call champions and relegation.Aberdeen voted yes to the proposition, but only after Pittodrie chairman Dave Cormack received assurances from the SPFL that no call on the top flight season will be made without full consultation with all  Premiership clubs.The future of the Premiership remains uncertain, although following a meeting of UEFA’s executive committee last week the option to end a domestic season was opened up to member associations in “special cases”.That decision was made under representation from Scotland and Belgium.European leagues, including Scotland, have subsequently been given a deadline of May  by UEFA to provide plans to restart the - season.UEFA’s guidelines state leagues should be in a position to communicate by May  plans on a restart for domestic competitions. The executive committee will hold their next meet on May  where they intend to reach a decision on whether this season’s Euro competitions can be completed in August.Aberdeen recently issued a letter to the SPFL board, SFA and the other  Premiership clubs asking for a delay in calling time on the Premiership until the Reds conducted a feasibility study into playing the remaining fixtures of -.If that could be done behind closed doors the Dons would aim to find a way to broadcast all their games to their supporters.However, the price of testing players and staff could be prohibitive to closed door games.Medical chiefs at the  English Premier League clubs have decided players and staff be tested twice per week from when training resumes. Tests are £ each.McInnes said: “I think there is a general feeling among the top-flight clubs that we would like to fulfil the fixtures.“We all accept that when we go back there are going to be restrictions in terms of when and how we get fans back into the stadiums.“It is important we still have an open mind to finish the season, although I accept there could be dficulties in doing that.“In an ideal world we can get the season finished and then move on to the next one but we will need to see what happens.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 9 niblicks spoons and touchscreen carts","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Times BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things Golf are  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre.We have another question from #Our Listener# and we have more stats and golfing news.Martyn#s Monday Club got a surprise when they saw Oban#s golf prodigy Bob MacIntyre sporting their logo on his kit bag last week.Reporter Kathie Grfiths  catches  up with one of the # founding fathers# #  Robert Cruickshanks# of #Martyn#s Monday Club#  to find out what Bob#s support means to them.Since thriving Martyn#s Monday Club started-up, creating a safe place for both men and women to talk about their struggles,  lives have been saved and there will be more says Mr Cruickshanks  whose own son took his le in .Now there are hopes to meet up with Bob and invite him to be an ambassador.https:www.facebook martynsmondayclub Play or download the episode in the link below"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

We had people lined up to come and meet two of the dogs on the week that the country went into lockdown and had to cancel their appointments due to this.\"Also, Pal, who has been waiting for over a year for a new home, was due to go away to his new home that week which has had to be put on hold. And we have no idea when he can finally go to his new home.\"And the centre isnt just coping with the stress of caring for the animals during a crisis, theyre also facing potential financial strain as the weeks progress.\"Our centre relies heavily on income generated from our four shops,\" added Lee-Ann. \"Seventy per cent of our annual income is generated via the shops so loss of income is a real concern.\"We have had to cancel fundraising events during the key fundraising period of spring summer. This includes our Annual Dog Show in May which is one our biggest fundraising events.\"We are hopeful that not all staff go down with virus at same time.\"We are managing the situation to the best of our ability and [despite] that our weekly income has reduced very signicantly, and we need people to donate to help keep our centre operational whilst our shops are closed.\"All our animals are still being looked after and cared for by our excellent and committed staff.\"Sonia Graham from Borders Greyhound Rescue added: \"Were trying to make the best of the situation.\"We have  dogs at the moment because we cant get dogs in or out. Its dficult.\"Weve had some under fostering, but unless they are greyhound people they wont be going to foster.\"Its frustrating because for people who want dogs, youd think this was the perfect time to have one as theres time for one-on-one training.\"And a lack of volunteers is a key factor in the dficulties facing the Greyhound Rescue now, with the charity normally taking in up to  regular helpers to care for  dogs.\"Without volunteers, its been a real struggle,\" said Sonia. \"Were family-run and we have a farm too, so were just trying to fill the gaps left by volunteers.\"Another problem which has reared its head for Sonia and her family is the knock-on effect of this lockdown.Sonia explained: \"People who may have lost jobs or their business, they wont be thinking of taking on an animal.\"People cant afford to pay vet bills. I can see this being a dficult year.\"If anything, we may see animals being handed in. People will misjudge and panic about the situation. And it wont just be dogs being brought to rescues but being dumped.\"It will be interesting to see how this all works out.\"And to help ease the strain on the rescue, Sonia has created an Amazon wishlist for donations to help keep the dogs fed.The wishlist gives donors the option to either donate physical items, such as a bag of food, or they can gt a cash amount straight into the Greyhound Rescues account to spent on vital products.On the other hand, the Arthurshiel Rescue Centre, in St Boswells, hasnt seen an increase in their four-legged residents, with the charity manager Shona Middlemass saying: \"Were managing fine\".She added: \"Weve not had an influx of animals, any strays that get raised with us we share over Facebook.\"Fingers crossed everything keeps going smoothly, weve not had any problems.\"We dont have any cash coming in. Cat and dog boarding is our main source of income.\"Wed normally have five or six dogs, And Easter last year we were full with ten cats boarding.\"We rely on people going on holiday, and weve now had cancellation right up to July.\"However, the rescue has received some good news recently.Border Terrier Teddy, who went to a foster home last month, has been dubbed a failed foster, as he is likely to be kept by his foster family, finding his forever home.And its not just your average pets who are being impacted by the pandemic.The Scottish Borders Donkey Sanctuary, which was due to reopen for the Spring season in mid-March, still has donkeys available for adoption and sponsorship, and is operating as business as usual.John from the Sanctuary said: \"We hope to continue routine hoof trimming, tetanus booster injections , worming and de-lousingas and when they are due on a welfare basis.\"All the rescues are doing their best to meet social-distancing guidelines while also ensuring the well-being of their animals.Borders Pet Rescues Lee-Ann added: \"Please do not come to the centre and only contact centre by phone or email and the staff will help you as much as they can.\"If members of the public have any donations for the centre or charity shops, then we ask that you please keep them until it is safe to deliver them.\"People can donate via our Facebook and web page.\"For more information on these four rescues, you can find them at: Borders Pet Rescue, www.borderspetrescue.org Scottish Borders Greyhound Rescue, www.greyhoundtrust.org.uk Arthurshiel Rescue Centre, facebook Arthurshiel-Rescue-Centre- and The Scottish Borders Donkey Sanctuary, donkeyheaven.org"},{"url":null,"title":"ex-radio-borders-dj-went-rome-become-priest","story":"A Galashiels priest-in-training has spoken to the Borderabout his time in the Vatican and what it was like being filmed by the BBC for a new documentary, which is being aired this weekend.Former Radio Borders DJ Bobby Taylor was in his fth year at The Scots College in Rome when filming for the BBCs Priest School began in September . He is now coming to the end of his sixth year.The -year-old, whose mother is Catholic, had always had the inclination to become a priest, even applying to train before, but for reasons-unknown never followed up on these applications.It wasnt untilgoing to confession in Melbourne in , not long after the passing of his father two years earlier, that he started seeing a path to priesthood laid out clearly in front of him ndash particularly thanks to guidance from his own parish-priest in Galashiels.When we spoke to Bobby, who is back in Galashiels, he told us: \"Since filming ended, the most visible thing thats changed is that when were in Rome now were wearing collars.

The school has an approximate  percent drop-out rate as the young men learn more of what God is calling them to do, and as they face the sometimes hard-to-accept vows which they must take.\"Every guy is dferent,\" said Bobby. \"To be honest, Im not  percent sure  percent is the rate of drop out Ive experienced over the past few years Ive been there. Theres only been two or three guys out of - whove left.\"Me, personally, my first year was probably my toughest year. It was a big adjustment from that freedom I had, and having gone from earning quite a healthy wage working at sea, then going to seminary in a foreign country ndash it was quite a challenge.\"There was a period where I did have to really, seriously, pray about it and think about what I was being called to do.\"I think everybody goes through it, and I think its a good thing that everybody goes through because ultimately thats what seminary is about.,params: .push\"Seven years isnt a number plucked out of mid-air, its a period where youre doing a lot of study but youre also doing a lot of work to understand what it is youre being called to do, andits being called to priesthood because its not a light undertaking, its quite a serious undertaking ndash but a good one, and a positive one.\"And the problems facing Bobby and his fellow seminarians have only grown since the COVID- lockdown.He added: \"From about six weeks ago being in Rome and studying in the university with my class of about  other guys, Im now sitting in a dining room in a Catholic church house in Galashiels studying on my own.\"So things have changed quite a bit. But study still continues, its not like theyve stopped. Theres been a couple of weeks, this week and last week, which would have been the Easter holidays anyway.\"Although we may be spread out, back to our home countries, were still persevering with study.\"And in June, Bobby hopes to sit his exams which will see him move into his seventh year at the Scots College.

into it.I found a little information about it.It was located in Dam Brae and was said to contain water with special qualities that helped make a perfect pot of tea.There is little explanation as to what exactly these qualities were, but it seems to have been widely believed and accepted in the past.Tea, of course, became popular in Scotland, and by the th century it had become an important accompaniment to the often mundane diet of working class people, providing a refreshing non-alcoholic alternative to beer.For the poor, tea drinking wasnrsquot linked to formal social rituals as it was with the upper classes.Tea was the drink of the working class as they worked.So, a well in the heart of the town which was believed to supply good tea making water will have been a busy and popular place.Many people, likely mostly women, would have congregated around the well.In the OS name book from the s, it was clearly recorded that the well was listed as the ldquoVickerrsquos Well, but then goes on to state that ldquono person in the locality knows it by that name.Everyone called it ldquothe bickers well.Perhaps this was a result of local dialect changing the name over time.But Paul Bennet, in his interesting website ldquoThe Northern Antiquarian says ldquothere is the obvious possibility that the ldquobickers ndash as in chit-chat and gossip ndash related to it being where local folk simply met and chatted.Perhaps the reputation of the wellrsquos water for making quality tea also meant people from further afield considered it worthwhile to detour here, in order to make that extra special ldquoBickerrsquos Brew.One account says it was once surrounded by old trees.All of this conjures an image of an important social meeting place, with people meeting under the shade of old trees, exchanging views and information and having a good blether while they wait their turn to draw water from the celebrated well.Was the belief in the goodness of the water rooted in some older tradition Perhaps it was a revered holy well, as some have suggested It seems to have been associated with the vicarage of St Michaels nearby, which roots the well in Musselburghrsquos ancient past, and gives a reason for the name Vicarrsquos Well.The well was replaced by a pump sometime in the nineteenth century, and then was blocked up, and became forgotten.When Irsquod discovered all this I set out to find the location of the well to seethere was still any evidence of it.Dam Brae is now named Kilwinning Place and I studied a nineteenth century map which marked the exact location of the well, then compared it to a modern one and set out on my quest.I found the location. Irsquom sure of it, and took a photo.But there wasnrsquot really anything of much interest to see other than a slab on the ground where I believe the well once stood.It seemed so forgotten, and put me in a melancholy mood for a moment.I reflected on the way something that had been a tradition for so long, and such a part of many peoplersquos lives can just vanish, and be utterly forgotten.I know it was just a well and so might not seem important.But it was a meeting place for ordinary people for generations.The simple shared routines and places in our lives are often the ones we remember with nostalgia.We donrsquot think of them as history or worthy of recording until all memory has gone, and itrsquos too late.I thought about this as we were going on our local family walk this week.I suppose we all know we are living through a time that will be recorded by history.But when all this is over, and things are back to ldquonormal what simple things will you, and your family, remember from this time and what will you want remembered For me, this includes seeing the Greenhills carpeted with wildflowers for the first time that I can remember, watching children cycle on empty streets and deserted car parks, and queuing in shops, keeping our physical distance while also trying to stay social.For sure the toilet roll panic will be part of history.But all of us will have special moments and places that connect to the emotions of this time.There will be stories of peoplersquos wonderful community spirit, what it felt like to be confined in the house for weeks, and how we entertained ourselves.We are all historians of our own time, and we should find ways to record and remember the simple, but important, things we have felt and encountered during this time of crisis.Because memory fades, and as the fate of the Bickers Well shows,memories are not recorded or stories of them not told, they will be forgotten.And so this was why I decided to re-visit the story of the Bickers Well for my column this week.It may have originally seemed there was not much to tell about it.Yet once there was.But the memories and the stories connected to it seemed so simple and obvious at the time that nobody really thought them important enough to record or keep treasured.Now all that remains of those stories is a slab on the pavement.The technology we have makes it easier now to share and record our lives.So letrsquos use it to consciously be historians and storytellers of this dficult time to capture images and feelings, the happenings that may today seem too simple and commonplace to record, but in future will be a fascinating insight to our lives in this historic event.For me, that is the lesson of the Bickers Well."},{"url":null,"title":"winton-brewery-takes-countys-micropub","story":"Steve Holligan and David Mackinnon, from Winton Brewery, stepped behind the bar at Dunbarrsquos Station Yard Micropub at the beginning of the month.Currently, the duo are only allowed to sell off-sales, due to the coronavirus lockdown preventing customers from entering the pub, but they were looking forward to once again welcoming people inside as soon as possible.Steve said: ldquoWersquove been looking for a while to find something like this.ldquoThe Station Yard is unbelievable.ldquoWe looked in Haddington, we looked in Gullane and we wanted to stay in East Lothian, where we are from and where the brewery is based.ldquoIt was one of those things where you were scrolling through Facebook and this popped up.ldquoIt was too good an opportunity and we got in touch with Gerard McPhillips [who had created the pub alongside his late business partner David McGee] and had a really good meeting with him.

Instead, the site suggests mixing it with green tea as a natural toner.Should you be missing the skin-smoothing effect of an eye-watering beauty salon chemical peel, you may want to follow the online sitersquos alternative: granulated sugar, mixed with olive oil then a right good rub.For those who can spare some beer, its yeast content will help fight excessive sebum production and the bacteria that causes acne.Mix with egg whites and mashed strawberries then use as a face pack ndash or just pretend itrsquos a beery kind of meringue and eat it.While the websitersquos store cupboard treatments may seem a shade desperate, according to Claire Gray of Glasgow-based skincare specialist Ermana, there is real merit in seeking out a more natural approach to our skincare regimes.ldquoAt the moment, most of us are focused on shopping for essentials such as food and medicine, and skincare is often viewed as a luxury product, she says.ldquoBut all this time indoors and washing our hands is having an impact on our skin.For eyes strained from peering too long at Tiger King on Netflix, she has an age-old remedy: ldquoThe tannins in tea can help reduce puffiness and get rid of dark circles. Simply soak a tea bag in warm water and place on your eyes for  minutes.ldquoFor an astringent or toner, wipe a teabag over your face to tighten skin and then blot with a towel.With coffee shops closed and our espresso fix now confined to home, there is a use for all those spent coffee grounds. ldquoSimply add some coffee grounds to coconut oil to make your own at-home scrub, she says.ldquoThe coffee grains help remove dirt and dead skin cells and promote overall skin health, and the scrubbing action stimulates blood flow and can help to reduce cellulite.ldquoThe caffeine in coffee grounds has potent antioxidant properties that can help protect the skin from sun damage.While honeyrsquos antibacterial, anti-fungal and antiseptic properties mean it makes a handy face mask, so too do the fats, minerals and vitamins in mashed avocado.Pineapple is almost a skincare superfood: vitamin C, bromelain and antioxidants can help prevent and treat acne, fine lines, sun damage and uneven tone. Rub it on, leave for a few minutes and rinse off.Gray suggests therersquos even a skincare use for that bottle of apple cider vinegar lurking at the back of the cupboard. ldquoThe main ingredient in apple cider vinegar is acetic acid but it also contains lots of other natural alpha-hydroxy acids, she says.ldquoThese work together to gently exfoliate the skin by dissolving dead skin cells. Applying apple cider vinegar to the skin also delivers beneficial enzymes, proteins and good bacteria.With hand-washing a national hobby, she suggests taking particular care when choosing which soaps to buy.ldquoHandwashes contain water and any product with water has preservatives to stop it degrading. Andit says lsquoparfumrsquo on the bottle, itrsquoll have a multitude of sins.ldquoItrsquos much better to choose a natural soap, such as one made with olive oil.Helen Atherton of Edinburgh-based soap specialist, Dook, agrees that while washing hands with soap is a proven virus-killer, many harsh supermarket soaps will also wreck our hands.ldquoThe dference between a bar of handmade soap and a manufactured one is huge, she says. ldquoIn handmade soaps, the natural glycerine thatrsquos squeezed out in the industrial process is retained. So handmade soap is much kinder but will still destroy viruses.She uses coconut oil, shea butter, essential oils and Himalayan salt to make her organic soap, but strongly advises against attempting to break out the saucepans to rustle up your own bar.ldquoIf yoursquore not careful, homemade soap can go a bit rubbish ndash therersquos chemistry involved, caustic soda.

There is no other artist who documented Glasgow so extraordinarily during that period. Itrsquos not enough for Scottish art and big institutions like Kelvingrove to be limited to the most popular names like the Glasgow Boys, Jack Vettriano or Charles Rennie Mackintosh.ldquoPeople are very familiar with the work of the Glasgow Boys. But Glasgow has other painters. Therersquos a Glasgow Girl. Shersquos not even Scottish but came here and fell in love with the city to such an extent that she painted it throughout her short le. Eardley is a hugely important British artist and she should have a major exhibition in a British institution of note, like the Tate.Eardley was born on May , , on a dairy farm in Warnham, Sussex. Her family later moved to London and then, in , amid the growing threat of war, to Bearsden.The following year, she began her studies at Glasgow School of Art and proved fearless in her pursuit of subjects to paint. Her wanderings brought her to impoverished Townhead in the northeast of the city, where she established a studio. The paintings Eardley did there ndash particularly her famous portraits of the Samson children ndash are considered landmarks of th-century art.For her niece Anne Morrison, a Bearsden-based ceramicist, Eardleyrsquos relationship with an urban district which was facing the demolition ball is an example of just how daring and exceptional she was.ldquoTownhead was just not the area that you would go to ndash I was kept well away from it, she said. ldquoEven my brother, who was a couple of years older, said he had never been up there either. It was not the place to be. It was just the poverty and seeing what that part of Glasgow looked like. Middle-class kids just did not get taken there.ldquoShe actually caught something that was disappearing at the time, as the buildings were getting knocked down and people were getting moved where. It captured something of the city and the children there. Itrsquos not glorying it but itrsquos capturing it in a very human way.Morrison suggested that the lack of a major event to mark the centenary of Eardleyrsquos birth could have something to do with the Scottishness of her work.ldquoIt does seem right to have a celebration of her work but it does not seem to be happening, she added. ldquoHer name gets forgotten. She has not had the recognition at a UK level that she should. Thatrsquos the trouble. Shersquos a Scottish artist and she gets put aside because her subjects were Scottish as well.Laura Cumming, art critic for The Observer, described Eardley as ldquoone of the deepest landscape artists who ever lived, and among the most humanitarian painters of men, women and especially children.She added: ldquoEvery opportunity to see her work is precious ndash anywhere at all.ldquoThere have been shows in Scotland, the last that I remember was in . She deserves many more, and so the ideal would be a touring show that took in London, presenting her work throughout the United Kingdom to a new generation. Next year must not be allowed to slip by without a full-scale retrospective of her powerfully stirring and beautul work.Arts journalist Jan Patience said: ldquoThe National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh has done a power of work to cement her reputation with two major shows in the last  years, but there has been no major Eardley show for years in Glasgow, the city she called home. I believe the last one was in what was then called The Third Eye Centre in the s.ldquoAn Eardley show in Glasgow would attract visitors in their thousands and a no-show in her centenary year shows a real lack of vision.Local authorities in Scotlandrsquos largest cities said events were being organised or considered to mark the anniversary.A spokeswoman for Glasgow Le said: ldquoAs one of Scotlandrsquos most popular th-century artists we anticipate a small programme of events to mark Joan Eardleyrsquos centenary.ldquoWe are pleased to have a small number of her drawings and paintings in our collection, which includes the much-loved oil Glasgow Kids, a Saturday Matineacutee Picture Queue, on show in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. However, we do not hold the breadth of works required to stage a standalone exhibition.An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: ldquoEardleyrsquos work is showcased as one of the Our Collection highlights in Gallery  ndash Collecting Art and her work can be seen throughout the collections galleries. A number of the oils we own are on display, including a powerful seascape painted at Catterline.ldquoThe  centenary of Joan Eardleyrsquos birth presents a welcome opportunity for us to celebrate the artistrsquos strong connection with the northeast of Scotland in a number of ways.A spokesman for Leisure and Culture Dundee, which runs the McManus Gallery and Museum, said: ldquoWe have no current plans to mark the Joan Eardley centenary next year.A spokesman for the National Galleries of Scotland said: ldquoThe National Galleries celebrated the le and work of Joan Eardley in a comprehensive exhibition just three years ago, and the exhibitionrsquos curator Patrick Elliott, a leading expert on Eardley, is writing a book on Eardley and Catterline as part of the centenary celebrations. All future plans, including publication of this book and our exhibition schedule, are subject to review due to the ongoing health crisis. However, we do intend on marking Eardleyrsquos centenary next summer, in one form or another.The Tate galleries declined to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  The lockdown exit plan is ageist  Over-70s can decide what   s best for their health","story":"They are a mixture of the married, orced and widowed.

Maybe longer.Such a blanket policy surely has ageism at its core, regardless of how well-intentioned. How  do you explain the assumption that everyone over the age of  is weak and incapable of making decisions about their own health and wellbeing The evidence from UK Covid- wards suggests the average age of a critically ill patient is . Nine out of  have underlying conditions such as high blood pressure, obesity or type  diabetes. We also know, of course, this cruel illness can afflict, sometimes kill, young and fit people.Until a vaccine is widely available ndash an endeavour scientists believe may take  months or more ndash many people with underlying health conditions of every age group will obviously want to take maximum care and precautions to prevent exposing themselves to danger. They accept, hard as it may be, that they wonrsquot be able to leave home. Others wonrsquot have the mental capacity to make these decisions for themselves.But what about over-s that are fitter, healthier and more active than their younger relatives and friends  And what about older people who do suffer from underlying health problems but would rather take a dferent approach once restrictions start to be lted They may decide it is worth leaving home, spending time with grandchildren and friends, going shopping, evenit means an increased chance of catching the virus. They may be willing to accept the associated risks and consequences.Whatrsquos so galling is the idea that no-one over  can or should decide for themselves what risks they are willing to take with their own health and wellbeing.One of most interesting aspects of this crisis has been the way it has forced all of us to examine and question what makes le worth living. Many of us, myself included, will have come to the conclusion that social contact, time spent with other human beings, is the most precious thing in our lives.This is certainly the case for most of the older folk I speak tonow, especially those who have lost their partner and or live alone. Spending time with children, grandchildren, siblings and pals is what keeps them going. It doesnrsquot take a PhD in psychology to work out that Skype and Zoom will only suffice for so long.I was walking in an empty Glasgow city centre recently and the saddest thing of all was the absence of the cheery bands of elderly ladies and gents that usually frequent Sauchiehall Street on week days, comparing prices and purchases, enjoying a cuppa and a scone, or a pint. The thought of them home alone indefinitely, stoic as they may be, is heartbreaking. For some in care homes, extended isolation will be torturous.Itrsquos one thing ordering people to live without friends and family for a few weeks. Itrsquos something  entirely telling them to do so for months, maybe years. Even for their own good. Some, especially those in the autumn of their lives, may understandably decide it is a sacrice they are not willing to make.There has been much talk recently about treating people like adults. This must include the over-s, who, letrsquos face it, have been grown up for longer than anybody .To be clear, I am not advocating reckless breaking of current lockdown rules. Irsquom saying we need a sensible approach to what comes next, one that doesnrsquot discriminate against the elderly.

Lord, thank you for Tom Hardy.Sorry, did you think I meant Boris Johnson  Thatrsquos the trouble with narrators ndash some are unreliable.The Prime Minister did have a tale to tell on histo work yesterday, but it was one we have heard so often in recent days .It was pretty scary, too, with mention of second spikes and maximum risk, and we could all do with a little less of the terrying stuff, thank you. Still, good to see him back.It was even nicer, though, to see Tom Hardy rock up once more in the Bedtime Stories slot on CBeebies last night.

For these are tales specially chosen for lockdown times.The first story, Hug Me, by Simone Ciraolo, is about a lonely cactus. Under The Same Sky by Robert Vescio and Nicky Johnston looks at being far apart from friends, while Donrsquot Worry, Little Crab by Chris Haughton reassures children about trying new things.

Of course, during the present lockdown, like everyone , my le has changed, and of course I understand why and have accepted the restrictions, but it cannot be sensible or fair to continue these restrictions for one particular group.

Being over  Ive lived through ious risks, from managing as a student to escape a stabbing Glasgowrsquos Byers Road from a thug in the Young Partick Cross gang to scaling Blencathra and Sharp Edge a few years ago. Le is full of risk and looking at the deaths on British roads, does that mean youd never drive anywhere I feelIm confined to my house for another  months le would not be worth living. Im prepared to take acceptable risks and obey social distancing when the general lockdown is lted. Similarly, will the Government stop people mountaineering, motorcycling, scuba ing, paragliding and the like to prevent death or injury or being a burden on hospitals Ivor Matheson, Dumfries.AS an -plus guy who up until a few weeks ago was out five days a week on volunteering duties how I agree with Marianne Taylors article. I am fortunate to have good health but the thought of Boris Johnson or Nicola Sturgeon continuing the lockdown for over-s fills me with abject horror and I think rather than prolonging my le it would in fact shorten it and I am prepared to take a risk with my own health and wellbeing.Alan Stephen, Glasgow G.I AGREE wholeheartedly with Ian Johnstone . I will soon be , and probably like many older people, have been social distancing to some extent for the last  years. As you age, you become much more aware of your own mortality and are making risk assessments on almost a daily basis about places to go and activities to follow because you appreciate you are more vulnerable to all sorts of situations and activities ndash for example, shopping centres, buses, trains, supermarkets, gyms, large gatherings, planes, cruise ships and the like where germs are easily spread and accidents can happen and plan your le accordingly.Also, as we age we tend to take each day as it comes, make the most of it and are thankful for it as we realise our time is limited and dont know what is round the corner. Please dont shut us in for months on end. We have lived a full le with all its ups and downs and coped with many distressing situations and experiences in our lives. We are not stupid. We know that our time is limited and we want to make the most of it but we are also very capable. Dont shut us in for months on end and take some of that le away from us. It might be the last chance some of us get!Margaret Sweeney, Johnstone.ldquoARE you listening, Nicola Sturgeon , asks James F McGilvray at the end of his letteron aspects of the lockdown. I am sure that Ms Sturgeon is listening. She will be listening to the team of medical and scientic experts who are tasked with advising her.The golf courses and the lochs will still be there when this pandemic is over so we all simply need to be patient. There will be many people, like the armchair football managers, who think they know better, but when the world is in crisis we need to trust the advice of the experts.David Clark, Tarbolton.PETER Russellis a little disingenuous with his comparison of the deaths being caused by the coronavirus just now, with the number of deaths that would be caused by an ldquoextended economic depression. These are not the appropriate comparators.The present lockdown restricts social interaction to an all-time low, but should we prioritise the needs of the economy, and loosen the lockdown, or have no lockdown at all, the level of social interaction would be increased, vastly so in the case of the latter. In that event the number contracting the virus, and thus the number of deaths, could be expected, through greater and wider exposure, to increase, and it is that figure which some estimates have described as ldquobiblical, which should be used to compare to the number who might die as a result of \" extended economic depression.At some point the lockdown can be safely modied, but this must be done with the greatest care. The needs of the economy are critical, but should be set against the wider health needs of the community, as this genie will not easily be put back in the bottlewe allow it to escape into the wider community.Given all of this, Mr Russellrsquos conclusion that ldquoMaybe we have reached it [the point where the economic consequences are worse than the lockdown] already seems not just unlikely but reckless.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.LOOKING at the picture accompanying Alison Rowats article showing the people in Sweden enjoying fresh air and sunny weatherleads me to think that their health will benefit from this simple freedom, whereas in the UK people are being actively discouraged from being outside to any great extent. I am sure the benefits of being out of doors as the seasons progress helps everyone to shake off winter ailments as we build up our vitamin D levels and strengthen our immune systems.Duncan Miller, Lenzie.IT is welcome news that the First Minister is considering a new approach and additional powers to deal with the coronavirus . We have been digging a deeper hole for ourselves by following the UK approach with its half measures and tentative attempts to limit the spread of the disease.It is not surprising that the lockdown is reported to be crumbling in places, as people have no clear idea of what we are supposed to be achieving ndash are we crushing the virus or just slowing it down In contrast, countries which acted decisively with strict measures are now becoming clear of it ndash from Greece to China. The world will soon ide into such \"clear\" countries and others where the disease threatens to become endemic. It is imperative that Scotland is not in the second category.Much of our economy here is dependent on services. Hospitality, tourism and education would all be greatly damaged. The thousands of students we teach from the Far East would prefer to go to \"clear\" countries such as Australia and New Zealand. It is folly to continue as we are and we must now mobilise our population in a total effort to suppress the virus.Professor Greg Philo Glasgow University, Glasgow G.WELL, this isnrsquot good. The US, population  million has reported , deaths from the virus. The UK population, at  million, has reported , deaths, so with one-fth of the US population, we have pro-rata, comfortably, the highest death rate from the virus in the world.

Thanks to them, wildle and livestock are safer, burns cleaner, the undergrowth no longer unsightly and depressing.Irsquove always been intrigued by those who donrsquot feel their patch ends where their property meets the pavement. For such folk, the mental map of where their obligation or responsibility lies stretches far beyond the obvious bounds of self-interest. Most of us like to keep our own house in order, but those who are outward-looking are protective of a much wider area. The same goes for helping others. For some, the family circle is as far as their antennae reach. Others respond to those in need whom theyrsquove never met, or ndash through charitable giving especially ndash whose names theyrsquoll never know.Who can say what state the economy will be in when this virus goes into retreat, nor how long it will take to recover. None of the predictions makes cheerful reading, so it seems reasonable to assume that, for a period at least, there will not be an abundance of cash in council coffers. They were hardly overflowing a year ago but with the likelihood of a serious fiscal downturn, shoestring budgets will grow even more threadbare.Around these parts, people are stepping up, not just to collect refuse or plant bulbs by the roadside, but to mow communal areas of grass, strim embankments and de-litter waterways and bridlepaths. You could say that most of this is the councilrsquos responsibility, and yoursquod be right. At a certain point, however, it becomes a pernicious and self-defeating outlook always to expect others to get things done when you could simply get up and do it yourself.So, while this is not intended to suggest letting local government off the hook, whenever essential services come under threat ndash rural buses and post offices, libraries, care packages ndash those of us with time, imagination and inclination can surely help plug the gap, evenonly in the short-term.Thanks to the current volunteer force, I foresee a future when, with the memory of Covid  fading, initiatives intended to get us through this emergency will live on and help communities flourish. After all, the benefits are not solely for those who at the receiving end. Helpers get the immense satisfaction of knowing they are being useful.

from the air sometimes and flows from our taps when we want it.ButCovid- has brought us anything, itrsquos the opportunity to step back and think about the things we take for granted. Irsquom going to suggest that water should be one of these.Water, after all, affects our daily lives as much as anything, impacting our health, environment, housing, communities and economy.So how do we keep the systems and structures that constitute water management in Scotland fit for purpose  And crucially, is the cost of maintaining them spread fairly Providing wateracross Scotland requires a vast infrastructure of pipes, pumping stations and treatment works, not to mention a small army of staff and a large supply chain.Since , Scottish Water has serviced this network from the Borders to the Shetland Isles, responding to the challenges of topography, remoteness, weather patterns and general wear and tear of those assets.Every six years, industry stakeholders review customer charges and agree on how much the industry needs to deliver water and sewerage services. The latest review period is just concluding.Future challenges for Scottish Water include achieving net-zero emissions by , building resilience to deal with greater rainfall during winter and less in the summer, and population sht from the west of Scotland to the east.None of this will come cheaply. Indeed industry stakeholders have accepted that customer prices during - will have to rise beyond inflation. So how are these costs split across households We pay our water charges along with our council tax. So what you pay for your water and sewerage depends on which council tax band you are in.Financial assistance is available for those who are vulnerable, but the current policy for allocating this assumes that lower income households will live in lower band properties: so the lower the band, the less you pay. Additionally,you receive council tax reduction, you automatically qualy for a reduction in your water charges, up to a maximum of  per cent.At Citizens Advice Scotland, we have a statutory role in monitoring all this, with a specic brief to protect the consumer interest. Our research has revealed that household income, not council tax banding, is a more accurate proxy for identying those that may struggle to pay for their water charges.The relationship between income and council tax band is weak low incomes donrsquot only exist in lower council tax banded households. There are also cash poor, asset rich households in higher council tax bands.We have identied those who pay over % of their income on water charges as those most in need of support. And currently, only % of this group in Scotland qualies for any reduction. If in future, water charges increase above any growth in their income, then more than % of the lowest income households will pay more of their weekly income on water charges. Just one more bill they canrsquot afford.However, consumers have also told us that they support investment to tackle climate change and to ldquofuture proof water infrastructure and service delivery. So how do we reconcile the need to generate enough income for Scottish Water in the longer term to improve customer services and protect the environment, whilst protecting low income households  How do we achieve a just transition to net-zero Is it fair to ask low income households to pay for the decarbonisation of the water industry, or should we be looking for a way to ensure it is funded by those who can afford to pay There are two possible ways to support low income households. The current system, basing affordability purely on council tax banding, can be improved by linking the reduction scheme for water and sewerage charges to any increase in customer bills, particularly above inflation prices. This would help ensure that low income households are not left out of pocket.In the longer term, however, we would support a new system that links a householdrsquos weekly income or wealth with their council tax band when determining who should receive assistance. This would better target support to those who need it most.It is generally accepted that le after Covid- will look very dferent to le before it. Many areas of public policy and practice will need to be looked at, including the way we fund our water services. There is an opportunity to design more robust measures that will protect low income households on a more permanent basis.Gail Walker is water policy manager at Citizens Advice Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"April ,  at : amNorthern Isles parliamentarians have called on Scottish Ministers to fully consider and openly engage with all potential approaches to easing lockdown restrictions, including those with an alternative strategy specic to the isles.

However, concerns have been raised about the impact of this transfer, as well as obstacles in the way of securing new ship orders and Powers of Attorney.The Justice Secretary acknowledged these concerns, and offered to pursue the issue with the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service.Mr McArthur said: “Nothing is ‘business as usual’ at the moment, and the well-being of court staff and the wider public has to be the number one priority.  However, there are many aspects of civil court business that we cannot afford to put on pause.“Over recent weeks, I have been contacted by local solicitors in Orkney, extremely concerned at the dficulties they have faced in getting urgent business completed.  Delays in getting a new ship Orders or Powers of Attorney in place, for example, can have serious consequences. Vulnerable people rely on effective and timely court processes that make sure their rights are properly safeguarded.“In England and Wales we are seeing technology being used to enable more court business to be undertaken. There is no reason why a similar approach cannot be adopted in Scotland.  Indeed, Sherf Courts already conduct procedural hearings by tele-conferencing.“The justice secretary insists that progress is being made, but has offered to take up these concerns with the Scottish Court and Tribunals Service.

This might included certain businesses being allowed to reopen where customers can safely stay at a two metre distance, and the reformatting of classrooms before pupils canto schools.The First Minister has advised that restrictions are likely to continue in some form for at least the rest of this year, and possibly beyond that.She added that the Scottish Government would be relying on the latest data to inform it of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing. When asked about whether certain regions of Scotland might undergo a more localised approach, the First Minister said she wasn#t ruling out anything that might help us deal with the virus.#Today I am seeking to start a grown up conversation with the public about the complex decisions that lie ahead of us as we look beyond lockdown,# she said.“As we have done all along, we will seek to inform the public with the best scientic advice possible, but the science will never be exact and we are in uncharted territory so we also need to make careful judgements and be prepared to adapt and change course as we go.“We want to ease restrictions, but we cannot rule out having to reapply them should the virus run out of control.#Nicola Sturgeon said she and her colleagues would be relying on the latest data to inform them of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing.“Every day we see evidence that this virus causes real harm, but so too do the lockdown measures we are taking to contain it,# she continued.#This is causing harm to the economy and living standards, to children’s education and to mental health and wellbeing.“That is why we need to try to find a better balance than the one we have now, but as we do so we cannot take our eye off the need to suppress the virus and minimise the damage it does.“It is only when we are sure the virus is under control that we can even start to ease any of the restrictions because the virus will not have gone away.#Nicola Sturgeon has advised everyone to take part in the conversation about how we might leave lockdown.

The academic suggested that the next stages of coronavirus containment could be developed earlier in the islands # but onlya comprehensive testing strategy was in place.Orkney and Shetland’s parliamentarians, Liam McArthur MSP, Alistair Carmichael MP and Beatrice Wishart MSP have called on the Scottish Government to provide assurances that they will engage meaningfully with Professor Pennington’s proposals and be open to considering how they might be implemented safely.Mr McArthur said: “Public safety must be paramount as decisions are taken about how and when the current restrictions might be lted.“In that context, however, Professor Pennington’s suggestions, which have already attracted a great deal of interest in Orkney and other island communities, deserve serious and urgent consideration.“If the Scottish Government genuinely want to treat the Scottish public ‘as grown ups’ then suggestions like these need to be dealt with in a transparent manner.“I have already written to both the Health Secretary and the First Minister to make this point, and to seek clarity on what consideration is being given to a more localised approach for the islands.  It is important that all options to tackling the coronavirus remain on the table during this unprecedented time.”Mr Carmichael added: “I hope that the Scottish Government will engage with these proposals seriously. That engagement must, however, also include close cooperation and discussion with local communities to ensure public confidence in safety.“This is not a plan that can be run centrally. Local input and know-how is key and islanders should be at the heart of how we translate these proposals into action.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Until late last year, a suitable vessel proved dficult to source, said the council.It then became known that the Nordic Sea, which operated on a number of passenger routes in the far north of Norway, had become available.Following visits and sea trials involving Orkney Marine Services and Orkney Ferries staff, the vessel was considered as a suitable replacement for the Golden Mariana.As the Nordic Sea was operating under a Norwegian Passenger Certicate, it was known that a number of requirements would have to be met before she was considered ready for a UK passenger certicate.With surveys now completed and a works list developed, the decision to complete the purchase was made and the vessel departed Bergen for Orkney yesterday morning, Thursday.On arrival, the vessel was handed over to Orkney Islands Council, but due to Covid- restrictions and the need for some works to be carried out to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication, it will be a while yet before the residents of Papa Westray are able to benefit from their new passenger ferry.The purchase of the new vessel was part funded by the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland.More details in The Orcadian Marine Scene section next week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

For urban wildle, which includes mammals and birds living alongside people in towns, this will affect levels of disturbance from humans and food availability.In recent weeks there have already been reports of animals adapting to the reduced human activity including Kashmiri goats roaming around Llandudno, North Wales, troops of monkeys in Singapore, wild boars in cities across Europe and Coyotes wandering streets during daylight hours in the US.Lead researcher Professor Dawn Scott, an expert in Mammal Ecology and Conservation, will use this unprecedented time to try to collect information and answer the study’s overarching question # How have urban animals responded to changes in human activity during the COVID- lockdown The research will collect records on any observations of unusual animal behaviour during the lockdown, determine the effects of reduction in human activity in city and town centres on urban wildle, and the effects increased human activity in gardens and outdoors space is having. The data from the survey will then be combined with other data from media searches to produce a report on the response of urban animals to lockdown across the globe.Professor Scott, head of the School of Le Sciences at Keele University, said: “Urban animals have been able to adapt to our landscape and live alongside towns, cities and suburbs so we know they are already highly adaptable. This flexibility in behaviour means they can usually quickly respond to changing conditions, including the absence of humans, which is happening during the lockdown.“Across the world we have seen reports of animals roaming cities and in locations that they wouldn’t normally be seen during the day. Social isolation is an opportunity for many to learn more about nature and how we can support it. We’re asking people to take part in our study and help us discover how urban animals are responding due to our change in behaviour.”To find out more and take part in the study visit: www.keele.ac.uk wildlestudycopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years.

This technology exists. If we simply used the electricity to generate hydrogen, and store it just like the old city gas, we can run all our power needs through hydrogen fuel cells. Simple, cheap and clean. Or we could let global heating destroy our children#s future because nobody wants to see a big windmill near their property.

Have a nice evening, do.Love it, thanks JT 🙂No real need for fuel cells. Hydrogen was % of coal gas, can be stored in gasometers and burnt in gas fires and used to power piston engines, gas turbines and most conventional heating systems. A hell of a lot cleaner than burning wood chip. Now forget the windfarms, obsolete technology, use tidal generation and mini modular nuclear.That way we will have a living planet worth saving, not a mass of concrete, steel and fibreglass.I#m not sure windfarms are quite obsolete yet# with the technology that is available at scale onshore wind is the cheapest source of new electricity. Perhaps not on peat bogs though. That#s not to say we can#t do better with other renewables.PS circa Dads Army, I am not that old!!!At  dollars a barrel so called renewables will need to reduce costs by a huge margin to compete with oil. At the current oil price of less that  dollars a barrel wind, tidal and solar no hope.Renewable energy is not produced in barrels. Where did you hear that We continue to burn oil and gas because the infrastructure is there and the investment has been made. But when it comes to investing in new electricity generation, onshore wind is the cheapest. Also # I am not sure how such a low price is beneficial to the oil industry what with their high fixed costs As a patriotic Brit I am all for us standing on our own two feet and generating cheap and reliable energy. Shetland aside, as a nation we are net importers of oil and gas. Why rely on the likes of Russia or our Middle Eastern friends when we can spend that money at home and have jobs for Brits producing clean and plentul energy  Let#s stop living in the s. Let#s have clean, reliable British energy instead.I tend to lean in the direction indicated by John Thomas.For reasons of cheapness , safety and reliability I can’t see why wind and tidal forces should not be the primary options for energy generation. Winds are unlikely to stop blowing and sea tides are unlikely to dry up , so how can they not be major considerations Nuclear power is also in the running provided that the associated risks can be accepted. No matter what the no doubt wellintended may suggest, there ARE risks which do not raise their ugly heads with wind and water. Reliable , sustainable , and non polluting.

I tried keeping them in all day but I ended up with an ear infection.I tried noise-reduction headphones – very expensive – but anything to keep out that incessant -decibel shrieking.I even tried wearing them whilst gardening and playing an early Queen album at full volume: “Sheer Heart Attack” – that should drown it out,it doesn’t give me one …What next I was so sensitive, or to give it its psychological name – “sensitised” – that I could even pick out the faintest suggestion of a chaffinch on a TV programme.It might be while watching the golf or some Jane Austen adaptation with a scene near some trees – and that blooming chaffinch was there in the background. Why doesn’t anybody  notice it What next  What next to do  Chop all the trees down around the house, down to ground level – that’s what next to do.And so I take an axe and like a deranged lumberjack, I fell every Sitka spruce within earshot.I cut down the white fuchsia to within feet of the ground, and the sessile oak and the sycamores and the rowan and the Swedish whitebeam – the lot, all down to within a few feet of the ground.That should do it. Just tell everyone it’s to give the deciduous trees more space, and the coppicing of what’s left will make them grow all the stronger.And then, next spring – all potential perching sites cleared from near the house….but the traffic!You open the door and there is a car stopped, looking at us and we look out of the window and there is a car stopped looking back at us….What a state to be in!Quick – replant some mature trees to provide an instant screen. The Christmas trees from past years with root balls still intact – they should do it and that escallonia and the New Zealand holly – evergreens to block the view of the road.This is madness. One month I am cutting down all the trees the next month I’m desperate to put them back!There is humour here.Someone calls when the trees have disappeared only to find that when next they visit, just months later, the trees are back again – some fully grown.Complete amazement: “Things don’t half grow fast here!”Thankfully, it’s an episode from the distant past.Time is a great healer I gradually managed to rewire my brain circuits and become habituated to the noise of the chaffinch.I can laugh at it now, but it shows how fragile and vulnerable the human mind can be.And so to the news that’s on everyone’s mind – coronavirus.As someone over , I am trying to minimise the risk of catching it and passing it on. Self-isolating is a daunting prospect and who knows how long this lockdown will last and what the future will bring I am reminded of that classic story from : “The Monkey’s Paw” by WW Jacobs. “Without, the night was cold and wet … ‘Hark at the wind … Path’s a bog and the road’s a torrent.”Gosh! This is far too close to home.The tale has been adapted many times for radio, television, film and theatre, and the full short-story text is available on the Internet.In the present circumstances it would be in poor taste to dwell on the details.Suffice it to say, the message is a salutary one, beginning with the anonymous quote: “Be careful what you wish for, you may receive it.”As I sit here in this eerie quietness – no more tourist traffic rumbling by and stopping outside our gateway – I cannot escape the jarring irony.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ben-ak-wind-farm.jpg","title":"renewables firm launches support fund for north west skye","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineHouseholds in North West Skye will be able to access grants of up to £ to help them through the coronavirus crisis thanks to a new major pledge from a renewable energy firm.has announced a fund for the communities around its windfarms to help alleviate the impact of the Covid- outbreak.The company is donating £, to be shared between the community benefit trusts which administer funds from its  wind farms in Scotland, England and Wales.Jason Bold, Chair of Dunvegan Community Trust who administer the funding from Ben Aketil Wind Farm, said: “Whilst we navigate these challenging circumstances in our rural community, Falck Renewables Covid- grant has offered us much needed funds to collaborate with local groups.#Dunvegan Community Council has been very responsive and progressive to set up a Community Fund, which we are proud to back with Falck’s kind support.”The Trust has joined forces with Dunvegan and District Community Council to establish a community fund offering financial support to anyone in the community council area experiencing financial hardship due to the Covid  virus.Grants will be generally given to support immediate needs and be limited to £ per household.The community fund will be facilitated and regulated by Skye and Lochalsh Citizens Advice Bureau.John Laing, chair of Dunvegan and District Community Council, said: “The Dunvegan Community Council are aware of the dficulties many iniduals and families are experiencing during these exceptional times.#We have launched the Dunvegan Community Fund to assist those in our community who are in need of assistance as a result of the Covid  virus and are delighted to have generous support of The Dunvegan Trust and Falck Renewables whose generous support have made our fund possible”Managing Director of Falck Renewables UK, Richard Dibley, said: “We have a close relationship with the communities around our wind farms and their response to the current challenging situation has been as proactive and heartwarming as we would have expected.#They are already involved in helping the people and organisations in their area who need it most and we were keen to support them.”Dunvegan Community Trust has also made a £, donation to the Skye and Lochalsh Community Food Bank.Food bank chair Davina McCluskie said: “We are very grateful for the grant from the Dunvegan Community Trust which will go a long way in helping those in need.  We have seen an increase in users at the foodbank and I fear we will see many more in the coming weeks.#We have no paid members on the food bank committee #

The shields, have proved such a hit with young patients and staff there are plans to extend their use in more wards.Mark Hanna from Limavady Memorials wanted to help with the shortage of Personal Protection Equipment for front line medical staff so he bought machinery to make face-shields.When an appeal was made for specialist face-shields for children, Mr Hanna asked a friend to source images and after making a few adaptations to make the images fit the standard masks, he was soon in production.Speaking to the Belfast , he said: We started making face-shields about -days-ago when we self-funded the machines because we wanted to do what we could to help.We were making the standard shields, but we didn#t have images to make the child friendly ones but a friend sourced those, and we worked with the artwork and adapted them to fit the ones we were already making. We made face-shields that have ious cartoon and superheroes images most children would be familiar with, and we have princess crown and unicorn ones too.My we is a rapid response nurse, so she was able to take a few samples into the Emergency Department and the two children#s ward where they went down really well.In fact they went down so well, the theatre ward is looking for them as well.Laura Kyle, Nursing Sister in Altnagelvin#s Emergency Department, said the face-shields are going a long way in reducing fear and stress in children at what is a very dficult time for them.She said: Coming into hospital is stressful for a child at any time but now it is particularly terrying.Although we have only just begun using these masks, we can see the dference they are making to the children already.It was a great talking point for the children and it is a great way for us to explain why we are wearing the face shields.The children#s wards have them as well but I know colleagues from theatre, intensive care and day units want to order them too.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But some students at the South Eastern Regional College#sanimal management course have taken on some rather unusual friends into their homes.The animals usually live in the college#s Animal House but since lockdown they have had to move out and in with the students.Julie Armstrong, animal management lecturer, said: We have a whole array of creatures who live in SERC#s Animal House, giving our students hands on handling, observation and care access to everything from mice and rats to Guinea pigs, geckos and a tortoise.She continued: When we put the call out to see who could take on responsibility for looking after the animals, we were delighted with the enthusiasm and support from the students and indeed one of our animal technicians who took on our  resident mice.Mother-of-four Leanne Reid from Newtownards, whose children are aged from three to , is a first year student on the course. Her house is no stranger to animals - but now she has taken on even more.Leanne said: My house is a bit of a menagerie in any case as we already have four rats, two dogs and a cat, so taking on the three College rats, Butch, Marcellus and Joules, didn#t seem like too big an ask.We are all passionate about animals and the kids love having the new rats who have settled in well.I know some people are probably cringing about the thought of having any kind of rat as a pet but I have kept them since I was in high school - I used to take them to the local shop with me on my shoulder.They are really like having a wee dog and have their own little personalities and once they are out of their cages they settle down and are well behaved. They do like to be out and about.She added: As a mature student ing to education, I have been really thankful for all the support and encouragement that the lecturing and support staff have given me, so I have been delighted to be able to help out by offering to look after the animals in this way.Fellow student Nathan McKee, from Bangor, has taken on a couple of African Clawed Frogs.While Robyn Woods, also from Bangor, has brought home a couple of crested geckos and Norman the tortoise.She said: I feel privileged to have been able to take them in and provide them with a warm holiday home while supporting the college during lockdown.Hermione and Jason, the college Guinea pigs, have taken up residence with Naomi Perry from Newtownards.Meanwhile Laura Leabody, animal technician at SERC, has taken on  mice.She said: Having the mice home during this challenging time has provided excellent quality time in terms of handling and behavioural observations.New behavioural records have now been completed based on nocturnal activity which is something I wasn#t able to do before and I am looking forward to sharing these with the students during the online lessons.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Dr Tony Holohan said they were one of the measures we are giving consideration to.Foyle MP Mr Eastwood, however, called on Stormont to follow Scotland#s example and advise people to wear face masks or coverings in enclosed public spaces where social distancing is dficult.It#s important that people are provided with the best advice to help them contribute to the effort to prevent further transmission of Covid- and help save lives, he said. The Scottish Government has now issued clear advice that members of the public should wear face masks in enclosed spaces where social distancing is unavoidably dficult to achieve, like in small shops.Our Executive should consider offering the same advice to people in Northern Ireland, the vast majority of whom are abiding by lockdown restrictions and want to help beat this outbreak. It#s no silver bullet, but it will help prevent transmission where people are in close contact. We have all experienced worry in enclosed spaces when people are unintentionally closer together than they#d like to be. Masks or coverings will help.Northern Ireland#s Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said any benefit from wearing face coverings would be marginal at the very least.What we must not lose sight of is the important message thatyou are symptomatic, you and your entire family need to self isolate. That is the most important point. It#s hugely important that we still adhere to the guidance to stay at home and only in limited circumstances should you leave your home, he added. The most important thing to do when you leave home is to adhere to the advice on physical distancing and on good respiratory and hand hygiene.Wearing a mask must not be seen as a substitute for adhering to that advice. There is some limited evidence thatyou are in an enclosed space and unable to adhere to the advice on social distancing, the wearing of some form of face covering may be of benefit, but the benefit is marginal, to say the very least.The recommendation on face masks issued by Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon on Tuesday appears to contradict earlier advice from Scotland#s national clinical director. Professor Jason Leitch said on April : The global evidence - and we#ve looked properly, I promise you - is that masks in the general population don#t work. People don#t wear them properly, they#re hard, they#re dficult and they#re uncomfortable.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, the Department of Health said it was committed to developing a fair and effective scheme for providing le assurance.But Dr Tom Black said the scheme announced by Health Secretary Matt Hancock means certain groups of doctors will not receive their full pension entitlement in a move he described as penny-pinching by the Westminster government.He also said he was no longer willing to put forward doctors to work in Covid centres or wards because their family would not receive the usual entitlementsthey died.We will instead, and this is what we have been doing for the last month, we will put forward older doctors like me who are more at risk because governments won#t pay a pension to the widows of the younger doctors, that#s not acceptable, he said, speaking to the BBC#s Talkback programme.Dr Black said that when the Covid pandemic emerged all healthcare workers stepped into the breach.Nobody hesitated, there were problems with PPE, we took it on the chin and kept working, he said.He claimed doctors will now be disadvantagedthey die in those circumstances after normally expecting to receive double their annual pay and approximately half their pension. Certain groups of doctors such as GP locums or people who are out of the pension scheme, retired members who came back or very young doctors who are in the first two years of their career, those groups will not get that.We#re basically saying to their widow, widower or their children, do you know what, there#s  grand but you won#t get the pension rights that you would normally get in these circumstances.Now that#s not a kick in the teeth, that#s a terrible insult to the profession who stepped up in this circumstance. That#s really not acceptable, it#s penny-pinching from the Treasury in London, he said.In a further comment to the Belfast telegraph, Dr Black said: Scotland is offering standard death in service payments to those in that situation, but what is being proposed by Matt Hancock is a single one-off payment that would leave families without an ongoing pension. In the best case no-one would ever need to access this fund, but some doctors’ families might. In particular younger doctors who have not joined the pension scheme, those who have answer the call tofrom retirement to assist with the pandemic, locum doctors who do not have a fixed employer and those who may have opted out of the pension scheme. We know that our Minister is still weighing up how best to use this funding in Northern Ireland and we would strongly urge that it is a full death in service benefit not a single payment. Our frontline doctors and their families deserve nothing less.Speaking on Monday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: Nothing can make up for the tragic loss of a loved one during this pandemic. We owe a huge debt to those who die in service to our nation and are doing everything we can to protect them.“Financial worries should be the last thing on the minds of their families so in recognition of these unprecedented circumstances we are expanding financial protection to NHS and social care workers delivering publicly funded care on the frontline.“We will continue to strive night and day to provide them with the support and protection they need and deserve to keep them safe as they work tirelessly to save lives.”A Northern Ireland department of Health statement said the health minister was considering which model represents the best fit for Northern Ireland and which most equitably reflects the important contributions being made for our health service.Dferent approaches are being taken in dferent UK regions and the Minister will reach decision shortly, having examined the dferent options.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk bde .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dbaadd--e-d-dbcc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk bde .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dbaadd--e-d-dbcc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk bde .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dbaadd--e-d-dbcc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk bde .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dbaadd--e-d-dbcc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk bde .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dbaadd--e-d-dbcc_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"UKWhen will I be able to hug my close family, gran asks ministersA grandmother has askedhugging close family will be one of the first steps out of lockdown, in the first question from the public at the Downing Street coronavirus press conference. \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ecedcb-bbe--a-daa_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ecedcb-bbe--a-daa_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ecedcb-bbe--a-daa_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ecedcb-bbe--a-daa_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ecedcb-bbe--a-daa_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"CoronavirusNHS to restart vital services including cancer careThe NHS will restart some vital services, including cancer care, from today, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said, as he admitted the government has a lot of work to do to hit its , a day testing target. ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

First Minister Arlene Foster said the collective effort is ‘far from over’. Northern Ireland is still in a ‘critical moment’ during the first wave of the pandemic, she explained, and with one misstep the country faces the prospect of the virus reproduction rate going back above one – increasing the spread. She added: “Now is not the time for government and businesses to gamble with peoples’ lives, we need to proceed cautiously and ensure that we’re doing everything we can to prevent another spike from occurring.” googletag.cmd.push Governments around the world are ‘wrestling’ with the dilemma of ‘when is the right time to lt restrictions’, she said. The press conference heard that the decision to open cemeteries was criteria led and based on scientic advice. “The Executive will continue that on every decision we reach relating to COVID- but you also, the greater Northern Ireland community, have a role to play,” the DUP leader said. She acknowledged efforts made by the public through social distancing and isolation and recognised that people want to leave the confines of their homes. But added: “Now is not the time for impatience to get the better of us. No-one should act ascoronavirus has been beaten, it hasn’t, and we still have some way to go. googletag.cmd.push “If people go back to gathering in large numbers in public spaces andthey do not listen to the guidance on social distancing then they run the risk of another spike. “Having come so far in containing this disease it would be more than just a crying shame to undo that collective effort, it would be catastrophic for families, for communities and for a society as small as Northern Ireland’s.” The DUP leader referred to the speech made by Boris Johnson this morning when he said that thought must be given to ‘relaxation’, the path plotted carefully andthe government moves too fast it may be forced to ‘slam on the brakes’ again. Arlene Foster said: “That’s not what we want to do and we can’t afford to get too far ahead of ourselves.” She reiterated the point that the government would be led by scientic and medical advice and urged people to stay at home when possible. Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said it is ‘disappointing’ to hear reports that some people have decided to relax restrictions themselves. “That kind of attitude is wrong, it is reckless and it is endangering live. Until a vaccine is found it means that we must co-exist with this virus. “And that means a radical change to how we live our daily lives for some time. For the most part people have been making personal sacrices for that greater good. And thank you for that. “But we must keep going, we must save lives. There is light at the end of the tunnel, there certainly is light, but we need to keep doing what we’re doing now in order to save lives and help our healthcare staff cope in our healthcare system.” She praised the public and health workers and welcomed news of pound.m of additional support for care homes which will help with additional staff to care for those in isolation and enhanced cleaning. LOCKDOWN Restrictions will be reviewed up until May  but Arlene Foster again asked people to be patient. In terms of contact tracing, a pilot is starting here this week and an App is being developed. Meanwhile, Michelle O’Neill welcomed the British government stance, ‘albeit late’, of test, trace isolate - a policy endorsed by the World Health Organisation . “The countries which have been most effective are those that have moved on this very quickly. “Contact tracing needs to be rolled out right across the community because that is part of our success in being able to counter the position that we could find ourselves in later where,you’re facing a second wave of this, that our ability to stop that will come down to how effective we are in contact tracing,” Sinn Feacutein’s Vice President added. She encouraged people to ‘keep doing what we’re doing’ as it has ‘proven effective’. DEATH TOLL Michelle O’Neill gave a figure of  deaths -  announced in total by the Public Health Agencybased on figures provided by health trusts – but said NISRA statistics would bring it up to . When questioned about Sinn Feacutein leader Mary Lou McDonald’s comments that the pandemic is an ‘accelerant’ for a united Ireland, Ms O’Neill said an all-island approach to health ‘makes sense’ and is not a political point. “We live on an island and it’s a natural advantage so it’s important we use that.” While Ms Foster said her priority is saving lives and it’s ‘regrettable’ that other leaders are ‘naval gazing’ at this time. The southern government is planning to publish a report outlining a strategy for the easing of restrictions. When probed about Northern Ireland’s own lockdown exit strategy the First Minister did not indicatethat would happen in the North or indeed provide any timeframe. Michelle O’Neill added that talk of relaxation feeds into public discourse before reinforcing the government’s key message for people to stay at home.

In an ideal world, they would have received detailed scrutiny at the Assembly before becoming law. However, we are not living in an ideal world at present. The overriding priority at this time is protection of le. Regulations to enforce and encourage social distancing have a vital role to play in that regard. These regulations were introduced by the Department of Health, with support from all Executive Ministers. Responsibility for enforcing them rests with the Police. Regulations are never going to cover all potential aspects of human interaction and behaviour in a modern society. There will inevitably be some shades of grey. That’s the reality of le. The Police have rightly made clear that officers will apply a “reasonableness” test on occasions when decidingsome behaviours may breach the regulations. googletag.cmd.push The overriding principle in applying any reasonableness test is not what may be reasonable for people to want to do, but what is reasonable in achieving the aim of preventing the spread of the Covid- virus, balanced with other risks and considerations. Officers applying discretion are a regular feature of modern day policing. Discretion is by its nature case specic. Ultimately, any decisions can be challenged through the courts to determinethe “reasonableness” test has been correctly applied in all the circumstances. It should also be noted that people will routinely be given the option of complying with any requirement tohome without the need for any penalty to be imposed. Thankfully, the vast majority of people across our community are supportive and co-operative with these emergency measures. googletag.cmd.push Whilst understanding people’s desire for clarity in what constitutes an offence under the regulations, it is not always possible to give inidual answers for the countless hypothetical scenarios which may arise. Notwithstanding this, the public health guidance is clear: stay home and only leave home when it is essential. For our part, we are deeply concerned that the current discourse may serve to undermine public confidence in the overall regulations, and encourage some people to ignore the strong guidance from the NI Executive with potentially devastating consequences.

Adele Heaney has been working in the Covid- centre at the Mater Hospital in Belfast after being redeployed from the Royal Victoria Hospital to combat the outbreak. The Dungiven native recently featured in a BBC documentary called ‘First Time Doctors’ that revealed the realities of le as a recent graduate on a busy hospital ward. “The purpose of the show was to get an insight to what it’s like being a doctor for the first time and the trials and tribulations of le inside and outside of work,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “So many people just see the doctor and that side of things, so the show was quite nice as it showed a bit of le outside work. “Everyone has had that experience of being the ‘newbie’ in the job and having to learn how to do things in a fast-moving environment. “It was daunting having cameras following you around but the thing that we wanted to show was what it is like for us as doctors.” Coming the end of her second year as a doctor, Adele has found herself thrust onto the frontline of the worst pandemic since the  Spanish Flu which killed an estimated  million people. googletag.cmd.push Adele has pleaded with the public not to become complacent and praised the vocal support that has come from the #ClapForCarers campaign on Thursday nights. “The first week they did that I was very emotional, to be honest,” said Adele. “When you’re in the hospital and you’re doing a dficult job, having tough conversations and seeing people pass away, it’s nice to see people appreciate the sacrices you are making. “The public have been trying to do their best to go by what the guidelines have been telling us – social distancing and staying indoors. We have to keep going with what we’ve been told. “Everybody in the community has their part to play. Your part might just be staying in the house but that is so, so important to flatten the curve and for us to beat this together. “We’ve seen the news reports from Wuhan and Italy, and we’ve seen how devastating the disease can be, so it’s important that we protect ourselves to protect other people.” While tackling the pandemic represents a ‘steep learning curve’ Adele points out that all healthcare staff are coming from a similar position. She said: “Lots of my senior colleagues who have been in the profession for over  years have never experienced anything like this. “I don’t think there is anything in training that really can prepare you. We’ve had to adapt quite quickly to a new style of working. “Coming into work and wearing a mask all the time has been dficult, but we have some amazing senior colleagues who we’ve been able to learn from. “It’s been dficult whenever we’ve had to make phone calls to families about their relatives who are really unwell, you’re not able to have those face-to-face reactions like you normally would. “Learning on the job has been hard, but it’s very humbling to be part of that and to be there for their family members when they aren’t able to be.” Born and bred at the foot of Benbradagh, Adele has already set her sights on a speedywhen the coronavirus threat finally eases. “To be honest, the thing I’m looking forward to the most is being able to come back home to Dungiven and be able to see my family and my boyfriend again,” she said. “It is very dficult when you’re doing this when you are so far from home. We have this persona of doctor but when we come home from work, we like the same things as everyone . “People have made sacrices of moving out of their family homes and not seeing their children or husbands or wives, so people are looking forward to being reunited with their families. “That contact with people is probably the thing I’m looking forward to most, as I’m sure most people are.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Adele Heaney has been working in the Covid- centre at the Mater Hospital in Belfast after being redeployed from the Royal Victoria Hospital to combat the outbreak. The Dungiven native recently featured in a BBC documentary called ‘First Time Doctors’ that revealed the realities of le as a recent graduate on a busy hospital ward. “The purpose of the show was to get an insight to what it’s like being a doctor for the first time and the trials and tribulations of le inside and outside of work,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “So many people just see the doctor and that side of things, so the show was quite nice as it showed a bit of le outside work. “Everyone has had that experience of being the ‘newbie’ in the job and having to learn how to do things in a fast-moving environment. “It was daunting having cameras following you around but the thing that we wanted to show was what it is like for us as doctors.” Coming the end of her second year as a doctor, Adele has found herself thrust onto the frontline of the worst pandemic since the  Spanish Flu which killed an estimated  million people. googletag.cmd.push Adele has pleaded with the public not to become complacent and praised the vocal support that has come from the #ClapForCarers campaign on Thursday nights. “The first week they did that I was very emotional, to be honest,” said Adele. “When you’re in the hospital and you’re doing a dficult job, having tough conversations and seeing people pass away, it’s nice to see people appreciate the sacrices you are making. “The public have been trying to do their best to go by what the guidelines have been telling us – social distancing and staying indoors. We have to keep going with what we’ve been told. “Everybody in the community has their part to play. Your part might just be staying in the house but that is so, so important to flatten the curve and for us to beat this together. “We’ve seen the news reports from Wuhan and Italy, and we’ve seen how devastating the disease can be, so it’s important that we protect ourselves to protect other people.” While tackling the pandemic represents a ‘steep learning curve’ Adele points out that all healthcare staff are coming from a similar position. She said: “Lots of my senior colleagues who have been in the profession for over  years have never experienced anything like this. “I don’t think there is anything in training that really can prepare you. We’ve had to adapt quite quickly to a new style of working. “Coming into work and wearing a mask all the time has been dficult, but we have some amazing senior colleagues who we’ve been able to learn from. “It’s been dficult whenever we’ve had to make phone calls to families about their relatives who are really unwell, you’re not able to have those face-to-face reactions like you normally would. “Learning on the job has been hard, but it’s very humbling to be part of that and to be there for their family members when they aren’t able to be.” Born and bred at the foot of Benbradagh, Adele has already set her sights on a speedywhen the coronavirus threat finally eases. “To be honest, the thing I’m looking forward to the most is being able to come back home to Dungiven and be able to see my family and my boyfriend again,” she said. “It is very dficult when you’re doing this when you are so far from home. We have this persona of doctor but when we come home from work, we like the same things as everyone . “People have made sacrices of moving out of their family homes and not seeing their children or husbands or wives, so people are looking forward to being reunited with their families. “That contact with people is probably the thing I’m looking forward to most, as I’m sure most people are.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Claire McMullan of Dental  in Magherafelt is currently volunteering at one of five Emergency Dental Treatment Hubs across Northern Ireland. The hubs were set up when a shortage in PPE made it impossible to supply every dental practice with the necessary equipment to carry out procedures safely. She told the County Derry Post: “From mid-March, we began postponing non urgent appointments. “This was to ease the number of patients coming through the practice as social distancing measures were introduced. By the end of that week we were treating emergency cases only. googletag.cmd.push “As dentists, dental hygienists and dental nurses work in such close proximity to our patients while carrying out these procedures, we are at very high risk of personal exposure. “In order to protect our teams, patients and the wider community it is vital that we have the correct PPE and decontamination protocol to keep the risk to an absolute minimum. “At present there is a drastic shortage in the required PPE for Aerosol Generating Procedures .” Almost every procedure in dentistry creates an aerosol when the use of a drill, ultrasonic scaler, water or compressed air propels droplets of saliva into the air. googletag.cmd.push In order to prevent transmission of Covid- through these droplets, the Health and Social Care Board ceased all AGPs and all consultations are now carried out by telephone. “All patients requiring advice or emergency treatment are asked to phone the practice so the dentist can triage their call,” Claire explains. “If they require a simple dressing or extraction, we may be able to offer this in practicethe patient is not isolating, experiencing Covid- symptoms or been in contact with anyone experiencing symptoms.” “We will offer advice or prescription where possible. If the patient requires an AGP, for example, to begin root canal treatment, they will be referred to the Urgent Dental Centre . After an initial request for  volunteers, over  dentists came forward to staff the emergency hubs, but many are yet to reach operational capacity. This is due to the time it takes to process such a big number of volunteers and fit them with the appropriate PPE. Claire said: “Some volunteers are still waiting to be fitted for their FFP masks. Every dentist must be specially fitted for an FFP mask to safely carry out AGP. “Any patient who requires an emergency AGP is referred to the hub where dentists work in pairs wearing full PPE plastic gown, FFP mask, cap, full face visor, apron and gloves. “With the current lovely weather, working in all the PPE, in a surgery with no air conditioning or open windows has been a challenge!” Given the usual high standard of cross infection control in dentistry, there are concerns for practices when the Covid- pandemic eventually begins to recede. Ato normal within dentistry will require the correct standard of PPE, and Claire says there are concerns in sourcing and fitting the equipment, as well as how it will be funded. She said: “Our main concern is the urgent need for PPE so we can carry out normal dental treatment. “I think treatments will be reintroduced gradually to general dental practice. The Hubs will continue towhile the reintroduction is happening and there is a demand. “We will have to organise our diaries and treatments dferently to limit exposure, allow for more efficient use of PPE and leave time between appointments for settling and cleaning. “We are acutely aware of the effect Covid- limitations have on the population. Necessary treatment is being postponed and dental conditions are potentially worsening as a result. “It is vital that we get appropriate guidance, PPE and financial support to start caring for the population’s dental health as safely and quickly as possible.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

She said: “Our main concern is the urgent need for PPE so we can carry out normal dental treatment. “I think treatments will be reintroduced gradually to general dental practice. The Hubs will continue towhile the reintroduction is happening and there is a demand. “We will have to organise our diaries and treatments dferently to limit exposure, allow for more efficient use of PPE and leave time between appointments for settling and cleaning. “We are acutely aware of the effect Covid- limitations have on the population. Necessary treatment is being postponed and dental conditions are potentially worsening as a result. “It is vital that we get appropriate guidance, PPE and financial support to start caring for the population’s dental health as safely and quickly as possible.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The current coronavirus pandemic means that all schools across the city are currently closed but last year the Education Authorityproposed discontinuing Groarty Controlled Integrated Primary School.  The school has been a part of the local community for over  years. It attained Integrated status in  and is the only Integrated school on the West Bank of the city. A final decision regarding its closure was expected to be made by the department and new Education Minister Peter Weir at the beginning of this year. googletag.cmd.push Now, in a statement to the Derry News a spokesperson for the Department of Education said: “As a result of the COVID- emergency situation Area Planning activity has largely been paused, with available resources deployed in support of the Department’s emergency response to COVID-. “The school will be advised as soon as any decision has been made, however an exact timeframe for a decision cannot be given at this time.” The number of pupils at the school has fluctuated over time but has not risen above  in the past ten years. Ahead of the   school year - before proposals were announced to close -  pupils enrolled. googletag.cmd.push Following that decision numerous parents took the decision to transfer their children to other schools which was reflected in enrolment figures of just  for the   school year. One parent, Diana McLaughlin, previously told the Derry News that uncertainty surrounding the school’s future and looming transfer tests meant she had to take the ‘dficult decision’ to move her son and daughter where. The EA proposed closing Groarty Integrated Primary School, situated on the Coshquin Road, at the end of August . Parents were ‘devastated’ when first informed of the plans on April , . Schoolchildren from the school then hand delivered letters to then education chief, Derek Baker, when he visited Derry’s Guildhall imploring him to reconsider. The school has a capacity for  pupils and it was anticipated that by transforming from a controlled primary school to a controlled integrated primary school in  that numbers were going to swell. ‘DISAGREE’ A consultation received  objections from amongst others the Board of Governors, staff, parents, a local resident and the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education. Points include the fact it is the only integrated primary school in the cityside and considerable distance to the other one, Oakgrove IPS, in the waterside. It caters for children with special needs and has a strong shared educational programme with Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige. The case was also made that housing developments are planned for the area which could improve numbers. However, the EA says that other schools close to Groarty, such as Irish Medium School Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige and Catholic Maintained Schools St Eithne’s and Holy Family have many unfilled places. The EA argues that the school ‘does not operate within its in-year budget’, the school’s enrolment falls ‘well short’ of the Sustainable Schools Policy criteria for primary schools, set at  pupils for a rural school and  pupils for an urban school. And says in addition there are more than two year groups within a classroom as the school operates as a three teacher school. EA therefore recommends that Groarty Controlled Integrated Primary School discontinues with effect from  August .

The call for the loud voice from the city came from SDLP Foyle MLA Sinead McLaughlin. “I am angry and frustrated,” she said. “Our city has been waiting far too long for the expansion of Magee – half a century, in fact. But it has also been waiting an absurdly long time for the Medical School to get the go-ahead. And this remains the case, even though the SDLPs leader Colum Eastwood secured additional money from the UK government as part of the New Decade, New Approach agreement. googletag.cmd.push “It is time for the Department of Health, Department for the Economy and Department of Finance, and their ministers, to end this game of pass the parcel – or pass the blame – and make the decision to approve the Medical School and deliver it. The people of Derry have now run out of patience and we have all nearly run out of time to get this over the line. “It is obvious that we need the Medical School in Derry. We have a chronic shortage of doctors in the North West. The establishment of the Medical School will help to put that right. googletag.cmd.push “Many people owe their lives to the work of medical professionals over recent weeks. But the truth is that we need more of them. Let us treat the medical profession with respect, by recognising their work and the risks they have taken, by paying them properly, by providing sufficient personal protection equipment for their needs and by training enough doctors and other health professionals to do the job that we expect them to do. “So I say to the people of Derry, please come together and shout as loud as you can to tell the political leaders and senior civil servants of Northern Ireland that they must this time do the right thing and give the go-ahead for the Magee Medical School.” People of Derry and the rest of the north can respond to the call by sending emails to politicians, as well as sharing social media posts, using the hashtag #MedicalSchoolforDerry. Sinead McLaughlin is deputy chair of the Northern Ireland Assembly’s economy committee and intends to raise at today’s meeting of the committee the need for an urgent, positive, decision on the Medical School.

There was no substitute for the excitement. It lit a flame that still burns to this day. He squeezed every drop from a playing career that also saw him play three seasons in England and bank a letime of memories. His knees eventually told him enough was enough and when Crusaders changed their mind on an operation, it was time to take stock.“It was too much money and I was over . They were not going to take a chance and you couldnt really blame them,” Jim recalls.His football career was far from finished. Like when Stoke chose not to renew his contract, Jim McGroarty was at a footballing crossroads. But he was far from finished.He would later manage Limavady United. Before that, the Lettershandoney native steered Dungiven Celtic to nine trophies during the clubs golden era.When Patsy McGowan signed McGroarty, for Sligo Rovers on hisfrom Stoke, he would play in the League of Ireland on a Sunday, after managing Dungiven - where he now lived - on a Saturday.It was a hectic time. They trained on Tuesday and Thursday nights, opposite Sligos Wednesday and Friday schedule.He managed the Ballyguddin side for best part of  years. The only blip came during his time playing in the Irish League, when mixing both, under the same governing body, wasnt permitted and the Dungiven reins were passed on to Brian Ward.Ward was one of three Briansto score in the clubs - win over Derry City to land the NW Intermediate Cup in  – their first trophy in intermediate football. “The boys must have drank for a week,” McGroarty remembers. The club had made the ambitious move to elevate themselves to intermediate football in . McGroarty is very grateful to them for putting him through his coaching badges. He holds an A licence, achieved over a year with visits to assess his progress.During the s, Dungiven lost three Intermediate Cup finals, but enjoyed two runs in the Irish Cup that included a - defeat at Crusaders.As a player, McGroarty lost an Irish Cup final with Glenavon, to a late Glentoran penalty in  and was on the Sligo Rovers team that fell - to Dundalk in the  FAI Cup Final in front of , fans.He tapped into this experience during Dungivens cup runs.“If we had a home tie. I would get boys in at nine oclock on a Saturday morning and go through all the set pieces,” he outlines.The players would then have breakfast together, all paid from their own pocket, before relaxing and ing to Ballyguddin for the game later in the day, with everything fresh in their mind.“It worked,” McGroarty feels. “You were playing the top teams from the amateur league in Belfast or the intermediate leagues in Ballymena.“A lot of the games were tight, the score was - and one of the set pieces you worked on that morning...you could get it in the last five minutes and somebody stuck the ball in the back of the net. You are trying to add a bit of professionalism.”On away days, the Dungiven players were asked to wear a collar and tie. It was about turning up at senior clubs, well-dressed. It was a statement of intent. googletag.cmd.push *** When you quiz Jim McGroarty on the secret to Dungiven Celtics success at the start of the millennium, the word modesty perfectly describes the unspoken narrative coming down the line. He plays down his role in the success that was to follow. In addition, he is not one for name-checking. Hed have to mention about  men. There is a genuine respect he has for the collective force the players delivered. They are not just words. The tone in his voice reinforces pride this era brought him. He is a football man through and through,After knocking on the door, silverware was a regular visitor to Dungiven during the s. Four intermediate leagues and cups were won under his watch.The breakthrough came with the   league title. The following season, they secured the double in a year to remember that saw the reserves and thirds win their respective leagues. McGroarty also remembers the generation before.“There were a hell of a lot of players over the years, who were really good footballers. They never won a league and some of them didnt even win a trophy,” he said.It was followed by a core of young players, who fused into a winning formula as the attitude began to change.“First of all, they wanted to play football. Second of all, they wanted to do well and thirdly, they wanted to play for Dungiven Celtic. When you put that together, you dont have a lot to do as a manager or a coach.” googletag.cmd.push  Jim managed Dungiven to their first Intermediate League title in   Even snow wasnt an obstacle in preparations. On one occasion, two balls were sent to a shop up the town to get sprayed and ed Massey Ferguson red, McGroarty recalls.“It allowed us to train away in the snow, thats the sort of commitment we had. We had a good bunch of lads, it took a few years and we built the team up and, apart from a couple, the rest of the players were from around the town.”Another important ingredient in Jims cocktail for success was having players battling for places. With  to  players jockeying for  jerseys, the manager had the players in the palm of his hand.“If you have a boy who plays for you on a Saturday, without caring how he plays because he knows he will be on the following weekend – thats never going to work.”“Even Seamus Harkin - who is now Chairman - and the younger boys at the time. They didnt want to go and play for the reserves. They wanted to be on the bench for the seniors and get a few minutes. Thats the type of young boys you had at the time.”Getting into the first team was all that mattered. And McGroarty was beginning to get a kick out of management, as the trophies began to roll in.“You train hard on a Tuesday night, you set your stall out on a Thursday night how you are going to play on a Saturday andyou see it all coming together in front of you, thats what being a coach and manager is all about.”With nine trophies to his name, he jokes about ato the club. “Maybe, Ill take it into double figures,” he laughs.Jim McGroartys enthusiasm, even now, is infectious. *** Jim is the oldest of a family of four. Growing up, as a avid Manchester United supporter, he was infatuated with George Best. He donned the same boots and jersey, as he played around the fields of Slaughtmanus. “It couldve ended up -a-side,” McGroarty jokes. “If you werent quick or strong, you maybe touched the ball once. Parents were out at dark to get you into bed, for school the next morning.”He mixed soccer and Gaelic football for much of his career. One of the earliest memories was of winning a league, championship and nine carnival cups - all in one year - with the now defunct St Marys Mullaghbuoy.The newly formed St Marys Slaughtmanus won the  intermediate championship. Jim was on the team and managed them to the  final, a one-point defeat by Castledawson.He remembers coming on as a sub for Derry minors at Omagh in a - to - defeat to Armagh. McGroarty bagged - in a tempestuous encounter that saw him end up in hospital with a suspected broke nose. He wasnt on his own.“Harry Joe McWilliams was buried up against a post and Frankie Trainer had a broken nose, he was hit from behind.” Jim adds.When Derry won their second Ulster U title in , Jim was on the squad that included Joe Irwin, Gerry McElhinney, Colm McGuigan and Alfie Dallas.By then, his soccer career was beginning to develop.He first played competitively with Tamnaherin Youth Club in the Saturday morning league. At that time, he also played for Foyle Harps in the Summer Cups, which was growing in popularity with prizes up to pound, for the winning team.After impressing a - win over Buncrana in the final, at Maginn Park, he was spotted by Finn Harps and signed for the first of three times by Patsy McGowan.At the age of , Jims talents also attracted Glasgow Celtics scouts, but his -day trial was cut short by injury after a week.“I caught a boys studs and with a swollen foot, that was end of that trial. It was a great experience too...I played at Parkhead and at Ibrox.”At that time, the squad wouldve trained behind the goals at Parkhead.“There used to be a five-a-side,” McGroarty remembers. “Kenny Dalglish, Danny McGrain and Paul McStay were there. I got to play five-a-side with them, which was good.”By the time Stoke came calling, he was in a better place. The experience and lessons from Celtic were invaluable. He knew the level that was required. *** When McGroarty signed for Finn Harps, it was at the end of the  season. He got a handful of games, but he was stronger the following year and became a regular. At the end of the season, he played in an exhibition game for the Harps against an invitational select.”“I couldnt believe it...I was on the same pitch as Frank Stapleton, Liam Brady and Johnny Giles. I was nearly a full international team, but I didnt know that Stoke City were at the game and they asked me over for the trial.” This time he impressed and signed a one-year deal in October . Going over to unknown territory didnt come into the decision-making process. Jims decision was easy.“I wouldve swam over and I wouldve played for nothing. I always wanted to be a footballer.” McGroarty said, with an enthusiasm that hasnt dwindled over the years.“George Eastham was the Stoke manager and he scored the winner in the  League Cup final - over Cha...a lovely man.”McGroarty made his first team debut away to Oldham. At the team meeting in the hotel before the game, Eastham gave their new signing the responsibility to marshal the defence on any Oldham free kicks outside the box.“Can you line the wall ” the manager asked.“I can boss, I used to be a bricklayer,” was Jims instinctive answer, and he remembers the rest of the team killing themselves in laughter.When McGroarty later went to apologise, Eastham was having none of it.“You dont need to apologise. I like boys with a bit of character,” he said.Playing professional football was a dream, but a step up in class.“When you go to training every day, you cant be taking your foot off the pedal or looking over your shoulder,” Jim explains.“You have to knuckle down, the boy beside you is looking for your jersey and up the line, you are looking for somebodys jersey.”During McGroartys time at Stoke, there was a change of manager, as Eastham was replaced by Alan Durban. He brought Howard Kendall in as player coach.“Kendall was the best player I played alongside,” states McGroarty, of the man who would lead Everton to First Division , FA Cup and European Cup Winners Cup honoursJims contract was renewed every season for three years, before he was given the bad news that his time at the club was over.“When the last contract was up, they didnt resign me. There was not a lot of security in it. It is a rat race, you have to accept it and not rest on your laurels - you have to get on with it,” he said.“I wasnt back in Ireland two days until Patsywas on the phone and signed me at Sligo Rovers and I would then move back to Ballybofey when he later joined Finn Harps.”By the mid-s, Derry City moved from the Irish League to join the League of Ireland. The Candystripes expressed an interest in snapping up McGroarty, be he declined.“I didnt go back to the League of Ireland. I was scundered with the travelling. Youd have to go Derry for training and even when I was with Finn Harps, it was like an away game.“If you went to Waterford or Cork, it was an overnight stay in those days, but you had  players packed into a -seater minibus. If you were lucky, you got a seat andnot, you are lying on top of the kit-bags.”It was time for a change. His three years at Glenavon saw him come close to winning a cup, but they lostto Glentoran. Defender Andy Russell clawed a ball off the line with his hand and Jim Cleary dispatched his spot-kick to the top corner of the net.“I missed a sitter in that game,” McGroarty recalls. After Glenavon, he moved to Crusaders for the final leg of his career. Eventually, the knocks caught up with him and injury forced his hand.It was time to plough all his energy into Dungiven Celtic. Once a competitor, always a competitor. And the players bought into his philosophy of management. His experience, coupled with his desire for success, was the catalyst for what was to follow. With nine titles to his name in his time as manager with Dungiven Celtic, would heto make it the perfect  “Never say never,” he concluded.

There was no substitute for the excitement. It lit a flame that still burns to this day. He squeezed every drop from a playing career that also saw him play three seasons in England and bank a letime of memories. His knees eventually told him enough was enough and when Crusaders changed their mind on an operation, it was time to take stock.“It was too much money and I was over . They were not going to take a chance and you couldnt really blame them,” Jim recalls.His football career was far from finished. Like when Stoke chose not to renew his contract, Jim McGroarty was at a footballing crossroads. But he was far from finished.He would later manage Limavady United. Before that, the Lettershandoney native steered Dungiven Celtic to nine trophies during the clubs golden era.When Patsy McGowan signed McGroarty, for Sligo Rovers on hisfrom Stoke, he would play in the League of Ireland on a Sunday, after managing Dungiven - where he now lived - on a Saturday.It was a hectic time. They trained on Tuesday and Thursday nights, opposite Sligos Wednesday and Friday schedule.He managed the Ballyguddin side for best part of  years. The only blip came during his time playing in the Irish League, when mixing both, under the same governing body, wasnt permitted and the Dungiven reins were passed on to Brian Ward.Ward was one of three Briansto score in the clubs - win over Derry City to land the NW Intermediate Cup in  – their first trophy in intermediate football. “The boys must have drank for a week,” McGroarty remembers. The club had made the ambitious move to elevate themselves to intermediate football in . McGroarty is very grateful to them for putting him through his coaching badges. He holds an A licence, achieved over a year with visits to assess his progress.During the s, Dungiven lost three Intermediate Cup finals, but enjoyed two runs in the Irish Cup that included a - defeat at Crusaders.As a player, McGroarty lost an Irish Cup final with Glenavon, to a late Glentoran penalty in  and was on the Sligo Rovers team that fell - to Dundalk in the  FAI Cup Final in front of , fans.He tapped into this experience during Dungivens cup runs.“If we had a home tie. I would get boys in at nine oclock on a Saturday morning and go through all the set pieces,” he outlines.The players would then have breakfast together, all paid from their own pocket, before relaxing and ing to Ballyguddin for the game later in the day, with everything fresh in their mind.“It worked,” McGroarty feels. “You were playing the top teams from the amateur league in Belfast or the intermediate leagues in Ballymena.“A lot of the games were tight, the score was - and one of the set pieces you worked on that morning...you could get it in the last five minutes and somebody stuck the ball in the back of the net. You are trying to add a bit of professionalism.”On away days, the Dungiven players were asked to wear a collar and tie. It was about turning up at senior clubs, well-dressed. It was a statement of intent. googletag.cmd.push *** When you quiz Jim McGroarty on the secret to Dungiven Celtics success at the start of the millennium, the word modesty perfectly describes the unspoken narrative coming down the line. He plays down his role in the success that was to follow. In addition, he is not one for name-checking. Hed have to mention about  men. There is a genuine respect he has for the collective force the players delivered. They are not just words. The tone in his voice reinforces pride this era brought him. He is a football man through and through,After knocking on the door, silverware was a regular visitor to Dungiven during the s. Four intermediate leagues and cups were won under his watch.The breakthrough came with the   league title. The following season, they secured the double in a year to remember that saw the reserves and thirds win their respective leagues. McGroarty also remembers the generation before.“There were a hell of a lot of players over the years, who were really good footballers. They never won a league and some of them didnt even win a trophy,” he said.It was followed by a core of young players, who fused into a winning formula as the attitude began to change.“First of all, they wanted to play football. Second of all, they wanted to do well and thirdly, they wanted to play for Dungiven Celtic. When you put that together, you dont have a lot to do as a manager or a coach.” googletag.cmd.push  Jim managed Dungiven to their first Intermediate League title in   Even snow wasnt an obstacle in preparations. On one occasion, two balls were sent to a shop up the town to get sprayed and ed Massey Ferguson red, McGroarty recalls.“It allowed us to train away in the snow, thats the sort of commitment we had. We had a good bunch of lads, it took a few years and we built the team up and, apart from a couple, the rest of the players were from around the town.”Another important ingredient in Jims cocktail for success was having players battling for places. With  to  players jockeying for  jerseys, the manager had the players in the palm of his hand.“If you have a boy who plays for you on a Saturday, without caring how he plays because he knows he will be on the following weekend – thats never going to work.”“Even Seamus Harkin - who is now Chairman - and the younger boys at the time. They didnt want to go and play for the reserves. They wanted to be on the bench for the seniors and get a few minutes. Thats the type of young boys you had at the time.”Getting into the first team was all that mattered. And McGroarty was beginning to get a kick out of management, as the trophies began to roll in.“You train hard on a Tuesday night, you set your stall out on a Thursday night how you are going to play on a Saturday andyou see it all coming together in front of you, thats what being a coach and manager is all about.”With nine trophies to his name, he jokes about ato the club. “Maybe, Ill take it into double figures,” he laughs.Jim McGroartys enthusiasm, even now, is infectious. *** Jim is the oldest of a family of four. Growing up, as a avid Manchester United supporter, he was infatuated with George Best. He donned the same boots and jersey, as he played around the fields of Slaughtmanus. “It couldve ended up -a-side,” McGroarty jokes. “If you werent quick or strong, you maybe touched the ball once. Parents were out at dark to get you into bed, for school the next morning.”He mixed soccer and Gaelic football for much of his career. One of the earliest memories was of winning a league, championship and nine carnival cups - all in one year - with the now defunct St Marys Mullaghbuoy.The newly formed St Marys Slaughtmanus won the  intermediate championship. Jim was on the team and managed them to the  final, a one-point defeat by Castledawson.He remembers coming on as a sub for Derry minors at Omagh in a - to - defeat to Armagh. McGroarty bagged - in a tempestuous encounter that saw him end up in hospital with a suspected broke nose. He wasnt on his own.“Harry Joe McWilliams was buried up against a post and Frankie Trainer had a broken nose, he was hit from behind.” Jim adds.When Derry won their second Ulster U title in , Jim was on the squad that included Joe Irwin, Gerry McElhinney, Colm McGuigan and Alfie Dallas.By then, his soccer career was beginning to develop.He first played competitively with Tamnaherin Youth Club in the Saturday morning league. At that time, he also played for Foyle Harps in the Summer Cups, which was growing in popularity with prizes up to pound, for the winning team.After impressing a - win over Buncrana in the final, at Maginn Park, he was spotted by Finn Harps and signed for the first of three times by Patsy McGowan.At the age of , Jims talents also attracted Glasgow Celtics scouts, but his -day trial was cut short by injury after a week.“I caught a boys studs and with a swollen foot, that was end of that trial. It was a great experience too...I played at Parkhead and at Ibrox.”At that time, the squad wouldve trained behind the goals at Parkhead.“There used to be a five-a-side,” McGroarty remembers. “Kenny Dalglish, Danny McGrain and Paul McStay were there. I got to play five-a-side with them, which was good.”By the time Stoke came calling, he was in a better place. The experience and lessons from Celtic were invaluable. He knew the level that was required. *** When McGroarty signed for Finn Harps, it was at the end of the  season. He got a handful of games, but he was stronger the following year and became a regular. At the end of the season, he played in an exhibition game for the Harps against an invitational select.”“I couldnt believe it...I was on the same pitch as Frank Stapleton, Liam Brady and Johnny Giles. I was nearly a full international team, but I didnt know that Stoke City were at the game and they asked me over for the trial.” This time he impressed and signed a one-year deal in October . Going over to unknown territory didnt come into the decision-making process. Jims decision was easy.“I wouldve swam over and I wouldve played for nothing. I always wanted to be a footballer.” McGroarty said, with an enthusiasm that hasnt dwindled over the years.“George Eastham was the Stoke manager and he scored the winner in the  League Cup final - over Cha...a lovely man.”McGroarty made his first team debut away to Oldham. At the team meeting in the hotel before the game, Eastham gave their new signing the responsibility to marshal the defence on any Oldham free kicks outside the box.“Can you line the wall ” the manager asked.“I can boss, I used to be a bricklayer,” was Jims instinctive answer, and he remembers the rest of the team killing themselves in laughter.When McGroarty later went to apologise, Eastham was having none of it.“You dont need to apologise. I like boys with a bit of character,” he said.Playing professional football was a dream, but a step up in class.“When you go to training every day, you cant be taking your foot off the pedal or looking over your shoulder,” Jim explains.“You have to knuckle down, the boy beside you is looking for your jersey and up the line, you are looking for somebodys jersey.”During McGroartys time at Stoke, there was a change of manager, as Eastham was replaced by Alan Durban. He brought Howard Kendall in as player coach.“Kendall was the best player I played alongside,” states McGroarty, of the man who would lead Everton to First Division , FA Cup and European Cup Winners Cup honoursJims contract was renewed every season for three years, before he was given the bad news that his time at the club was over.“When the last contract was up, they didnt resign me. There was not a lot of security in it. It is a rat race, you have to accept it and not rest on your laurels - you have to get on with it,” he said.“I wasnt back in Ireland two days until Patsywas on the phone and signed me at Sligo Rovers and I would then move back to Ballybofey when he later joined Finn Harps.”By the mid-s, Derry City moved from the Irish League to join the League of Ireland. The Candystripes expressed an interest in snapping up McGroarty, be he declined.“I didnt go back to the League of Ireland. I was scundered with the travelling. Youd have to go Derry for training and even when I was with Finn Harps, it was like an away game.“If you went to Waterford or Cork, it was an overnight stay in those days, but you had  players packed into a -seater minibus. If you were lucky, you got a seat andnot, you are lying on top of the kit-bags.”It was time for a change. His three years at Glenavon saw him come close to winning a cup, but they lostto Glentoran. Defender Andy Russell clawed a ball off the line with his hand and Jim Cleary dispatched his spot-kick to the top corner of the net.“I missed a sitter in that game,” McGroarty recalls. After Glenavon, he moved to Crusaders for the final leg of his career. Eventually, the knocks caught up with him and injury forced his hand.It was time to plough all his energy into Dungiven Celtic. Once a competitor, always a competitor. And the players bought into his philosophy of management. His experience, coupled with his desire for success, was the catalyst for what was to follow. With nine titles to his name in his time as manager with Dungiven Celtic, would heto make it the perfect  “Never say never,” he concluded.

He was impressionable. In September, he was listening intently to the wireless, as Derry launched their first bid for Sam Maguire. He wasnt just reliant on the radio waves to savour the magic. Twice a week, the Derry team would train in nearby Newbridge and he got to meet his heroes. Where the towns Credit Union now resides, John Joe Diamonds cafe was located on Bellaghys Castle Street. Tommy, now  years of age, vividly remembers the scene as his mother Cathy made plates of sandwiches for the players before they ed home, to the four corners of the county. googletag.cmd.push “When you get the county stars in your kitchen twice a week, I got to know them all well and I was friendly with them through the years,” Diamond begins. Sean OConnell would later train the Derry teams that Diamond would captain to All-Ireland glory. “I played with him too, hiscareer lasted a brave while...he mustve been  when he was still playing with Derry,” Diamond adds. When Bellaghy All-Ireland winning manager Harry Cassidy took charge at county level, he called Diamond into the senior  in the early s. He was part of the team that toured New York and Connecticut. googletag.cmd.push “We went out to play exhibition matches out there. It was an experience to get out there. We also won the Wembley Tournament two years in a row.” The semi-finals were played in the iconic stadium, with the final played out in New Eltham. “I was taking a look the other day and I think I have played in every county in Ireland,” Diamond added, of a county career that ended in . But it was the s, when he left his greatest imprint. *** In , Tommy was on Bellaghys first county U championship winning team and was a minor champion three years later. At county level, Derry minors had yet to reach an Ulster final. The first of Diamonds three years in the county minor team began in the closing stages of a game in Dungiven, with Antrim in the lead. “I remember being threw on as a late sub and two balls were kicked right over the full-back,” he recalls. “They landed in my hands and all I had to do was to kick them into the net and I think we won by a point.” After another season of consolidation, a place in the final again eluded them, but there was a crux of a team still eligible for . “We knew from , we had a good  and we didnt lose many,” said Diamond, who was made captain. When Derry defeated Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh on their way to the  minor league final, they did so without the St Columbs Derry players who focussed on winning the MacRory and Hogan Cups, under the management of former Fermanagh player Fr Ignatius McQuillan, just four years after tiptoeing onto the Ulster Colleges scene. “Then seven or eight of them came onto the Derryteam – which was some help,” Diamond added. “FrShields was the man who put the backbone into us and Sean , he put all the final touches to us, he was a great trainer.  Sean OConnell, Tommy Diamond and Fr Seamus Shields with the Tom Markham Cup “We trained twice a week up in Ballinascreen and after training we went into Timoneys for sandwiches and milk every night.” Aside from the medals and success, Diamond is grateful for the memories and friendships built up, that stood the test of time. “If any of us ever meet each other, it is a half day session. Thats the great thing about it.” They hammered Donegal in the  first round, in Dungiven, but the win came at a cost with a knee injury to Chris Brown. In the semi-final it was a dferent story and it was a narrow - to - win over Down, a game that saw Phil Friel sustain three fractured ribs. “We beat Cavan in the final in Clones,” Diamond remembers. “It was a hard, dour match and a typical Cavan match with hard hitting and not a lot of finesse about it.” Derry were Ulster champions and with the Hogan Cup now in the county, there was an air of quiet confidence as the squad headed to Croke Park. Diamonds first memory of their epic semi-final with Roscommon was giving the referee his name. “I was marking Dermot Early that day and we got booked after  seconds,” he laughs. “It was some start to a semi-final. I caught the ball and as soon as I caught the ball, he hit me. He was about two seconds late, I hit him with an upper cut and put him on the broad of his back and both of us were booked.” Derry were - to - winners and with the game in the melting pot in the second half, Early pulled a penalty wide of the posts when the Rossies were four points in arrears. “The great Miacutecheaacutel Oacute Muircheartaigh was commenting and he called it the game of the golden goals. Every one of them was hit in from  yards, absolute screamers.” It was time for one last push. Derry had one hand on the Tom Markham Cup. So too had Kerry. *** The Kingdom had the breeze and thanks to some wastefulness in Derrys attack, Kerry were a point ahead at the break. Sean OConnells pep talk worked wonders and the cogs began to turn. Tommy Diamond and Seamus Lagans performance at midfield helped them to a - to - win. “I dont remember an awful about it.” Diamond says. Earlier in the day, GAA President Alf Murray asked himhad his speech prepared with the customary lines of Irish, should Derry win. “I had no Irish, so he penned out the speech with the phonetics and I tucked it into the pocket of my shorts”. The speech mustve slipped out during the game and as he stood on the presentation podium, Diamonds pocket was empty. “I am the first man to just speak in English, I dont think it went down to well but I just had to go ahead with it,” he continued. The team stayed out in Portmarnock on the Saturday and Sunday night. Just recently Donal Mullan, son of county official at the time Paddy, handed Diamond a ticket from the post-final banquet. “The entrance admission was just  shillings,” he added. The homecoming on the Monday took nearly six hours, with crowds coming out along the route to salute the new champions. There were bonfires as the team crossed the county border. On the final leg of the journey, the victory cavalcade of cars coming to Maghera streamed all the way back to Tobermore. The Brackaghreilly Pipe band led John Mulhollands decorated lorry up Maghera street. “I remember being up on the top of the cab. They had a seat and I was tied into it and held the cup,” Diamond proudly beams. “It was some occasion for the firstchampionship to come into Derry.” Two years later, with Diamond still as captain, Derry won the Ulster U title before getting trounced by Mayo in the All-Ireland semi-final in Charlestown. “We were favourites for Ulster but we just werent ready for it ,” Diamond admits. “We were a year young and the next year we were all U and Sean OConnell was still in charge of us.” In , Derry swept all before them in Ulster, with only Down putting up any sort of resistance and Seamus McCloskeys - tally was enough to see off Monaghan in the final. Kerry came to Ballinascreen for the semi-final and trailed - to - at half-time, but had pegged the team back to a point midway through the second half. Diamond was switched to mark Brendan Lynch and a Kevin Teague goal helped swing the game in the home sides favour. Holders Mayo were shocked by Offaly in the other semi-final, setting up a Croke Park meeting with Derry. The Oaks led by nine points at the interval with the Faithful County down to -men after the dismissal of Eugene Mulligan, before easing to victory. He was the first player to captain his county to minor and U All-Ireland titles. But for Diamond,  was far from over. Despite playing three years for Derry minors, it took Diamond time to break into the Bellaghy senior team who would win seven titles during the s. He was dismissed, along with his brother Laurence, in the  semi-final win over Kilrea and missed the final. “Bellaghy had a strong  of players,” Diamond points out. “I only got my place on the senior team when Anthony Madden went to Australia and I got his place at right corner back.” There was nothing  only football and it is still the case. Karls son James is the first of his grandsons to play senior championship for the blues. The recent underage production line represents the hope in the new batch in the club. “They have the greatest facilities and have everything you would want and we have no team,” Diamond adds, referring to the -year gap since the John McLaughlin Cup rested in Bellaghy. “At that timewe had no facilities but we had teams....its a change of circumstances.” He picked up the third of eight senior medals in , but the Bellaghy adventure was only beginning. Once again, Diamond was involved in a first as the club were crowned Ulster champions in the first year of the competition. Frankie OLoane scored - in a  point win over Pearses of Belfast in the first round and it was followed up by a victory over a Newry Mitchells side that hammered Bryansford in the Down decider, thanks to goals from Sean Lee and Tom Scullion. Bellaghy beat St Josephs in the final, a combination of Ballyshannon and Bundoran, played on December  in the falling snow. “They had Brian McEnf and about  county men in total. They had a strong side and they actually, by right, shouldve beat us, but we were that dogged that day,” Diamond states. “It was a really cold day and we got a bit of a lead up against them. It was a rearguard action against the breeze in the second half but we held out.” There was no All-Ireland series until  when East Kerry won the title. Bellaghy retained their Derry title with a win over Slaughtneil in  before losing the final the following year to Newbridge. When they bounced back, it took them to their finest hour. A - to - win over Lavey saw them win Derry title number . In Ulster, they defeated Ballybofey, Ardboe and Teemore before taking on Armaghs Clann na nGael in the Ulster final. A - to - interval lead put them on their way to a facile win. In the All-Ireland series, it was a dferent story and Frankie OLoane was twice their savour. Tommy Diamond, Hugh McGoldrick and Chris Brown led from the half-back line against Portlaoise, but it was OLoane who tied the game late on, before Hugh Donnelly scored the winner in a - to - win. In the final, they took on the might of UCC and once again it took OLoane, with his seventh point of the game, to level matters late on. When Hugh McGoldrick broke up a Cork attack, Brendan Cassidy went on to score and the Tones were crowned All-Ireland champions. “Theyhad  county players, they were from all around. Moss Keane was full-back, he was a big tower of a man but Tom Quinn was too much for him.”   All-Ireland club - Tommy is on the extreme left of the front row Later that night, Cassidys lorry ferried the team up and down Bellaghy street to a heros welcome. Absent was the cup, as East Kerry didntit. “It is the sort of thing they cant take away from you,” Diamond said, of achieving the pinnacle of club football. He would later turn to management and managed Derry for  months at the end of the s, but stepped down after he felt the County Board were not allowing him full control of the team. Before that, at the start of the  season, Bellaghy were unable to get a senior manager, so Diamond put his name forward. The Tones went seven seasons without a title and werent tipped for glory. “Nobody wanted to take it. A lot of these managers, unless theyare good they are not interested at all,” he said. After winning the Derry title, Diamond took his side to Crossmaglen for the opening game of Ulster. After a battle, Bellaghy came out on top, but lost in the next round by a point at home to Castleblayney. “We shot in and shot inand Blayney went on to beat Burren in the Ulster final. I went to it in Dungannon, it was a dour match, - to -,” Diamond recalls, as Burrens quest for four-in-a-row failed. ”I said I would take themas far as I can, there wasnt much hope for them. We got them going rightly and I was disappointed we didnt win an All-Ireland with that team. I felt they were good enough.” *** Another passion is golf. He has been member of Ballymena Golf Club for  years, where he still plays with lelong friend Gerry McCann. He has been a member of Moyola, where he is now the Ranger.  Tommy andSeve Ballesteros Another friend of Diamond, Willie Cassidy, pulled off a coup in  by bringing Seve Ballesteros to play a round at the course, just months after he won the Masters. “I think it cost pound, to bring him to Moyola, he was number one in the world and Willie got him,” Diamond adds. “It is the only course in the north of Ireland I think he played on and I had the honour of caddying for him, I was the lowest handicapper at the club. “I marked his card, he countersigned it and it is up in the clubhouse for ever more amen.” A letime of memories. Aside from the current lock-down, the chat continues every Thursday night over the winter. Tommy plays cards with friends and his sons. It is a ritual. The social hub and the legacy of parents John Joe and Cathys cafe continues. RELATED - Derrys path to their first taste of September. Click here...

They cant get enough credit. The leadership didnt faff about once Leo Varadkar signalled the need for a lock-down earlier this month. On a local level, clubs have rallied around their communities and provided direction on so many fronts. Last week they delivered the archive of All-Ireland finals to the world. What a brilliant gesture, following on from the terric coverage given by broadcaster TG. Struggling with the withdrawal from sport, for those who are fanatical about it, cannot be underestimated. Last week, it was great to take a look back at Derrys only All-Ireland title. Highlights aside, I havent watched the final - in full - since I was at school. googletag.cmd.push WATCH - All-Ireland final  Hammering Down in the first round was a statement of intent. A mauling that led Pete McGrath to admit, in the post-game interview, that Mourne fans deserved an apology. The gesture didnt sit well with the Down players. Monaghans Gerry Mone gave Derry a torrid time in the Ulster semi-final at Casement before Joe Brolly came from the bench to give the spark needed for victory. The Ulster final saw Damian Cassidy gracefully skating over the puddles in Clones, in a game the Derry players were going to win, come hell or high water. It took a late block by Tony Scullion on Manus Boyle and Brian McGilligans intervention to deny Donegal another goal chance, when they had crafted a two on one situation. googletag.cmd.push In the All-Ireland semi-final, it wasnt until Johnny McGurks wonder pressure point that Derry would eventually rest easy against the Dubs in the season-defining clash. Anthony Tohills outstretched arms of celebration before Joxers kick went over the bar will always stick in my mind. The branch of the Derry Supporters Shop at the top of Hall Street in Maghera was thronged with people in the lead-up to the final. There was so much expectation that Sam wouldon the Monday evening. In a powerful video interview with Shane Stapleton on #OurGame, Tony Scullion touched on how he felt the wave of emotion was almost congratulating them as they departed for the final. It was a Cork team that hammered a poor Mayo outfit in the semi-final, I thought. With hindsight and on watching the final, from someone outside the camp, the mental strength was Derrys greatest asset that day. Cork had nine players who had played in an All-Ireland senior final. They had played in five, winning two and losing twice, once after a replay. Derry, while being the upcoming team and having dispatched the  and  champions on their way, they were untested on the biggest day of the season. HAMMER BLOW From my position on the Hill that day, I can still see Joe Kavanaghs number  jersey cutting through the Derry defence before hammering past the advancing Damien McCusker. It was the first goal Derry had conceded since June , that sunny day in Castleblayney when Derry fans applauded Monaghan scoring their only point of the first half. In the second half, three Farney goals had Oakleafers shaking, before getting out with a draw. Kavanaghs goal brought me back to that day. Derry never do anything the easy way. Colin Corkery won the first two balls off Gary Coleman, John ODriscoll beat Tony Scullion to an early possession. Corks running game had Derry in all sorts of trouble. Fergal P McCusker and Henry Downey couldnt get to grips with Don Davis and Joe Kavanagh respectively. When Derry eventually went on an attack, Mark OConnor won the first battle with Seamus Downey. Derry were - to - in arrears. Was Derry going to fail the final hurdle again  Brian McGilligan then won a vital possession at midfield. It was small, yet massive. Later in the attack Damian Bartons trademark disguised hand pass - where he looked one way and gave the ball the other - found Johnny McGurk who fired over Derrys first point of the game. It took a series of Cork mistakes to swing the momentum. Teddy McCarthy dropped a routine pass from Niall Cahalane and McGilligan curled between the posts. The now dominant Tohill hoovered up a loose Teddy McCarthy pass before going on a storming run to win a free and Gormley slotted over. The Oaks were now only two points in arrears and growing in confidence. McGilligan turned the screw even tighter. John Kerins had been targetting Barry Coffeys height advantage over Johnny McGurk on his kick-outs. Across came McGilligan to win a ball he had no right to. It was inspirational. The big man launched a pass forward that eventually found Damian Cassidy. Cass swung a ball into the square. Seamus Downey made up the guts of  metres to take advantage of a mix-up between Kerins and OConnor, before punching to the net. Boom. Derry were on top. Heaney nearly beat Kerins to the ball for a further goal chance and, earlier, the Cork stopper made a brilliant save to deny Cassidy. Then referee Tommy Howard made two wrong calls. Cahalane buried Enda Gormley off the ball and got off with just a lecture. Seconds later, Tony Davis was harshly sent off for a lazy lunge at Dermot Heaney, with Howard gesturing the use of an elbow. It was the wrong call. The narrative was always that the punch woke Enda up. Thats harsh I feel. There was very little ball directed into his corner before that. Everything went thought Brolly. However, it lit a fire and Gormley went on to score six points. Derry twice led by three points and when Dermot McNicholl curled over, after the interval, it shouldve been the catalyst to push on. Brolly was toasting Brian Corcoran and shouldve been used more. John ODriscoll started the second half at wing forward, with Colin Corkery in on Tony Scullion. But when Don Davis inch-perfect pass took out the entire Derry defence, ODriscoll drilled to the net and Cork were ahead. Thats where the Derry resolve was again tested. And they passed. There was no sign of panic. McGurk was allocated the extra-man role. Fergal P McCusker, Henry Downey - and later McKeever – ran the show in defence. With the extra man, Damien McCuskers outfield experience saw him use short kick-outs before they were even invented. For all their control, they failed to ask any questions of Derrys defence, but when Gormley levelled the game, the Ulster champions superior fitness carried them into the three point lead. Even then, Derry did it the hard way. With Steven OBrien now at full-forward, Cork began to throw the dice for the last time. If every the term getting over the line was used, then this was all so relevant. Derry had performed better on other days during the Eamonn Coleman era, but winning was the only thing. Failure wasnt an option and they refused to be denied their moment of glory. It was richly deserved. Its just a pity there was no back door and that Eamonn was controversially sacked. This group had so much more to offer. RELATED - Sideline View wants Derry to fast forward.Click here...

The smiling photograph of the little girl in a First Communion dress was taken by former Derry Journal photographerLarry Doherty in the s. It lay uncollected in a box for many years until Larrys daughter, Moira Doherty, discovered it recently and posted it on Facebook in the hope of reuniting it with its owner. Tracy Morroi, who is a teacher at St Patricks Primary School in Pennyburn, was contacted by a friend who noticed the striking resemblance to her, but at first she thought it was just a coincidence. googletag.cmd.push I said Im not old enough to be in a black and white photograph, said Mrs Morroi. As time went on more and more people contacted her who suggested it was her mum, Maura Wade nee Doherty, who passed away almost seven years ago. At first Mrs Morroiwas unsureit wasdefinitely her, and she didnt want to collect the picture in case it belonged to another family. However, she was inundated with calls and messages from people who remembered her mother as a young girl and confirmed it was indeed her in the picture. Maura Dohertywas born in  the front room of her grandparentshome in  Bishops Street, which is now the Oakgrove Bar. googletag.cmd.push Her parents Maureen and George Doherty then moved to  Long Tower STreet where she grew up and attended the Wee Nuns school. My mammy worked in all the factories so everybody knew her, explained Mrs Morroi. She was a really bubbly person and would have chatted to anyone. Its been really nice to hear from people who remember her. I picked up the picture and it really made day. It was so emotional. Its so special to get it because I only have two other pictures of my mother as a child.  Mrs Morroisaid the whole experience has been very emotional. I had been doing a redding out the house this week and I had come across a lot of my mothers things so I was just having wavesof emotion anyway and this happened. Ive just been crying my eyes out.

The Mayor is asking local children to send her either a picture, which can be accompanied by a short story, or alternatively to write a poem that focuses on the positive things that they have enjoyed despite this uncertain time. The competition will be broken up into two age groups – primary one to primary three children, aged - years old, and primary four to primary seven children, aged -. googletag.cmd.push Entries are open from todayand will close in two weeks time when the Mayor will select a winner and a runner up for each category from each age group and they will receive a goody bag of prizes. Mayor Boyle said that she wanted to give young people within the District a way of expressing their feelings creatively, while also praising them for how well they have handled the current situation. I have been so impressed with how well the children of our District have done in dealing with this strange time we are in. I know so many of them would love to be out playing in the sunshine with their friends, but they have been so good in following all of the rules and in listening to their parents and s to keep themselves, and all of us, safe. I think they should all be really proud of themselves. googletag.cmd.push Although Im sure there were a few excited faces about getting out of school, its still important to do some fun learning activities at home. This initiative is a great way to do that while also getting to draw and write down how you feel and the parts that you have enjoyed about the last few months, like spending lots of time with your family. I am so excited to read and see all the pictures, stories and poems. I already know it will be impossible to pick a winner because we have so many talented boys and girls! Entries can be submitted by emailing mayor@derrystrabane. Please include your contact details and the name and age of the child. The deadline for entries is Tuesday, May .

The Cornerstone City Church is based in the Duke Street building that was previously home to the Red Rooms nightclub. It also houses the churchs Hope Centre which offers food and clothing banks, counsellors and money management help and advice. The Hope Centre has been forced to close due to the coronavirus, but the drive-through food bank service allows them to continue their charitable work whilst observing social distancing. googletag.cmd.push Church elder, John Loughrey, explained: People are able to drive straight in off the Duke Street Roundabout and we have staff in high vis jackets to direct them. When they come in we just ask them to pop their boot open and we can place the bags of food inside. They dont even have to get out of their car. They are only there for a few minutes and it means we can still serve people the best we can. Mr Loughery said the recipients of the food parcels, which contain tinned and dried goods and fresh vegetables, have been very grateful. googletag.cmd.push There was a man who contacted us on Facebook andhe has seven kids. He said you have no idea what this means to me And there was another woman who rang for help and we left her round three bags of food. She rang us back in tears saying this is exactly what I need. We are here tohelp. If Jesus was here he wouldnt be sitting with the rich and famous hed be among the people. As the Cornerstone City Church cannot hold services at the moment it has moved them online. We usually have people from across the city coming to our church, said Mr Loughery. There are people from the Protestant community and the Catholic community. Were here to worship God. People are searching for something right now. There are people that are coming to us for food and they are wondering what are they about  They are sussing us out and thats great. “Our online videos have been shared and viewed thousands of times,” said Mr Loughrey.

Damien Groogan has been performing a marathon three-hour DJ set on Saturday nights since the lockdown regulations were introduced over a month ago. The Ballinascreen man told the County Derry Post how he decided to make the most of the collection of music he had amassed. He said: “I’ve a good bit of music gathered up so I thought I’d give it a go. I got a good slot on a Saturday night and I’ve stuck to it. googletag.cmd.push “There are a lot of lorry drivers there who would follow it for the craic and a lot of friends here and in America have shared it too. “A pile of people started sending me friend requests and I got messages telling me to keep at it, that I was raising people’s spirits. “The first week I had around  followers and by the second week it had grown to nearly .” Lockdown may have dragged for many people, but Damien has been keeping things light and doing his best to please those who are tuning in to hear his set. googletag.cmd.push “I try and keep it good and lively and not slow it down, just a mixture of everything – s and s and things for all ages,” he said. “I’m trying to play the right sort of music and keep everybody happy. I set up every Saturday night and the feedback has been great from people and other entertainers. “It’s about having a party in your own living room, lt the spirits and keep everybody up and going. I’ll keep it going as long as everyone enjoys it. “There are people up in Cavan that I deliver from in the lorry and they’re all watching it on a Saturday night with a drink in the house.”  The lorry driver says he is trying to replicate the feeling of a Saturday night out and is encouraged by the many people interacting with each other on the Facebook feed. “Getting people to talk among each other is great, it seems to be everybody’s highlight on a Saturday night.” said Damien, who is known locally as ‘Big Dee’. “People would send me messages looking for shout outs. I’d spend a good half hour beforehand reading through them and looking for birthdays and anniversaries and the like. “It’s great when you get the feedback through Facebook, especially afterwards when you see how many people have liked it, shared it and viewed it.” Damien broadcasts live on his Facebook page – damien.groogan – from around .pm every Saturday night and freely admits to enjoying himself during the set. “You’re living a Saturday night out but from the comfort of your own living room,” he said. “I do a three-hour set butflies in because everybody is enjoying it.

Damien Groogan has been performing a marathon three-hour DJ set on Saturday nights since the lockdown regulations were introduced over a month ago. The Ballinascreen man told the County Derry Post how he decided to make the most of the collection of music he had amassed. He said: “I’ve a good bit of music gathered up so I thought I’d give it a go. I got a good slot on a Saturday night and I’ve stuck to it. googletag.cmd.push “There are a lot of lorry drivers there who would follow it for the craic and a lot of friends here and in America have shared it too. “A pile of people started sending me friend requests and I got messages telling me to keep at it, that I was raising people’s spirits. “The first week I had around  followers and by the second week it had grown to nearly .” Lockdown may have dragged for many people, but Damien has been keeping things light and doing his best to please those who are tuning in to hear his set. googletag.cmd.push “I try and keep it good and lively and not slow it down, just a mixture of everything – s and s and things for all ages,” he said. “I’m trying to play the right sort of music and keep everybody happy. I set up every Saturday night and the feedback has been great from people and other entertainers. “It’s about having a party in your own living room, lt the spirits and keep everybody up and going. I’ll keep it going as long as everyone enjoys it. “There are people up in Cavan that I deliver from in the lorry and they’re all watching it on a Saturday night with a drink in the house.”  The lorry driver says he is trying to replicate the feeling of a Saturday night out and is encouraged by the many people interacting with each other on the Facebook feed. “Getting people to talk among each other is great, it seems to be everybody’s highlight on a Saturday night.” said Damien, who is known locally as ‘Big Dee’. “People would send me messages looking for shout outs. I’d spend a good half hour beforehand reading through them and looking for birthdays and anniversaries and the like. “It’s great when you get the feedback through Facebook, especially afterwards when you see how many people have liked it, shared it and viewed it.” Damien broadcasts live on his Facebook page – damien.groogan – from around .pm every Saturday night and freely admits to enjoying himself during the set. “You’re living a Saturday night out but from the comfort of your own living room,” he said. “I do a three-hour set butflies in because everybody is enjoying it. I might even take a wee beer myself during it!”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Michael McWilliams writes a weekly column in the Irish News called Dodgy Tackle. For this weeks column, which is in todays Irish News, McWilliams puts forward his best ever team. The criteria for selection is based on the premise that his World XI must be made up of up of players from dferent countries who have never played for the same club sides. McWilliamssfinal selection includes many of the worlds best known footballers - and our very own Felix Healy. googletag.cmd.push His full line-up is: Manuel Neur , Junior , Paul McGrath , Paolo Maldini , Felix Healy , Paul Gascoigne , Dragan Stojkovic , Zinedine Zidane , Kevin de Bruyne , Kenny Dalglishand Diego Maradona . Explaining his choice of Healy in the midfield, McWilliams states that it was a straight fight between the Derry man and the Colombian World Cup Carlos Valderrama. He writes: Carlos Valderrama nearly went in here, but when it comes to moustachioed midfield fulcrums, the Derry man gets in on a dodgy decision. And it is Dodgys decision. Hes playing at the base of the Diamond. Just across from the Sandwich Co. Pulled the strings for an early eighties Coleraine side that delighted this young fan, all shimmies and subtlety. The only things hairier than his upper lip were the legs bulging out of a pair of royal blue Adidas hotpants, briefly ditched for a pair of white ones as he led the Honduras midfield a merry dance for  thrilling minutes at the  World Cup.

The working paper has been drafted following a video conference between all three parties on Tuesday when the PFAI submitted a high-level paper prepared by their world governing body FIFPRO on protocols around player safety. Those recommendations have now been incorporated into the FAI’s working document - entitled ‘Return To Football – Behind Closed Doors’ - around best practice for the staging of matches when senior Irish football gets the green light to resume action from the HealthService Executive . googletag.cmd.push This document incorporates all elements around the safe staging of games behind closed doors to ensure the health and safety of players, match officials and club employees and volunteers. All clubs have been asked to assess the document andtheir views to the working group. NLEC chairperson Noel Byrne said: “This working document is the next step in assessing what is best for Irish footballthe HSE and the Government give the green light for ato action, but behind closed doors. The document is the produce of very fruitful, positive and considered talks between the NLEC, the FAI and the PFAI. googletag.cmd.push “It is vital that we examine what is needed in the event of games going on in closed stadiums, from a health and safety perspective for all stakeholders and from a financial aspect as far as the clubs are concerned. This document, produced by all stakeholders working together, presents options to the clubs and we look forward to their views when they have had a chance to study the document.” PFAI General Secretary Stephen McGuinness said: “We welcome the opportunity to be part of this very important debate in these dficult times for Irish football. Our players are keen to support the efforts of the FAI and the NLEC to examine ato football in a manner that is safe for all involved be they players, match officials or club staff. “The FIFPRO document is a high-level recommendation and the FAI have put together the fine details of what playing behind closed doors looks like for all concerned. This is very much a work in progress with all stakeholders working together towards the best solution possible for our game in the event of a closed doors recommendation from the HSE and Government.” The FAI and the NLEC remain committed to looking at alternative income streams for SSE Airtricity League clubs in the event of ato National League football behind closed doors, with live streaming opportunities under discussion. Interim Deputy CEO of the FAI, Niall Quinn said: “The working document presented to the clubs today offers a real  for debate about ato football when we get the go-ahead from Government and health officials. They will of course have the final say on when weand under what circumstances, but it is imperative on us as a working group to present the best options available to our clubs. “This document offers the clubs an insight into best practice for staging games behind closed doors. The Association also remains committed to exploring the best financial proposition available to our clubs and players at this time. Analysis of the financial impact of playing behind doors is well underway with our clubs and we are examining potential revenue streams from live streaming and other sources. This is a united effort and we look forward to further engagement with the NLEC, the PFAI, the referees and the clubs themselves.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In addition, another  food parcels were delivered by last Friday.Local council officials have been working in partnership with their colleagues across local government, health trusts and the Department for Communities to set up the hubs.Down Leisure Centre has been transformed into a processing centre to organise deliveries, with other sites currently being identied should they be required, with staff working in split shts, while observing social distancing and other safety protocols.The new service covers the councilrsquos seven even district electoral areas with deliveries focusing on food supplies with the packages including items such as tinned and dried food, cereals and some essential toiletries.Requests for help from the council and its community and voluntary partners are arriving via Access NI which is processing calls from across Northern Ireland on a freephone helpline.Council chairman Charlie Casey says he is pleased to see just how many of the districtrsquos most vulnerable residents have been able to receive food parcel deliveries recently.ldquoOur sincere thanks go to all our partners who worked with us over the Easter break to achieve this and all the volunteers who have already kindly offered their help, he continued.ldquoIt is important that we provide a leline to those following medical advice to shield to protect their health, or who are self-isolating, and have no other means of assistance.The council chairman said that during the local authorityrsquos COVID- response, it will continue to work hard to deliver essential supplies to those who need them and ensure no-one feels alone or isolated at this dficult time.A COVID- community helpline is operational, with those in vulnerable groups seeking support asked to make contact between am and pm, seven days a week, with the helpline managed by Advice NI who are processing calls from across Northern Ireland.The Freephone number is   , while the email is covid@adviceni.net.

Therersquos plenty like me and we are all in the same boat.ldquoIt started when I received requests from nurses who I made their wedding or bridesmaid dresses in the past for. I ended up making scrubs for some entire hospital wards, male and female and in a iety of sizes.ldquoThat widened out to sewing for staff at local nursing homes. I just want to do something to help, particularly for nursing homes as my daughter, Abigail, works in one in Castlewellan.There is plenty of work to be done to complete her bridal orders, but Mrs Moorhead feels that her priority is for scrubs.ldquoMy weddings have been pushed back until October or November or even next year. There are things that would hamper me. I canrsquot see brides to fit them and I wouldnrsquot want to go too far ahead with orders in case some people gain weight or lose weight, she said.ldquoAlso,the wedding changes seasons, that can change the outfit ordered in style and colour. For instance, a mother of the bride might want a jacket as well or might want to lose or shorten sleeves so I feel I canrsquot go to far ahead with my orders. Brides have needed me to reassure them that everything will be alright for their big day, whenever it happens, and I can absolutely promise that.ldquoAbigail is getting married in November and her sister, Johanna, is getting married next May, so they will be the most special wedding dresses I will make in my letime. I feel that I have to keep going with the scrubs as itrsquos so important. However, I will make sure that I will provide all outfits that have been ordered from me. It has become a family affair as Mrs Moorheadrsquos husband, Joe, who also is unable to work as an engineer in the lockdown, helps with the pressing of the garments while Johanna helps with the sewing.Mrs Moorhead has been creating the scrubs from donated material, much of it brand new, and is very grateful for the donations..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar man takes Chance with move to Hong Kong 26 years later opens superstore  ","story":"AT the age of  and without a word of Cantonese, Richard Bowsie left his family and friends behind in his home village of Crossgar for a le of adventure in Hong Kong.Twenty-six years later and now a married father of two, Richard has found love, happiness as well as a successful career as the owner of two second-hand furniture stores in the huge cosmopolitan city with over seven million inhabitants.He and his locally-born we, Mavis, run nd Chance Furniture that provides shoppers in the city and online across the world a virtual Aladdinrsquos Cave with thousands of unique and affordable items - ranging from lacquered tables to pool tables, Chinese vases to Balinese drums.While other young ambitious men were told to lsquogo westrsquo, Richard went east, finding Hong Kong to be every bit as much the land of opportunity as the United States.The father of eight year-old daughter Kailey and son George, whorsquos coming five, literally changed his le in three days when he made the decision to fly to Hong Kong.From working as a leguard at the Tropicana centre in Newcastle and at the former Down Leisure Centre, the former student of the High School, Ballynahinch, had been close to completing his BTec qualication in Leisure Management at the former Newcastle College of Further Education.He ped out of his course a few months shy of graduation due to bullying. While his parents, Margaret and Ken, a well-known architect, were shocked at their middle sonrsquos decision, they were not surprised.He recalled: ldquoI had a friend who had travelled to Hong Kong three months previously. During a phone call he told me that the new international airport was under construction and work was easy to find. Three days later I arrived.ldquoI decided to go by myself as I had been trying to find an exciting job at home for a while but kept being told I was too young for the roles or lacked experience. My parents knew I was ambitious and how frustrated I was becoming with my career ambitions being knocked back all the time.Richard admitted he hadnrsquot a clue what to do once he arrived and took a bar managerrsquos job as an interim position as many of the airport workers drank there.His first job at the airport turned out to be with the Northern Ireland company, Lagan Construction Group, before going to another Belfast-based company, Rotary International, with which he worked for two years.ldquoI felt excited and nervous all at the same time when I first moved to Hong Kong, said Richard.ldquoThe first thing that struck me was the heat, after leaving cold and damp of home. Arriving in  degrees and high humidity was certainly a shock to the system, despite having been on family holidays to France most years with my family and once to America with a cross community group. The heat in Asia was a massive shock.Having grown up in a rented manse on the Rademon estate, Richard swapped a quiet rural existence for the hustle and bustle of the global port and major commerce centre. It was still under British rule and would remain so for another three years before it was handed back to China.Richard said: ldquoLanguage was the biggest shock but I made it my mission to learn the language and enrolled in YMCA lessons but also managed to pick it up from also working alongside locals.It wasnrsquot long before Richard felt confident enough to start out his own business, an electrical supply company which employed  staff.He said: ldquoI knew after the first few months that Hong Kong was going to work for me,you worked hard, nothing could hold you back, age was not an issue here. Opening a business here was very straight forward, just need a bank account and register an address.He met his we Mavis during his first month in the city and the two have been together ever since.They opened their first store in  in the after seeing a large amount of good furniture being thrown away each week and were determined to do something that would reduce the waste and help the environment. Within months, they had outgrown this store and relocated to their current , sq ft premises in Tuen Mun.The couple has recently opened a second, , sq ft premises in Chai Wan which is closer to the busy capital.Fluent in Cantonese for many years, Richard has seen Hong Kong go through many challenges, not in the least with the recent coronavirus pandemic.ldquoHong Kong has handled the virus very well, having been through SARS and bird flu before, said Richard. ldquoAs soon as we heard there was an issue over the border in China, Hong Kong went straight into prevention measures before even being advised to. Now everyone wears masks and observes hygiene measures.The preventative measures must have been successful as the city recorded zero deaths on Monday for the first time since the outbreak before Christmas.While the move to Hong Kong was the right one for Richard, he still misses home and his brothers and sisters, Simon, Gillian, Laura and William.He said: ldquoI miss the food, the greenery and, of course, my family who are all still in Northern Ireland. I miss being close to home as I have lost family members and grandparents.ldquoBut we come home as often as we can. Mavis and the kids love Crossgar, especially AJs Diner. They love the Rademon estate where we lived beside, walks down the Church Road to Kilmore and the open green fields. We have very few here in Hong Kong and any we do have are full of mosquitos.Home is always on Richardrsquos mind, as is his business.He adds: ldquoNext for our business is hopefully more expansion as I would like to start exporting furniture to other countries such as Northern Ireland.

OrsquoHare has the advantage as he is stable amateur to Navan trainer Noel Meade.Noel McParlan also got on the scoreboard and he was the top local point-to-point rider.Last week proved to be a sad one for local racing on Easter Sunday as Dr Fitz Gillespie, MBE, passed away suddenly at the age of . He was the GP in Tynan, Co Armagh, for  years.Dr Gillespie was one of the nicest men that I have ever met and was a long serving member of the Turf Club and IHRB. Although I donrsquot remember him riding, I know he did so for many years, and was also a trainer and owned horses right up to .His son, Pat, also rode as an amateur and professional, spending a good bit of his riding days with Jeremy Maxwell at Ballee. I can recall him winning on Raise An Argument at Downpatrick. Like his father, he also trained and one of his locally based owners was Joe McGrath, from Annacloy.Dr Gillespie was a regular steward at local meetings and also at many Southern racecourses. He was also a good supporter of the former Downpatrick Racecourse Supporters Club. He acted as a steward at the Armagh PTSP on April .He is predeceased by his first we, Dr Barbara, and also Lady Jane Alexander. He is survived by sons Pat and Rollo, daughter Gael, son-in-law, daughters-in-law and grandchildren.A memorial service will be held for Dr Gillespie at a later date as the funeral was private due to Covid-.

Mr James said bluntly yesterday:ldquoThere are people who had an opportunity to say things at an early stage but did not. Now they have really pulled the carpet out from under our feet at an advanced stage. Irsquom bitterly disappointed at this kind of timing.The problem arose when the Housing Executive was in the final stages of preparing a scheme, which has been on the drawing board for several years, when it was told of the Government objections to a number of potential sites, including the Burren River catchment area and another, the most important, at the Dundrum Road end of the town.The Executive had finally got an agreement to purchase from the landowner of the Dundrum Road site and had made a final routine check with the Government departments before clinching a deal. It was only then that the objections were revealed by Stormont, which had been kept informed of all moves over the years.DOWNPATRICK ndash A Downpatrick woman has been named as one of the top ten lsquoWomen of the Yearrsquo by the readers of a daily newspaper.Mrs Terry Dunbar was selected by readers of the Belfastand is to be honoured at the Woman of the Year Luncheon in the City Hall, Belfast, next month.Mrs Dunbar works by day in the occupational therapy department of the Downshire Hospital, Downpatrick, and most of her spare time is spent in voluntary work for the mentally ill and mentally handicapped.She is secretary of the Newcastle Society for Mentally Handicapped Children and is leader of the Down Peter Pan Club for children under .One of the most successful activities of the club is riding. ldquoI take members to the Newcastle Riding Centre every other Saturday and the people there are very good.Mrs Dunbar also runs the Gateway Club at the Downshire Hospital where the members ages range from early s to elderly.KINAHALLA ndash The decision to scrap the Kinahalla Dam project in the Mournes has been welcomed this week as lsquoa decision of sanityrsquo.The comment was made by Dr Arthur Mitchell, chairman of Komrade , the main opposition group to the scheme.Dr Mitchell said: ldquoBasically Komrade is delighted with the decision of the Water Appeals Commission. They have agreed with us that the water which they required was not there and this scheme would have caused serious ecological damage.Confirmation that the objectors had won the fight over the Kinahalla scheme came on Friday, when the Environment Minister, Mr Philip Goodhart, said his department had accepted the findings of the Commission which came out against the pound. million project.News that the Commission had recommended the scheme should be ped was leaked last month.

It is also my understanding that Newry, Mourne and Down Council and Northern Irelandrsquos other  councils are working closely alongside the government department at this time.Cllr Walker said he would like to see the recycling centres open again, suggesting that strict controls could be introduced to only allow two vehicles access them at any one time.ldquoI would also appeal to people at this time to keep their waste until the recycling centres are open again. I appreciate that many people who are not at work at the moment are making the most of the time they have to clean out their homes, sheds and garages and I commend them for being active.ldquoHowever, it simply isnrsquot on to load up you car with waste, drive to a secluded area and dump it. I just donrsquot understand the mentality of people who engage in this kind of behaviour.Cllr Walker also said the cost of clearing up illegal waste is borne by the districtrsquos ratepayers.ldquoWe have the ironic situation that those who dump their waste illegally end up paying for its removal viatheir rates. This beggars belief, he declared. ldquoThe stupidity of those who dump waste in secluded areas is beyond me.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe time has come for common sense and people really need to catch a grip of themselves. One of the most worrying aspectsof illegal dumping is that waste which ends up in fields is sometimes eatenby livestock which often results in deadly consequences. To those who dump their waste illegal my appeal is stop now.The local council has confirmed that it is receiving increasing reports about fly-tipping across the district since the start of the COVID- crisis. But the organisation insists that it is currently able to manage the issue within existing resources.A council spokesman said that the organisation continues to work closely with the Environment Agency which also performs a key role in addressing incidents of larger illicit dumping.On the issue of reopening the districtrsquos household recycling centres, the spokesman explained that the decision is continually being reviewed in line with government social distancing measures.He continued: ldquoFly-tipping is illegal and the council will strictly enforce this where evidence can be gathered. Responding to fly-tipping incidents also erts important council resources away from providing other essential services.The spokesman confirmed that the council is unable to remove illicitly-dumped waste from privately-owned land, explaining that where this occurs, both it and the Environment Agency has the legal powers to request its removal.He said the council will enforce this where required.The spokesman added: ldquoThe council would urge the public to avoid producing any unnecessary waste, including undertaking DIY and house and garden clearances at this time due to the considerable pressure being placed on public services.ldquoAny additional waste that is produced should be stored for future disposal at the household recycling centres once they re-open.

In a glittering playing career, the Ballykinlar man went on to win two more All-Ireland medals and established himself as one of the legends of the Gaelic football. Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals. He was the leading scorer in Ulster for eight seasons and in Ireland for three years.Now in his s, hersquos followed Downrsquos fluctuating fortunes ever since, relishing in theof the glory days in the early s, sharing in the disappointment of the barren times and casting a critical eye from the sidelines, though always with the optimistic outlook of the true fan.So what does he believe is the greatest Down team of all time Not surprisingly, given their accomplishments, hersquos largely selected his choice from his team-mates from the Sixties mdash though with typical modesty, he has not picked himself for the starting .ldquoYou have to remember that the Down team of s was the first to bring the Sam Maguire over the border, he says.ldquoThat was a really big achievement and we had beaten Kerry in the final. We had shown we were the best team in Ireland and we proved that again the following year in the final against Offaly after beating Kerry in the semi-final. We also beat Kerry in the  final, which meant that we had beaten them three times.ldquoKerry have always been the benchmark. If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 Queen.jpg","title":"Queen Karen Europe’s best  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH grandmother is a European powerlting champion at the age of .Karen Burns won the European title in France in March and set a new world record in the process.Powerlting involves three disciplines mdash squat, bench press and deadlt mdash and Karen capped a brilliant performance with a world record breaking lt of  kilos in the deadlt.Itrsquos a fantastic achievement for Karen, who only took up powerlting four years ago.The legal secretary, who has two daughters and four grandchildren, started gym classes at the age of , but within a few months made the switch to powerlting.Coached by Aaron Kelly, from Affinity Fit at the CG Fitness gym in Annacloy, she trained four times a week and was soon competing and winning medals at a national, international and world levels.She was the British champion two years running in  and .

I noticed within the first several days that I was able to breath more easily in the mornings and I was coughing much less. I am not a smoker.ldquoThe incessant pace of traffic in the street has slowed to a hush and my window sills inside my house are much cleaner. Before the lockdown, I could have drawn a line across the sills with my finger and it would have left a white mark in the soot which would gather.ldquoHaving the time that lockdown has inadvertently provided, I decided I would respond to a call-out to have-a-go playwrights to write something about their experience of self isolation.Gavin describes the scene as he pulled out the plug to let the water away. ldquoIt suddenly came to me as I watched the water drain away that it was an analogy for humanity, that we too are in great danger of being sucked down the plug hole to oblivion.So I got ready and immediately wrote the whole play sitting on the edge of my bed. It took me  minutes and I spent the next three weeks reworking it until I was happy.Central to the play is Jake, a man in his late s, who is in self-isolation and being cared for by his put-upon daughter, Martha.Gavin explains: ldquoWhile shersquos out getting groceries, he ponders upon the plight of the human race as it is metaphorically sucked down the plughole to oblivion.ldquoThroughout the play, Jake is visited by several characters mdash a City shark who represents the financial markets, a Navy er who see that humanity is in terrible trouble, the Prime Minister and God, who commands a less-than-enthusiastic Jake to build an ark and save mankind.Gavin says Jake becomes overwhelmed thinking that itrsquos too big of a job to build an ark. Hersquos not surehe has got the energy.ldquoThe play also includes two young mothers debating a brutal and radical way to build a new plug from the flesh and bone of every misfit in society, two floating dim-witted teenagers and a dancing bath plug bearing a last minute solution to the problem, said Gavin.ldquoAt the end of the play, Jakersquos lottery numbers come up and his winning ticket appears in the beak of a dove mdash the Christian symbol for peace.Down the Plughole, which reads as a tragicomedy, shines a spotlight on modern society and its impending doomlove and kindness fail to prevail.Gavin says he has taken inspiration from two comic plays, One Man, Two Guvnors by Richard Bean and Government Inspector by Nikolai Gogol, and the classic novel by William Golding, Lord of the Flies.Gavin added: ldquoJake realises that in the end money is worthless and that love and good health, which are in short supply in the play, are all that is important.Amelia Madan, head of amateur plays at Josef Weinberger Plays, said: ldquoDown the Plughole is a hilarious, ludicrous and bold play for these crazy unchartered times.ldquoWe are delighted Gavin chose to put some of the uncertainty about out fate as a species we all feel, into words, with a generous dash of delicious absurdism and a fabulous ending..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Spa.jpg","title":"Spa Wells LOL provide gift packs to health workers  ","story":"LOCAL Orangemen have been looking out for frontline workers during the current public health emergency.Members of Spa Wells Orange Lodge distributed free gt packs which included Easter eggs and cosmetics for health workers based at two local nursing homes.Approximately  staff who care for elderly residents at Fishbourne House and Spa Nursing Home were thrilled to receive their pamper packs and thanked the lodge for thinking of them in the current situation.Lodge member John Aiken said they were delighted with the success of their community project and added they are currently working on another similar community-based initiative..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11291132.jpg","title":"nathan carter concert helps heroes fund top  ","story":"PLEASENOTEIt is a tough time for our entire community and especially the business community.

This would be known as Serious Condition Criteria.While widely welcomed, what was not made clear was Departmental staff have discretion around who meets criteria and can overrule a claimantrsquos medical evidence.A number of enquiries were submitted to the Department under a Freedom of Information request.The responses are concerning.The Department stated legislation does not refer to serious conditions but rather whether there is a relevant change of circumstances. The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who are unlikely to ever move into work: ldquoTook effect from  September , but did not result in legislative change.The Department was asked about the right of appealing a decision rejecting a claimant for Serious Conditions Criteria, who responded: ldquoThere is no automatic right of appeal against a determination which is embodied in or necessary to a decision. , a claimant has a right of appeal against an outcome decision rather than a determination, which is merely a component of the outcome decision.This was complicated for non-legally trained or represented claimants, so questions were put around full compliance with the Disability Discrimination and Human Rights.The Department responded stating it: ldquoDoes not hold any information relating to this hellip.may have been undertaken by DWP.A copy of the risk-assessment template used by the Department in instances of considering Serious Condition Criteria, was requested, but: ldquoNo template existsInstead, the response referred to assessment procedures where Departmental Healthcare Professionals advise on the re-referral period, and consider whether a claimantrsquos condition meets: ldquoThe new severe conditions criteria andno further assessments are required.However, the claimantrsquos own medical professionalrsquos opinion around Serious Condition Criteria could be over-ruled, with this decided by: ldquoAn Administrative Officer appointed by the Department.In respect of providing the legislation or guidance which permits the Department to overrule clinical opinion provided by a claimant seeking consideration under the Serious Condition Criteria, the response referred to ESA Regulations , which: ldquoProvides for the redetermination of whether someone has limited capability for work. The time period in relation to this is not set down in the legislation but is largely at the Department Decision Makers discretion ndash usually based on available medical evidence including medical reports from ATOS hellip The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who would be unlikely to ever move into work, took effect from  September  but did not result in legislative change.As the Freedom of Information request was answerd prior to the restoration of devolution, the Department was asked with a Minister now in post, to comment on current processes around Serious Condition Criteria decision-making and in particular, how it can by discretion supersede a medical diagnosis by a claimantrsquos clinician. It was also askedprocedures are under review andthere is intention to bring forward legislation to allow for scrutiny or challenge.A spokesperson said: ldquo Anyone claiming ESA will be automatically assessed for the Severe Conditions criteria at their Work Capability Assessment by a Healthcare Professional. If the personrsquos condition or its al effects meet the criteria, the Department will be advised that no further assessments are required.In response to the overruling of clinical decisions, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe Work Capability Assessment looks at the al effects of a personrsquos condition, rather than the diagnosis itself. It is not a supersession of the opinion of their clinician.This dfered to the response provided prior to the Minister taking office, which appeared to show the Department was permitted to over-rule the evidence of claimantrsquos clinician.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reality is we will look at the medical evidence. The Northern Ireland Executive will have its own flexibility and we may see across the country some iations we saw some iations going into lockdown as well. Itrsquoll be a decision that all four nations take together based on the evidence, he said.Mr. Lewis said he was aware of the complexities of Northern Irelandrsquos Border with the Republic of Ireland amid the pandemic, explaining that he has been meeting with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle OrsquoNeill and Taacutenaiste Simon Coveney.ldquoEven where there are dferences in the approach between the Republic and the North,there are,we know that we can make sure we are clear with residents why those dferences are there.ldquoThe challenge of having iations within Northern Ireland is how we manage that.An investigation in The Sunday Times at the weekend featured a Whitehall source claiming the government ldquomissed the boat on testing and PPEand ldquojust watched as the death toll mounted in Wuhan, China.The report also claimed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson missed five crucial COBRA meetings in the Cabinet Office in London.When asked to respond to these serious allegations, Mr. Lewis said: ldquoI didnrsquot recognise some of what I saw in the Times.ldquoI was in the Cobra meetings in January and February COBRA meetings are chaired by the Secretary of State in the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms. Itrsquos a place, not a thing.ldquoWe were making decisions the scientists and medical experts were making decisions at that time and planning was going on. This is the point to judge it now when we have two months more evidence is dangerous and a misleading thing to do.Turning to PPE which has been an issue in Fermanagh, Mr. Lewis used his own constituency of Great Yarmouth as an example of where there has been ldquono problems with accessing equipment.He added: ldquoWersquove had gowns sent over to the UK, OrsquoNeills [sportswear] converted to gowns, there is gin distillery in your part of the world producing sanitisers.ldquoWersquore shting five and a half million pieces of PPE across to Northern Ireland. Wersquove been able to supply that itrsquos in good order. I am talking to the first minster every day that.Mr. Lewis said the priority of the United Kingdom government is to make sure ldquowe donrsquot hit the second peak of the virus.ldquoOne of the most damaging things economically would be, as well as health wise, to start coming out of lockdown ndash restaurants, pubs, whatever start opening again ndash and suddenly you have to close down again and thatrsquos not viable.ldquoI think itrsquos right to be cautious about this wersquoll make that decision in a few weeks.ldquoThe science is shting on this the experience is changing. I am cautious about predicting what will be in a few weeksrsquo time.He believes the government could ldquoflatten the curve of Covid-people continue to stay at home, adding: ldquoWe want to see past the peak, you donrsquot want to see a downward trend and ease up as all you do is let it shoot back up again.ldquoIf you think back to the beginning there were some quite scary numbers being put about by some experts about what the deaths might be. Now any death is too many and we have sadly lost people, friends and family who have gone through tragic experiences recently, and the figures are nowhere near those numbers we saw at the beginning.ldquoThatrsquos because the public across Northern Ireland and the UK have done a good job generally of following the guidelines which means we can flatten that curve, he said.Mr. Lewis explained that he had personal experience of people close to him who had been diagnosed with Covid-, including his parliamentary private secretary.ldquoSomeone I know lost a member of their family this week, I have a few people in family who had the disease.

There is a transition period where you are not really the Archbishop of Armagh but you want to be as helpful as you can and you are also I suppose trying to work out what and how you are going to approach the task.The Archbishop-Elect explained the three facets to the roleHe said there was the appointment of Bishop of the Diocese of Armagh, which has a larger population with a great number of large towns in it than Clogher Diocese.In addition, there is the role of Primacy of All Ireland, considered lsquoFirst among equalsrsquo acknowledging there is another Primate in the southern province but to some degree to be an ambassador for the Church of Ireland.He added: ldquoThe third element is your place within the wider Anglican Communion which I have relatively little experience of. You become a member of the Primatersquos Meeting which is one of the instruments of communion within Anglicanism. There are a number of ways we hold ourselves together, the Lambeth Conference, the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Anglican Consultative Council and more recently, the Primatersquos Meeting.So what type of church do you see under your leadership ldquoItrsquos dficult to speak for the church as the Church of Ireland General Synod is the body which has that authority. There is a saying that the Church of Ireland is synodically governed and episcopally led. What the Archbishop of Armagh can do is to speak to the Church and suggest can concern itself with. It sets a bit of a tone as well. Itrsquos about its spiritual le and its own governance and the need to acknowledge that like probably all institutions and all bodies some bits of it do well and some do not do well some bits are growing and some bits are shrinking some bitsvery well and some bitsnot so well and to maybe try to discover that the bits that do not do well could do a bit better, in terms of spiritual le and acknowledging there is a huge ersity within Anglicanism and to remember that thatrsquos all part of the Anglican heritage.ldquoThere are obviously particularly challenges at the moment, what the church says to society and what it does for the society in which it is placed. You cannot pretend it doesnrsquot live in a political context. Politics is not something that just happens in Parliament. Democracies are places where political discussion or dialogue are about what we can do together or decisions which are deeply embedded. There are institutions which are recognisable bodies in civil society such as the business community, trade unions, voluntary sector and churches are one of those. I think they have their particular things to say and its perfectly legitimate for them to say it.ldquoThe big imponderable at the moment is coronavirus and we have no idea how deeply that will affect the patterns of society. We could come out the other side of that challenge a changed society, with maybe small changes and maybe some very profound changes. Of course the other big external issue is Brexit which involves the relationships between the dferent regions within Ireland and the United Kingdom.ldquoI could be in both parts of that jurisdiction in one day praying for good governance for both of them and for their leaders, he said.In terms of reaching out to people in the Church of Ireland, the Archbishop-Elect recalled how a Northern Ireland Le and Times survey revealed around  per cent of people in Northern Ireland attend church at some point. He said the heyday for attending church was in the period from the late th Century to the period to the middle of the s. But he thinks current attendance is ldquoback to the old norm with fewer people committed to regular churchgoing.He rightly points out that churches are among the very few inter-generational bodies with people of dferent ages attending.The Archdeacon-Elect says people in very small rural parishes are committed to their churches in the sense that they are contributing to their community who feel it is being enriched with their presence. He said the church finds its place in the community.ldquoThe second challenge is what we are for ourselves as a group, as a faith community, how we build up the church, which canrsquot live in isolation but we have our particular family traditions - how we contribute to the ersity of Ireland, how we build up the church to be confident communities of faith and not hesitant or fearful or invisible communities of faith.He said for the Church of Ireland, there was tremendous heritage from Anglicanism.ldquoThe Church of Ireland has a particular way of doing things, liturgically. Liturgy is both the expression and source of our belief. Our vocation may be to hold together what on the face of it appear to be contradictory things is maybe one of our roles in religious and spiritual le. I have no ideait is the best way to be a Christian but it is our way and it seems to contribute something to the catholic church, the wider church.ldquoHarry McAdoo, a well-known Archbishop of Dublin and a great scholar, once said, lsquoIf I hadnrsquot been born an Anglican, I would have had to become one.rsquoThe Archbishop-Elect leaves Clogher Diocese after forging and maintaining good relations with other denominations.He said: ldquoI think the vast majority of committed Christian people see more in common with other Christian traditions than separating us. There is a very long history of ecumenism in the diocese of Armagh as well. There is a long association and friendship with Archbishop Eamon Martin and I hope we can continue to build relationships and friendships.The Archbishop-Elect trained for Church of Ireland ministry after a career in industry in which he held a senior role in Shorts and was for a time, Assistant Director of the CBI in Northern Ireland.ldquoThat probably give me some skills in organisation and about leadership. Irsquove been very lucky here. Irsquom not very fond of the word lsquoleaderrsquo in the ecclesiastical world but one of the things a leader does is to build a team around him. It is almost a contradiction in terms to be involved in a leadership role in Christianity, to do it on your own.ldquoThere are certain things as a bishop that end with you. There are plenty of lonely moments in that sense where you have to make decisions. But by and large business acclimatised me to working with all sorts of dferent people from all sorts of dferent backgrounds in dferent ways and to experience what every parishioner experiences, normal working le with those pressures.As Bishop of Clogher the new Archbishop-Elect held a number of positions nationally and internationally representing the Church.He was the Church of Ireland contact person to the Churches of the Porvoo Communion which represents the Scandanavian and Baltic Lutherans as well as the Spanish and Portuguese Anglicans and other Anglican churches and provinces from these islands making contact at senior level travelling with them.He has also held senior roles on the Irish Council of Churches, the national ecumenical instrument and also the Irish Inter-Church meeting, the latter which includes the Roman Catholic church.He said those bodies were important especially as ecumenism was becoming bland and it was important to keep going and keep talking.These inter-church bodies contribute to providing resources for churches around Brexit, homelessness, welfare reform and subjects churches would be expected to have a voice in.ldquoI enjoyed that hugely, I am coming to the end of that, six years in total two years as vice-President, two years as President and two years as outgoing Vice President. I will be involved again as a member of the Church Leadersrsquo Meeting.The Archbishop-Elect says of his time in Clogher Diocese ldquoItrsquos always been an aim of mine wherever I have worked to try to create a family atmosphere where there are degrees of mutual respect and degrees of mutual accountability. I remember saying that the diocese of Clogher is big enough to do thingswe all pull together in the same direction and small enough for everybody to be necessary for that to happen and to be accountable for what the contribution is. If you treat people with respect, then relationships are easier.ldquoBy and large I felt people were for me rather than against me. It helpsyou are reasonably interested in people and their families and what they do and acknowledge that as an important factor in their faith. Whoever the next Bishop of Clogher is theyshould allow him or her to be his or her own bishop of Clogher and not that they should be like me, Brian Hannon or Michael Jackson or like St. Macartan.The Archbishop-Elect says he enjoys reading history and poetry and in terms of music, takes particular pleasure in the tradition of Anglican anthems . He does admit to particularly enjoying the Psalms which are poetry.The Archbishop-Elect acknowledges that his mother who had a profound influence on his le, reciting the Daily Office at home and was happily committed to God and His Church and would have sung the Te Deum while washing the dishes. One of her favourite biblical phrases was from the Gospel of St. John, Chapter  ldquoI come that you would have le and that you might have it more abundantly.Relaxation for the Archdeacon-Elect is visiting one of his favourite places, the Ulster Museum to see the collection of Irish Art and reading.ldquoThe thing I am looking to reading most is I took possession of the third volume of Hilary Mantelrsquos Wolf Hall trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, lsquoThe Mirror and Light,rsquo an historical novel, he adds.The Archbishop-Electrsquos we Mary teaches in Enniskillen Royal Grammar School and his daughter, Dorothy, is at the University of Oxford.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
