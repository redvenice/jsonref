Housing estates were built on a sort of visionary, infectious hope, drawing on particular memories of bombed-out tenements and overcrowded room-and-kitchens. I once saw some letters sent to David Gibson, Glasgow’s messianic early 1960s housing convenor – “he took seven sugars in his tea”, his wife said – which came from citizens desperate to escape the slums. “Please put us down for one of your high-rises and all the clean air up there,” one woman wrote. The poet Hugh MacDiarmid tapped into a modernist hankering, a common wellspring of the better life, when he wrote that “there are ruined buildings in the world, but no ruined stones”. Outside the cities, just by Nirvana, they were building perfect “schemes” for those who knew how to live.The life of Motherwell was seen as an experiment that failed. As Orr would have been quick to say, all lives, looked at from a certain not un-Scottish perspective, are experiments that fail. But there are miracles too in the world of hard knocks, and Orr, by a kind of genius, finds the kernel of the town’s former existence, and locates the “mother” in its name. By doing so, finishing the book not long before she died last October at the age of 57, she produced what I believe to be the best memoir to appear out of Scotland since 1935, the year of Edwin Muir’s Scottish Journey. A good friend of mine and a former journalist of this parish – editor of Weekend magazine 1993-98, and later a columnist – she has left behind her a non-fiction book for the ages. Motherwell is a searching, truthful, shocking (and timely) observance of the blight that monetarist policies can bring about in a community of workers, indeed on a whole culture of fairness and improvement, while also showing – in sentences as clean as bone – the tireless misunderstandings that can starve a family of love.The family lived at 18 Clyde Terrace, a timber-clad, typical two-storey dwelling in the middle of others much the same, and she recalls the bureau that stood in the corner of the living room, overseen by her mother, Win, who managed all its papers, all its memories. Win could be a fierce custodian of the family narrative and she often recoiled from her brilliant daughter’s efforts to change the story. She once told me Deborah was “perverse”, and, of course, clever children must sometimes seem that way to their confused and fretful parents. Orr could be savage, thrawn and irrepressible, but she was also a born writer and a born improver of dull situations. Win worried about what people thought, Deborah didn’t. And over the years Win’s power came to seem entirely oppressive to her daughter, like the forces excoriating the town itself.On the west coast of Scotland they have as many expressions for embarrassment as the Inuit have for snow. You can be mortified or “black affronted” or “given a showing-up”, especially over matters of cleaning your house or paying your bills or “taking too much drink”. Early in Motherwell, it seems that Win is the engine of all this painful self-loathing, but then we see John, Deborah’s father, who is either an unskilled labourer at Ravenscraig (Deborah) or a trained engineer (Win). It shouldn’t really matter, but it does, very deeply, in the Orr scheme of things. Sifting through her memories as she tries to make sense of her life, Orr sees how she was never good enough, how life itself was never good enough, and that John was really a man of bigotry and anger. After Thatcherism, his world would be blown down in broad daylight, and he becomes an almost Hardyesque casualty of the land, someone carrying his trauma and his prejudices as if they were all he had.There is great accuracy in the book’s sociological depictions, great courage in its manner of uncovering family secrets. (There can be few better accounts of how the postwar working-class strove so complicatedly for “betterness”.) Yet the book’s greatness lies mainly in the psychological dimension, in the vivid portrait of her parents’ narcissism and the just-as-vivid portrait of her own, which to some heartbreaking degree was to prove the struggle of their lives. Her mother was traumatised by the war and by the expectations that followed. She clung on to her things, stuffing them into the bureau, but also to her disappointments, as if only they could define her, keep her voice central to the life of the family, cancelling any youthful or novel encroachments. All the time, Deborah is looking at Win and asking: “Did she mother well?” But she also asks who she is herself, how capable, how good. She writes about the history of violence and sectarianism, the scars they leave, and slowly, with a reporter’s skill, she shows the interior life of her people.On the day they blew Ravenscraig down, Deborah was there with her father, mother and brother David. They stood behind the cordon. “The crowd was sparse,” she writes. “There was still a lot of bitterness. It took six seconds for that huge, blue gasometer and those ... massive elegant cooling towers to come down … After the ... site was decommissioned, its buildings flattened and shovelled away, its earth decontaminated, there was just a big hole, in the town, in the shire, in so many people’s lives.” The local council let off some balloons, to represent every person who’d ever worked there, and the Orr family went home, like many others, to live out their myth of survival.In the present climate, this book should be given out on the NHS. It should also be dangled in the faces of one-nation opportunists, for whom working-class communities only become real when they vote Conservative. Motherwell shows, chapter and verse, the ravages of inidualism, yet it also has the guts to demonstrate how working-class identity may be weaponised for intolerance, and snared by eager bigots into voting for its own dissolution. Great books forge a connection between the movement of single minds and the fate of nations, and Deborah, by looking at her own Scottish family and herself, put her finger on the anger and narcissism of the current political moment: “The unsettling thing about group narcissism is that there’s a level on which it works really well. Group narcissism tends to keep inidual narcissism at bay. It helps to regulate the feelings of shame … Within the family, John’s expressions of contempt for others got him lots of attention.”Orr grew up in an atmosphere of what she calls “performative hate”. It’s not that her town had any sort of monopoly on that, but Motherwell’s decline, so spitefully speeded by the Thatcher “revolution”, got under the skin of many families, manacling them to a sense of waste. The proudest feature of her father’s life, according to him, was that he had never missed a day’s work in his life, a boast that persisted even after they made him redundant. People like to write about their people’s defiance, not their subservience, so this is a post-industrial story we have not quite heard before, allowing a genuine flushing-out of shame and fear about the whole ‘condition’ of the British working-class, as it used to be understood. The point is: it might never be understood that way again. Orr knew it was hard to speak up, and I believe she hoped for a new openness, ‘to take charge, to take complete control, of my own family, in my own words.’After dark, the lights of Ravenscraig could once be seen from the whole town, and far into the surrounding countryside. This book is like that, forging out of living memory a glowing vision of troubled belonging. In the writing of it, Deborah found a way to rise out of her sorrows and dependencies, her own difficult loves, and create a masterpiece of self-exploration. We can only mourn her loss and the brilliant books she might have written after this. On reading it, I thought again of how Kenneth Tynan once said he could never really love anybody who didn’t like Look Back in Anger. Well, let me put if differently, and say I shall feel sorry for those who dislike Motherwell, before admitting that feeling sorry comes all too easily.• Motherwell is published by Orion (RRP £16.99).

Prozac Nation, published just over 25 years ago, was raw and in-your-face, a bald, bold bid for our attention. She was 27 when she threw open this unvarnished account of her e into the black of depression, into a regime of pills – Prozac was only one of the many medications she was treated with – and darkness. In the book’s early pages she set out her stall, describing the creep of her illness, its deadly pull. “You won’t even notice it coming on, thinking that it is somehow normal, something about getting older, about turning eight or turning 12 or turning 15, and then one day you realise that your entire life is just awful, not worth living, a horror and a black blot on the white terrain of human existence. One morning you wake up afraid you are going to live.”Not everyone was convinced that Wurtzel’s introspection had much value to anyone beyond herself. “Prozac Nation is being hyped as a tract on youthful angst in the 90s, but it reads more like the self-absorbed rantings of an adolescent,” ran a review in Newsweek. Michiko Kakutani, writing in the New York Times, admitted to wanting to shake the author: “There are far worse fates than growing up during the 70s in New York and going to Harvard.” Yet Kakutani also praised “her forthrightness, her humour and her ability to write sparkling, luminescent prose”.And it was those qualities that struck me when I read the book – at 27, as it happens, for Wurtzel was just a few months older than I am. I, too, had lived with depression, with the mysterious shadow that was either a part of myself or beyond myself, I could never quite tell. Was this me, all the time, or could this be fixed? What was it, anyhow, that needed fixing? I had read William Styron’s memoir of his depression, Darkness Visible, when it came out in 1989, my final year in college it’s a book I still admire, yet Styron’s life was so far removed from mine that it was hard to find a real echo of my suffering in its pages. Suffering: it’s hard to type, even now. Who was I to suffer when there was, and is, so much real suffering in the world? But that’s not how depression works.Prozac Nation is a portrait of depression’s narcissism, the desperate focus on the self that blots out the rest of the world. But, if there here was no denying Wurtzel’s privilege, there was also no denying her pain: she gave it all to us, every last drop. When I found her book – thanks to all the hype that surrounded it – well, it was a godsend. It allowed me to begin to think about whatever it was I was going through. It also allowed me to consider the possibility of taking medication for an illness, as I took medication for other illnesses that, too, was an extraordinary personal liberation.If Prozac Nation now seems less remarkable than it did in 1994, that’s because it did mark a shift in the conversation. You could argue that it was one of the most characteristic literary products of the early 90s: the end of history, remember? The Berlin Wall had fallen, Clinton had yet to be impeached, Britain was now seamlessly connected to Europe thanks to the opening of the Channel tunnel: no need to look outward any more, so why not gaze right in? Not that the confessional memoir was really anything new: St Augustine had opened up the subject centuries before, and certainly it’s fair to say that Wurtzel’s memoir rhymes with books such as Sylvia Plath’s The Bell Jar and JD Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye.But those books are, of course, novels. The way in which we now take the most coruscating personal memoir for granted owes something to Wurtzel. Kathryn Harrison’s The Kiss, about incest, appeared a few years later into the new millennium came books such as James Frey’s A Million Little Pieces, about his drug addiction and recovery, and Rachel Cusk’s Aftermath, a powerful portrait of orce. Is there an echo of Wurtzel in Karl Ove Knausgaard’s obsessive detailing of his and his family’s lives over the six volumes of My Struggle? Perhaps.All these books, in their different ways, worked to begin difficult conversations and that is no bad thing. Wurtzel continued along the path of brutal self-revelation, and it didn’t always win her friends. But the way in which she revealed herself blew open a door. I would think of her work, too, when I read Andrew Solomon’s extraordinary book, The Noonday Demon: An Atlas of Depression, published in 2001. It is a memoir of his own bitter suffering, but also a complete engagement with how depression is viewed and treated across the world it looks both inward and outward, with both thoroughness and compassion.Sometimes, I admit, I’m forced to wonder if there is a downside to all this openness. Part of the pleasure – let’s call it that – of reading a book like Prozac Nation is the shocking sense that you, the reader, are privy to information to which you are not at all entitled. In our daily lives the sharing of this sort of information is a true intimacy, a marker that a friendship or relationship has crossed a very particular boundary. Confessional memoir leaps across that boundary with abandon. I wonder, now, if there is an unspoken or even an unconscious pressure on those who embark on memoir to give themselves away wholly, to hold nothing back, no matter what it might cost them – or those close to them.Yet the pull towards revelation, and the push back against it, has always been the compelling tension in the memoir form. How much is enough? How much is too much. Elizabeth Wurtzel was, in all her writing, thrillingly too much – and the world is a poorer place without her."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f1caa8bcc55bd15703b0e7ab243437d0c09045c/0_297_3936_2362/master/3936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e6b646c7b2ba5e73df8e2bc4382a4c1","title":"faa ban iran iraq us airlines","story":"Ban comes after Iran fired missiles against at least two Iraqi military bases hosting US-led coalition personnelThe US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it would ban US carriers from operating in the airspace over Iraq, Iran, the Gulf of Oman and the waters between Iran and Saudi Arabia after Iran launched a missile attack on US-led forces in Iraq.Tehran fired more than a dozen ballistic missiles from Iranian territory against at least two Iraqi military bases hosting US-led coalition personnel, the US military said on Tuesday.The FAA said it issued the airspace ban “due to heightened military activities and increased political tensions in the Middle East, which present an inadvertent risk to US civil aviation operations”.Several non-US airlines had flights over parts of Iraq and Iran at the time, according to FlightRadar24 data. They are not directly affected by the FAA ban, but foreign carriers and their national regulators typically consider US advice carefully when deciding where to fly.Before the latest guidance, the FAA had already prohibited US carriers from flying below 26,000ft over Iraq and from flying over an area of Iranian airspace above the Gulf and Gulf of Oman since Iran shot down a high-altitude US drone last June.Singapore Airlines said after the attack on US bases in Iraq that all of its flights would be erted from Iranian airspace.Carriers are increasingly taking steps to limit threats to their planes after Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down in 2014 by a missile over Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board.An international aviation team has been activated to support “effective coordination and communication” between airlines and countries as tensions mount in the Middle East after a US drone strike killed an Iranian military commander, the global airlines body the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Tuesday.Airlines and the United Nations’ aviation agency have started to monitor strategic airspace over Iran and Iraq. With some commercial carriers still serving those countries and others flying over their airspace, IATA also issued a statement reminding countries of their obligation to communicate potential risks to civil aviation.“It is critical that states live up to this obligation as tensions in the Middle East rise,” the group said, days after the killing of Gen Qassem Suleimani on Friday plunged the region into a new crisis.On Monday, Germany published a new warning for Iraq, indicating areas of concern for overflying traffic, according to a report published by the site Opsgroup.The coordination team operated by IATA and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) was activated as a “standard precautionary measure”, in the event that contingency measures are required by airlines, IATA said in a statement to Reuters.The team brings together airlines, regulators and air navigation service providers to ensure any potential risks to aviation are shared quickly, an industry source familiar with the group said.“Everyone’s urging restraint,” said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.Airspace controlled by Iran and Iraq are seen as strategic for commercial aviation in the Middle East. If there were the need to shut down the airspace, carriers would have to be rerouted which would lead to greater congestion and fuel costs, said the source.

We expect the food business to continue to be challenged.”The retailer did not see any change in shopping habits after the election in December, despite hopes of a so-called Boris bounce for retailers.Coupe said shoppers were being careful with their money as they waited for more clarity on the wider political and economic outlook.“Around or after the election there was no sign of change in terms of trading … there is nothing on the horizon that looks like it is going to change what’s been a challenging consumer environment,” he said.The only possible catalyst for change in the near future might be the budget, set for 11 March, Coupe said.The grocery market recorded the slowest Christmas sales growth in at least four years and all of the big four chains lost sales, according to the industry analysts Kantar.Tesco, the UK’s biggest supermarket group, is expected to report its Christmas trading performance on Thursday – but Kantar’s data suggests the retailer was outgunned by Sainsbury’s.The industry’s traditional players are under pressure from Aldi and Lidl, which increased their market share and achieved dramatic sales growth, partly driven by new store openings.Boots data indicated that the health and beauty chain was also under pressure from the German-owned discounters as well as B\u0026ampM, Home Bargains, and Select."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d56687ae2660d439f288f8a614069f71cd4b889d/156_371_5836_3500/master/5836.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cac0de07cd9d834ad579749d45247b3","title":"greggs to pay workers 7m bonus after vegan sausage roll success","story":"Bakery chain’s 25,000 employees will receive up to £300 in this month’s pay packetEmployees at Greggs are being rewarded with a £7m special bonus after the hugely successful launch of the bakery chain’s vegan sausage roll last year boosted sales and profits.The bakery chain’s 25,000 employees will receive up to £300 each in their pay packets this month – with shop floor staff and managers receiving the same amount. Greggs said it was making the one-off payment to workers “in recognition of their crucial contribution to business success”.Some 19,000 staff, who have been with the company before and up to March last year, will receive the full £300 payment. The rest will be given £75 for every quarter they have been with the company, up to the end of last year.It said it was making the payout to staff after giving shareholders a special idend of £35m last October as result of its stronger than expected trading.“The major investments we have made in recent years to make Greggs an attractive choice in the food-on-the-go market are delivering. Consumers are responding very positively and we have seen increasing visits from both new and existing customers,” he said.The business has achieved high levels of growth in a tough market in which many restaurant and retail chains have been forced to restructure and close stores.Greggs said strong demand for its traditional ranges and the “huge popularity” of its vegan sausage roll had driven sales. It is adding to its vegan menu with a vegan steak bake and doughnut. Over Christmas the chain sold a vegan-friendly sweet mince pie.Whiteside said Greggs faced potential cost inflation, particularly on pork, in the year ahead and the challenge of beating strong sales growth over the past year but continued to see further growth opportunities.The business expects to open about 100 new shops in the next 12 months and is experimenting with takeaway dinners by opening some of its shops later.

It’s really a debate over differing visions of the futureAnother lost election, another Labour leadership contest. And thanks to Ed Miliband’s contentious one-person-one-vote reforms, that inevitably puts the focus back on the party’s members. The most honest objection to the rules introduced under the reforms is that the right to choose the leader should never have been bestowed on the members. Not because they’re cranks or extremists, but because of the party’s composition – by definition, to have the surplus time and energy for monthly meetings and the annual conference puts you in a position of privilege. And this is borne out by the numbers: the majority of members are middle class, their average age 53. Why should that self-selecting band have rights in a two-party political system that others do not?I think the counter-argument is stronger: that a functioning democracy needs levers of pluralism, identifiable mechanisms by which anyone can influence the makeup and decisions of its representatives. The alternative is the so-called professionalisation of politics, whereby a much smaller group simply determines what the country wants or needs with the help of polling, focus groups and things they hear on the buses they pretend to travel on. This is a clear and straightforward debate, and as such is usually shelved in favour of a series of caricatures.Most commonly, the party is portrayed as having been taken over by a pincer movement of young extremists and the Trotskyist or Stalinist old guard (it is strange to have to look up, yet again, how you’re supposed to tell those apart). Shortly after Jeremy Corbyn’s victory in the 2016 challenge from Owen Smith, a “centrist” in my constituency Labour party described how the radicals who had been painstakingly rooted out in the 1980s had come back, like head lice – as if the hard left was always lying in wait for the host to be weakened. Even if we accept that 1980s militants all saw their chance and came rushing back, this does not go any way towards explaining the extent of the support for Corbyn. For the interpretation to hold, the militants would have to have not only re-entered the party en masse, but instantly persuaded the so-called soft left to share their agenda.In 2015 and again in 2016, Corbyn was the only left candidate on the slate. Members had taken their medicine, as they were routinely advised in the Miliband era: they accepted the idea that not opposing austerity, not attacking even corrupt businesses, not protecting public services, was the price of a fiscally responsible reputation, without which the party was sunk. The self-styled pragmatists had had their way, and sunk the ship anyway.So when Corbyn stood against an array of status quo candidates – more of the same with extra heart (Yvette Cooper), more of the same with extra toughness (Liz Kendall), more of the same with longer eyelashes (Andy Burnham) – his victory should hardly have come as a surprise. A lot of the more lurid exaggerations about the changes to the party’s membership were really just cover for the embarrassment of those who had looked at a party with the same soft-left values it had always held, and failed to predict an entirely predictable thing.Which brings us to Momentum, which is bedevilled by similar myth-making. At around 40,000 members, the group is just under a tenth the size of the overall party – but a tenth would be ample if it were the revolutionary sect, hellbent on getting rid of opponents, that it’s often portrayed as. There are certainly constituency parties where this picture is correct, where Momentum members did pore over the rule book trying to deselect their MP.But there are also Momentum groups which are essentially Labour-plus, social and intellectual movements whose members run book groups and club nights as well as attending meetings. They cooperate perfectly well with the rest of the party, since their differences are of taste, not ideology. The idea that the party can’t take power again until these people are stamped out is simply fanciful. By what test would you eject them? “Your food bank fundraiser quiz night had too many questions on grime”?The view that the party’s composition has to change before it can learn from its mistakes remains fairly niche. Instead, the distortions tend to act as signposts in the leadership contest, all pointing in wild directions: the claim that the members, defined by blind loyalty, will only accept the continuity candidate or the members, guided by rigid principle, will only accept a woman or they will only take a northerner. Not only are these precepts wrong, they are also boring, seeking to reduce to a flow chart of predetermined loyalties what is actually a contest of ideas.The drive to portray Rebecca Long Bailey as the candidate of the authentic left, and Jess Phillips as the true centre, is more about power blocs than politics – a move to retain power by the existing inner circle on one side, and retake it by the pragmatists of yesteryear on the other. But the other candidates (Keir Starmer, Clive Lewis, Emily Thornberry and Lisa Nandy) are all giving versions of modern leftwing analysis that are genuinely different, and have the potential to coexist and cross-pollinate – because they are about ideas, not control.That’s the big distortion of this leadership election: the idea that it is dominated by bitter infighting and savage power play. In fact, having transparent debates about competing visions for the future, and then voting on them, is what keeps the party alive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67fd00fbf19f4f4015b08e45ecf812ad50a59224/0_12_1147_688/master/1147.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d204c9c7addd78b0f2cd087d233dc8f8","title":"guys ask for more money why female led startups underperform","story":"Male culture and lack of role models are stopping female academics from launching companies based on their researchThe first time Olivia Champion pitched a business idea based on her academic research was so disheartening she nearly gave up. The 10-strong panel she faced were all men, bar a few women responsible for administration and taking minutes. Their first question was: “Why are you here?”“It took the wind out of my sails immediately,” she says. “I thought, ‘Blimey. This is going badly.’”She had been convinced her idea was good, but after that rejection she began to doubt herself. “They were very dismissive,” she says. “And quite rude, to be frank.”After being encouraged by her university, Exeter, to give pitching one more try, Champion went on to secure all the investment she was seeking. Five years on, her company, BioSystems Technology, which sells insect larvae for scientific testing and reduces the need to experiment on mammals, is in profit.The research, part of a programme funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) looking at barriers to the participation of female scientists in university spinout companies, also found that women in decision-making positions were more likely to work in smaller spinouts – those with fewer than 25 employees – and that the more female founders a spinout company had, the less financial investment it tended to receive.Simonetta Manfredi, who is leading the research and is a professor of equality and ersity at Oxford Brookes, says this matters because university spinouts will soon become increasingly important, due to a government drive to force institutions to demonstrate the real-world impact of their research. “Spinouts produce jobs and can make a significant contribution to their local community,” she says.Politicians are also waking up to the importance of gender equality in this area. Last year, a government-commissioned review of female entrepreneurship found only one in three UK entrepreneurs were women, and argued that addressing this could boost the economy by £250bn,.But it is also about ensuring a more equal society Ana Avaliani, head of enterprise at the Royal Academy of Engineering, says: “The types of products women bring to tender are informed by their experience and knowledge so it is vital we encourage female entrepreneurs to bring that perspective.” But the picture is complex. There is much less disparity in the number of women studying physical sciences and more women than men studying biological sciences, yet female spinout representation here is still low.While spinouts are traditionally founded by academics in senior positions, Manfredi says there is no reason they cannot happen at other career stages. “The assumption that there are not enough female professors, so what can we do about it, is not true because there is a bigger pipeline there,” she says.Yet she concedes that the male culture in science can be a barrier, alongside a lack of female entrepreneur role models. Avaliani, who was part of the founding team of a startup company 20 years ago, says being the only female was intimidating.“There were about five men – all engineers, all super high-achievers - in the room for a team meeting, and just me,” she says. “Although I was never made to feel a lesser member of the team it felt weird.”While the founders of her startup were convinced of the benefits of ersity, she suggests this is not often the case and the pressure to make a profit can make managers unwilling to take hiring risks.The researchers are also investigating why female-led spinouts tend to receive less money. One suggestion is that it is because they ask for less. Champion says she was conscious that she was pitching for significantly less money than her male counterparts. “I stripped it all back to think, ‘What’s the absolute least I can ask for?’” she says.Time out of regular academic jobs to explore an idea would help potential female entrepreneurs, she adds. There is also evidence that women have less time for networking, which is an essential part of entrepreneurial success, so more opportunities for virtual networking could be useful.The next stage of the project, to be published in April, will look at whether men and women have different characteristics that may effect their involvement in spinouts, such as differences in self-confidence or willingness to take risks. If Champion could go back in time, she says she would tell herself to be more confident – and ask for more money. “The guys all ask for loads of money and get it,” she says.

After her speech at the Oxford Farming Conference, the hundreds of participants were asked to raise their hands if they were convinced that she would in fact protect their interests against trade partners, including the US. No hands were raised.Rob Percival, head of food and health policy at the Soil Association, said: “Villiers’s suggestion that tariffs could be placed on imports that don’t meet UK standards suggests the government is looking for ways to support UK farming, but such piecemeal measures need to be part of a coherent trade policy, which we are yet to see. This policy and the ensuing legislation must ensure non-regression on environment, food and farming standards, and ensure the UK can continue to raise the bar in response to the climate and nature emergency.”Villiers refused to back farmers’ demands for an independent trade commission that would rule on whether trade deals met the UK’s standards, but said she would relay their views to her government colleagues and a decision would be made.Mark Bridgeman, president of the Country Land and Business Association, which represents landowners and rural businesses, said farmers were also concerned about the transition to a new subsidy system. Under plans laid out by Villiers, farmers will be moved over the next seven years from payments based on the amount of land farmed to new subsidies based on agreements by farmers to provide environmental protections.Villers said these agreements would be made with inidual farmers based on their circumstances, which would be a huge undertaking, but provided few details of what would be involved.Farmers at the conference also heard about some of the problems with diets in Britain, including obesity and poor health caused by a poor diet. Healthy and environmentally sustainable food should be more widely and cheaply available, said Henry Dimbleby, co-founder of the Leon restaurant chain, who is leading the government’s national food strategy.Denise Bentley, founder of the First Love Foundation food bank charity, said the problems went much deeper than blaming people for making poor choices and that poverty was “the elephant in the room” because people simply could not afford healthier food.Campaigners want the government to make bigger interventions in the market for food, to ensure higher nutritional standards in food products. However, the food and drink industry is resistant to demands for greater regulation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d36ab2feebbdfa90e074679e1d3b99dfc41b8616/894_531_2513_1508/master/2513.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08baf09f6f2015c0e5bb09a1f6392f6e","title":"fashion top trend setter li edelkoort futurologist perfect clothes 2020s","story":"When Lidewij – or Li – Edelkoort started her career as a trend forecaster 45 years ago, people thought her job was “witchcraft”, she says. “Men would be giggling at the end of the room. But I have gained respect,” she says, “because I have been right so many times.”The Dutch 69-year-old is fashion’s best-known soothsayer, a woman who has spent more than four decades helping brands, including Prada, Zara and Coca-Cola, to anticipate customer desire. She is also the dean of hybrid design studies for the prestigious New York fashion college Parsons School of Design, a curator (one recent exhibition was an installation in Tokyo in which Google devices were placed among artisanal homeware), and a regular on “most influential people” lists in fashion and design.When we meet, she is swathed in loose, dark layers of Escada and Issey Miyake, and has just delivered a lecture to a rapt audience of 100 fashion and retail buyers in London. With striking hair (a dark bob with Lily Munster streaks) and thick black spectacles, she speaks slowly, in very long sentences: interviewing her can feel like consulting a very niche psychic. She is given to issuing prophecies such as: “I think we will get very inspired by blouses.”But while it is fun to imagine her as the Nostradamus of fast-moving consumer goods, her methods are relatively down to earth. Through research, interviews and travel, she picks up ideas that are “circling around”, then uses her “intuition” (“data is no use it’s too late,” she says wearily) to predict which of them will take off.She has never made a bad call, she says, not least because her predictions “are not my invention”. “I’m just picking it up and broadcasting it. It is not a creative profession. It is more analytic.” What she will admit to is occasionally miscalculating the “volume” of a trend. After seeing leggings on New York City messengers at the end of the 80s, for example, “I thought, that’s cool – it will be a trend. Little did I know it would become a billion-dollar business.”For at least 10 years, she says, trends have slowed down, becoming “vast currents which are mobilised over time”. This makes me feel a bit basic, when I then ask for assurances about whether the midi skirt I’m wearing will still be fashionable in 2025. “That idea left us somewhere in the 80s,” she says drily. “Everyone can have the length they desire.”Edelkoort has, in fact, gone further than this. In 2015, she predicted the death of the fashion industry as we know it, slamming it as “a ridiculous and pathetic parody” in a treatise titled the Anti_Fashion Manifesto. Last year, she wrote a similarly damning appraisal of the Met Gala, calling the red carpet a “mesmerising and sickening” display, which came on “the same day the UN published a scientific survey that certified that because of human greed, excess, waste and abuse of our habitat we will lose one million species”.She was so angry when she wrote that, she said, that “I didn’t even recognise myself,” yet these moments of truth-telling made her more popular. “When I made the manifesto, I could have lost all my clients – I took a risk. But the timing was right. People sent me messages saying: ‘This is what we all think!’” Anyway, Edelkoort says, you only have to look at the closures of blue-chip brands such as Barneys to see that people are sick of fashion as usual. “It is no longer attractive for people to encounter the same old thing on every street corner. The consumer doesn’t see the point any more,” she says. “Wake up, people!”After our interview, she presents a second lecture, the latest of her big predictions, titled The Future of Luxury. She argues that in the next decade – as people tire of overconsumption – our lives will shift radically. She urges the assembled fashion professionals to “make much less, make it better and make it more expensive”. She says that success will not be expressed in dollars but “in degrees of happiness”.“People are an endangered species and if you’re not part of the big change you’re not relevant,” she tells me afterwards. Many brands, she argues, will close if they don’t change. “It’s very hard to turn these big boats around,” she says. “It’s much easier to start a new company now than scale down.”Despite Boris Johnson’s recent election – and regardless of the presence of a climate-change denier in the Oval Office – she believes young people will continue to fight for a better future, and will get one. “Crazily enough, elections everywhere in the world go against it,” she says, but she believes the hunger for a greener, fairer, less consumerist society is growing and that eventually there will be a tipping point.“In Germany and parts of China, there is an increasing understanding that ecology equals economy. The day we are able to prove this, I think we will create change.” Witchcraft or otherwise, here’s hoping she is right.LibrariesLibraries will “start lending clothes, offering lectures and writing courses, hosting exhibitions and concerts”, says Edelkoort. She believes they will become “the epicentres of small towns and villages”, partly run by community volunteers in return for access. In Tokyo, she says, there are already “beautiful” libraries where people work and dine together. She believes this will be one of many “societal initiatives bringing us back together”, in response to today’s “dangerous” state of disconnection.Our eye for colour will change as natural dyes – such as those made from onions and avocados – become mainstream. Their colours are less saturated, “more subdued and melancholic”. Similarly, more sustainable fabrics, such as those made from nettle and algae, will become popular.‘Non-fashion’ fashionEdelkoort believes “proven, functional” workwear shapes will be popular in the 2020s. “We will retreat, after all this newness, possibly into something more sensible and pragmatic,” she says.There will still be “a need for romantic dresses – slightly high-waisted a need for volume.” Edelkoort cites the Irish designer Simone Rocha as someone who is “now getting major acclaim”. That silhouette is, she says, “beguiling” and encourages “a more dancing step”.Flight shamingIn the next decade, we will fly a tenth as much as we do today, says Edelkoort. In Scandinavian countries, she says, wealthy people are already selling their houses abroad rather than face their friends’ disapproval at their regular flying. Recently, KLM advised customers to fly less. Train travel, she believes, will take off instead. She argues that this will happen because “the big innovative companies, like Google, Tesla and Apple” will invest in green technology, while some companies will rethink their business plans in a radical way. KLM and British Airways, for example, “would be smart” to invest in the rail sector to make up for the shortfall in domestic flights.An age of collaborationIn fashion and design, “there will be co-creation. One of my visions of the future is that it will be the age of the amateur people will be empowered to be more creative.”The end of ‘stuffocation’Edelkoort cites the popularity of shows on Netflix about decluttering as a sign that citizens will soon buy into the “revelation” that having less stuff will make us happier. She believes that people will grow to cherish their selected possessions so deeply that we will eventually see the rise of animism, where objects are respected, treated “like pets”. “This is a bit further in time,” she says, “but it will definitely happen.”• This article was corrected on 8 January 2020.

For reasons you could never hope to understand, Mercedes recently unveiled the Vision AVTR, a concept car that has been directly inspired by the decade-old film. As part of the company’s Ambition 2039 initiative, which aims to make Mercedes “the most loved sustainable modern luxury automotive brand in the market”, the Vision AVTR was designed to show what driving will be like in the distant future.Which you already know, because we’ll have had 30 years of driverless cars before the sea rises and the land is lost and whatever brittle scraps of humanity remain will be forced to drift around the planet on handmade rafts drinking their own urine like Kevin Costner in Waterworld. But Mercedes has a different idea. Mercedes apparently thinks that we’ll not only remain alive, but we’ll also be desperate to drive cars that look like a Mars Bar you’ve been carrying around in your back pocket all day.Maybe I’m doing the car an injustice. Let’s hear what Mercedes’ Steffen Köhl had to say about the car: “There is a universe of shapes and creatures from the film’s universe that provoked us when we thought about the vehicle’s design. The spiral repeating lines from the Na’vi reflect the illumination of the multifunctional control element in the centre console that allows human and machine to merge.”The centre console of the Vision AVTR seems to be the most important part of the car. Remember how in Avatar the blue people had to plug their hair into animals and each other if they wanted to go anywhere or experience sexual joy? The centre console is the car’s equivalent to that.But there’s more. Köhl added: “The 33 bionic flaps on the back of the vehicle are reminiscent of scales from the dinosaur-like creatures from the film, and they move and breathe and live.”But whatever you think of the car – which will almost certainly be “urgh” – you have to admit it’s a canny way to ramp up publicity for next year’s Avatar sequel. After all, Avatar was a film with a strong ecological message about how capitalism’s destruction of the environment caused unknowable physical and spiritual pain to those who lived in it. And Mercedes-Benz makes cars, which are one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. That works, right…? No? Well, look, it’s either this or napkins. And the napkins are all sold out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32c1ad5d6893a141f13cd1bf06020b2d2ad4261f/0_153_5897_3538/master/5897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0e40291da114942bc4c780c9ae93229","title":"zlatan ibrahimovic statue vandalised","story":"The Milan striker’s Malmö monument cannot at present last more than a few days without being vandalised. But why? And by whom?Without wishing to go in hard with an exhaustive history of Swedish iconoclasm, holy artefacts have had a comparatively good time of it in that Scandinavian nation. Not too many wars on home soil has helped, as did the fact the Lutheran reformation wasn’t systematically iconoclastic in Sweden. Nothing lasts forever, alas – which brings us to the statue of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, a monument which cannot at present last more than a few days without being vandalised.Located outside the Malmö FF stadium, in the town where Zlatan grew up, this reverential three-metre erection has been in situ since October last year. Alas, it was taken down from its plinth on Sunday after its latest run-in with sectarian despoilers. I say taken down – but in fact, the statue was already supine, having been sawn off at the ankles, and daubed with the instruction “take away”. And those are just the most recent abuses visited upon its 500 kilograms of bronze. These have included unsolicited rhinoplasty, the use of fireworks, silver paint, white paint, graffiti, the removal of a single toe (very Big Lebowski) and the amputation of one leg below the knee. I imagine Rafael van der Vaart sent flowers.All told, the “Vandalism” section of the Zlatan statue’s dedicated Wikipedia entry is fast becoming one of my favourite sporting subheadings. One day it may even rival the “Personal Life” section of Nick Faldo’s entry. (Enjoy – though I will just take this opportunity to pass on his second wife’s deathless quote: “Socially, he was a 24-handicapper.”)Is the latest horror tackle likely to be career-ending for the Ibrahimovic statue? That remains unclear. Officially, it is in for repairs, though at this rate of degeneration it is difficult to see how it can keep realistically rising again. Perhaps they could do something for it at one of the Italian clubs, with their special gyms and so on.Needless to say, meanwhile, desecration of statues happens in contemporary societies for a variety of reasons. News cuttings for the very day on which the Zlatan statue was removed reveal that a Gandhi statue in Gujarat was also vandalised. Though the Indian independence leader is widely accepted to be a less significant cultural figure than the current Milan striker, I am sure Zlatan would take comfort from the fact that this sort of impudence is also happening lower down the international statuary leagues.As for the trigger of the Ibrahimovic statue’s ongoing woes, it seems to go beyond matters of mere style and taste. After all, the Zlatan rendition is relatively lifelike and aesthetically inoffensive compared with many notable modern football statues, which aim to make even the heavily disguised waxworks of Madame Tussauds look like those they are apparently supposed to resemble. Players insulted in bronze of late include Cristiano Ronaldo, of whom a comically misshapen image was unveiled at Madeira airport, and Mo Salah, who has for some reason been immortalised as a sort of homunculus Art Garfunkel in his hometown.Given that Zlatan is presented as arrogantly shirtless in his statue, you could really only fault the medium for its inability to replicate the subject’s body art. You can’t do tattoos in bronze. (Even so, let’s take a moment to agree that the “Only God Can Judge Me” tattoo – sported by Zlatan and countless other true originals – is one of the absolute cast-iron signs you’re in the presence of a certain type. On the off-chance there is a heaven, I imagine it would contain a vast daily queue of people waiting for God to judge their Only God Can Judge Me tattoos. The Almighty’s verdict would be communicated by a bored angel, going: “Cliched, lame, and only acceptable on Tupac. Otherwise, one of the leading international signs of the shit. Could the next tattooee step forward to the celestial throne, please!”)No, in terms of motive, the Zlatan tale is thought to fall strictly into the damnatio memoriae – condemnation of memory – category, which saw statues of Lenin and so on purged across former Soviet territories. Zlatan’s offence has been to buy a large stake in Malmö’s rivals, Hammarby, and promise to make them “the best in Scandinavia”.That said, I am extremely open to other theories. One of mine is that the Zlatan statue is involved in some kind of modern realisation of the Oscar Wilde story The Happy Prince. Did you ever read this one? Basically there’s a statue of a prince in a poor town, and the prince can’t bear to see the suffering, so with the help of a swallow, he sacrifices bits of himself – a sapphire eye, some surface gilding, and so on – to alleviate poverty. So this, but with a footballer’s bronze nose, toe, and lower leg. Is Malmö being regenerated via these valuable Zlatan relics? We daren’t rule it out.Speaking of ruling things out, perhaps all this has the distinct air of a dark Scandi crime drama. It’s not just that celebrated show The Bridge is set partly in Malmö – more that there have now been series of grotesque attacks, which presumably someone will have to solve. A review of the evidence sparks my own hunch. Broken legs, broken noses, a little serial ultraviolence – is the villain’s MO not redolent of man whose own arsenal of threats and injurings was famously vast and baroque? Think about it. Who, in all honesty, could inflict this amount of damage on the Zlatan statue other than … Zlatan Ibrahimovic himself? Far be it from me to give pointers to the Malmö police department – but could there yet be the ultimate twist in this tale?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d80cba42f0028b64b7007f67104e7305ede563d/0_303_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a32d848ea2e5b3594ad2777d84ab02d","title":"it takes a thick skin to rock a bald head meet the women embracing hair loss","story":"Society often associates femininity with long, flowing locks – but a growing number of women are choosing to celebrate their baldnessBarbara Williams didn’t get married just to change her name – of course not. But the opportunity to have a new surname was certainly an attractive proposition. Williams has had trichotillomania, a condition that causes her to pull out her hair compulsively, since she was nine – and her original name was Balde. Well, it wasn’t ideal.A 63-year-old picture framer from Warwickshire, Williams believes that her trichotillomania was triggered by the stress of her mother leaving the family home. She would lie awake at night and tug out great handfuls of hair, before rolling it up into a ball and hiding it behind the bed. By her 30s, she was totally bald. “It was just awful,” she sighs. “I couldn’t even watch shampoo adverts on the television. There would be a horrible feeling in my chest.”She wore wigs, but found them hot and uncomfortable. Then, when she turned 50, Williams decided: enough. She would be open with people about her condition and they could take her as they found her. “I felt dirty and like I would be rejected,” she says. “In fact, when I started telling people, it was a fantastic relief, like a great weight had been taken off my shoulders.”Williams is far from the only woman to embrace her baldness. The US talkshow host Ricki Lake recently went public with her 30-year struggle with hair loss, explaining that her hair started falling out when she appeared in the 1988 film Hairspray. “There have been a few times where I have even felt suicidal over it,” she wrote in a heartfelt Facebook post. “Almost no one in my life knew the level of deep pain and trauma I was experiencing.” Lake wore hair extensions, but the process of having them fitted was expensive, time-consuming and painful. She has decided to stop wearing extensions or wigs. “I am so done with hiding,” Lake wrote.Other celebrities have spoken out about female hair loss. The British TV presenter and 90s lads’ mags regular Gail Porter was diagnosed with alopecia in her 30s and has talked about her experience openly. After winning gold at the London Olympics in 2012, the cyclist Joanna Rowsell Shand, who also has alopecia, appeared on the podium jubilant and bald.Lake, Porter and Rowsell Shand are high-profile advocates for the growing number of women choosing to accept their baldness, rather than hiding or disguising it. “Wigs have been a massive hindrance,” says Alice Austin, a 32-year-old social worker from Nottingham. She started losing her hair due to alopecia when she was in primary school. By nine, Austin’s hair had fallen out so much that she started wearing wigs to school. “They were these horrendously thick NHS wigs,” she remembers. “The kids would call me ‘Wiggy’.”In secondary school, a boy pulled off Austin’s wig as she was walking up a flight of stairs. When Austin played netball, students would chant “Wiggy wiggy wiggy”. “It was traumatic for me, because how you look is so important when you’re a teenager,” she says. “It massively knocked my confidence.” She says wearing a wig is not fun: your scalp itches, sudden bursts of wind induce terror – and you can forget about swimming in the sea on holiday.Motherhood changed things for Austin. “I turned 30 and thought: I have to get a grip on myself,” Austin says. “I’m a mum. Kids are so perceptive.” She stopped wearing her wig as often, deciding to play netball without it, or to do the school run bald. In summer, when the weather is warm, Austin hardly ever wears her wig. “I could never have done that before,” she says. Last year, for the first time, she didn’t renew her NHS wig prescription.Female hair loss can happen for a variety of reasons. “The most common reason is a disturbance in the hair cycle,” says Dr David Fenton, a London-based dermatologist and spokesman for the British Association of Dermatologists. “More follicles enter the resting phase as a reaction to something that’s happened in your life, whether it’s fever, weight loss, illness, stress or thyroid dysfunction.” This condition is called telogen effluvium. “As long as you can identify the reason for telogen effluvium, it usually grows back,” says Fenton. “Occasionally, it will precipitate the female equivalent of genetic hair loss, which will require long-term therapy to prevent you losing more hair.”Women can also experience hair loss due to hormone changes after the menopause, or if they have polycystic ovarian syndrome. In this instance, doctors may prescribe antiandrogen contraceptives, which block the excessive production of male sex hormones in the body, which is known to cause hair loss. Alopecia occurs when the body’s immune system goes into overdrive and begins targeting hair follicles in error.Black women who wear braids may also experience traction alopecia, which is hair loss caused by very tight hairstyles. Doctors can help minimise hair loss – minoxidil solution, sold commercially as Regaine lotion, is an effective over-the-counter solution for alopecia – but they can’t prevent alopecia attacks coming on. “Alopecia can be very upsetting, because it happens so suddenly,” says Fenton. “One week you have hair, then in a few weeks you can be bald. Attacks may flare up suddenly. Every time it happens, the person grieves.”Hair loss is particularly devastating for women, as femininity in western cultures is typically associated with long, flowing hair. “You can’t overestimate the social, emotional and psychological effects of hair loss on a woman, particularly if that person’s hair has been a major feature of their appearance,” says Fenton.Christala Fletcher, who is 27 and from west London, has alopecia. She decided to shave her head when she was 19, after experiencing near-total hair loss. “It’s a mess, being a bald woman in our society,” she says. “People judge women without hair. Hair is so important in the media. It’s supposedly what makes you a woman.”Accepting your baldness in a society that connotes hair with femininity is cathartic. “Before, I felt like the wig dictated to me, as if I had to wear it whether I wanted to or not,” says Austin. “Now, I feel like I have a choice. I’d been stripped of that for so long.” But it may take years – and loving support – to get to a place where you are comfortable going bald in public. Many women find that online communities can be an important source of affirmation: Alopecia UK has a popular Facebook group, while there are forums for people with trichotillomania, too.The decision to shave what is left of your hair can feel momentous. “It was really tough,” says Fletcher of her decision to shave her head. Her sister helped her get through it. “She got the razor and said: ‘Let’s do this together.’ I had this patch of hair on the top of my head that I’d been holding on to so deeply.”But going out in public bald is often an anticlimax. “It was less scary than I thought,” says Juliet Fitzpatrick, a 55-year-old admin worker from Hertfordshire. After being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016, Fitzpatrick’s hair fell out due to chemotherapy. She decided to eschew wigs or headwraps. “For me, wearing a wig didn’t feel right. It felt like a pretence, like I was covering something up.”When her children graduated from university, Fitzpatrick asked them if they wanted her to wear a wig. They said no. “I said: ‘That’s good, because I don’t want to wear one!’” Going bald felt empowering. “I needed something positive to come out of this horrible experience for me, it was not wearing a wig and just being who I was at that particular point in my life.”Most of the time, going wig-free in public is a positive experience. “People are much kinder than you think,” says Austin. “When you’ve been bullied as a child, you think all people are nasty, mean and horrible, but people are much more understanding than you realise.” That said, well-intentioned strangers tend to assume that, if you are bald, you have cancer. “I always felt that people felt sorry for me because they thought I had cancer,” says Williams. “I was getting sympathy I didn’t deserve.”But not everyone is understanding. “It takes a person with thick skin to rock a bald head proudly,” Fletcher says. And there are situations in which being a bald woman can be stressful. Williams hates going to public toilets, because she worries that she will be mistaken for a man. “I’ll come out of a cubicle and women will do a double-take, or women walk into the bathroom and they’re not sure if they’ve accidentally walked into the gents.”Recently, Austin was on holiday in Cyprus for a friend’s wedding. “It was the first time I’d really embraced the alopecia,” she says. “I was walking around the pool without a headscarf on, and this mother of a little girl came up to me and burst into tears. She told me that her daughter had started losing her hair the year before and she didn’t know what to do.”Austin hopes for a relaxing of traditional beauty standards, so that by the time that girl has grown up being bald won’t be so unusual. “I think we’re seeing more people in the public eye who are different,” Austin says. “Our definitions of what is beautiful are changing. Women can be beautiful without hair.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ccfaf760ec878247a3af49c97fd61a9792e68d8/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87477c5c73f628d3939dddf990d80a03","title":"tell us about outstanding customer service you received","story":"We want to hear from people who have received exceptional customer serviceAfter the Christmas spending flurry come the tales of corporate ill will, with botched delivery dates, faulty goods and customer service departments who don’t seem to listen or care.At this time of year, ’s consumer inboxes are congested with high street horror stories.Invisible in the background, some firms are going beyond the call of duty to fulfil orders and resolve issues.Often independent companies and occasionally big chains, handle complaints with care and respect, creating a better impression of themselves in the minds of their customers.We want to hear from people who have been bowled over by exceptional service, to show that corporate Britain can sometimes get it right.Has a trader driven through the night to ensure your goods reach you in time or soothed a situation with imaginative aplomb?Tell us about your experiences in the form below – one of our journalists may be in touch to discuss further and we’ll publish a selection as part of an upcoming feature.If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.

One theory is that stronger price gains signal a Boris bounce. “The electoral polling was largely one-sided by early December, so some buyers may have decided to push through transactions by accepting higher prices, ahead of what they expected to be tighter housing market conditions after a Conservative win.”“At the very least, even if house price growth did accelerate at the end of 2019, the Halifax index seems to be overstating this gain.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6b1f81b9dc7134efb78d2fd7781ed61938d8c55/12_0_1132_679/master/1132.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3830943b3480241a49f12cf322769cfa","title":"musical notes justin bieber tiktok friendly yummy too eager to go viral","story":"’s new monthly column gathers all the ideas, trends and other musical flotsam that slips through the cultural net. Share your own thoughts on the month in music, and we’ll feature some next monthPop and rock music, in its multifarious forms, seems to shift faster than ever. In 2020, we’re bombarded not just with music – more of which is readily available to everyone than at any point in history – but an unrelenting barrage of the stuff that goes along with music: visuals, scenes, theories, arguments, counter-arguments and controversies both real and manufactured. It can feel overwhelming, impossible for even the most plugged-in, social media-literate listener to keep up with. No matter how much of the waterfront you try to cover, it’s hard to rid yourself of the nagging sensation that you might have missed out on something.That’s as true of us in the music media as it is of any other listener. The idea behind the ’s new monthly Musical Notes column is to collect a miscellany of smaller ideas, thoughts, experiences and trends about music: stuff that’s interesting, striking or telling, but doesn’t necessarily fit within the ’s standard feature, review or news formats. I’ll be contributing each month along with music editors Ben Beaumont-Thomas and Laura Snapes – but we also want to include you, too. Share your thoughts, ideas and experiences about any genre of music each month in the comments section – be it a song or gig you’ve loved, a trend you’ve spotted, or indeed anything musical that piqued your interest – and we’ll publish a selection of them in the following month’s column. For now, here’s Ben and Laura to kick off the series with what they’ve been reflecting on in the first week of 2020. Alexis PetridisJustin Bieber’s previous album, 2015’s Purpose, was a triumphant third act: not only did it draw a line under years of juvenile delinquency (drugs, racist jokes, negligence to a pet monkey), it did so with the best songs of his career: the earnest and feathery reggaeton of Sorry, the beautiful trop-house of What Do You Mean, and Where Are Ü Now with its weird, faraway “dolphin flute”. After finding God and getting married, the stage is now set for the next Bieber story, and its opening chapter is a song called Yummy.Released last week, there are some things to like about it – the way the melody bounces up into the lovely, yearning upper range of his voice the opalescent chords – but there are plenty more to hate. The shameless plug for his streetwear brand Drew House the cringeworthy use of trap ebonics (“hundred racks … get litty babe”) the sense of him being about two years behind the curve of hazy R\u0026ampB, a real shame when Purpose was so trendsetting. But most of all, that chorus, which sounds like a Lonely Island parody of a pop-R\u0026ampB song. Its use of baby talk to vaguely gesture at a world of sexual pleasure will make your genitals involuntarily fold up inside your abdomen.More troubling than the vision of he and his wife cooing this at each other is the feeling that this has been written for one thing in mind: TikTok. Bieber joined the lipsyncing social network on the day of Yummy’s release, and its chorus seems designed purely for Gen Z-ers in yoga pants to spoon frozen acai into their mouths while miming along to the word “yummy”.Hit songs such as Regard’s Ride It, Ashnikko’s Stupid, and Arizona Zervas’s Roxanne have all recently got a boost from going viral in TikTok dance or mime videos, and this is what Bieber is trying to leverage – but the crucial difference is those tracks are, respectively, more danceable, witty and tuneful. The deeper problem is that a generation grown on highly sophisticated, multilayered internet culture can detect bullshit a mile off: this is so nakedly eager to go viral that it almost certainly won’t.Yummy will probably reach No 1 off Bieber’s sheer star power anyway. He doesn’t need the TikTok virality, but craves its pop-cultural relevance – and that desperation chafes awkwardly against the spiritually grounded marital bliss of his current image. Ben Beaumont-ThomasI hated iPods. Certain kids at school had them the moment they were released in 2001, storing the pitiful four albums they owned on an expensive device designed to hold 1,000 songs. I was 12 and already fancied myself a serious music fan: I had at least, like, 20 albums. iPods, it was obvious, were for posers. Once I got a Saturday job, I saved up for a hardy brick called an iRiver that also held photos and a radio tuner, and wheezed like a geriatric mouse when I laboriously clicked through a music collection largely comprising Tegan and Sara bootlegs downloaded via a dial-up modem. My insistence that it was clearly the better MP3 player was undermined by the fact that absolutely nobody else had one.As my iRiver struggled on, the iPod got sleeker, and its capacity considerably bigger. In 2007, Apple introduced a 160GB Classic model. I could no longer resist. (Plus I had left school so there was no risk of anyone saying “I told you so”.) I loved it like a pet, updating it and labelling my iTunes library obsessively. I have fond, tragic memories of listening to Mogwai’s Young Team on it as I traipsed through the rain to read Kafka in a Starbucks during my first year of university listening to the National and feeling sorry for myself alone on a Friday night in my grotty first London house share. More happily, I took it around the world, and the increasingly scratched iPod seemed to grow with me: any time I scrolled to see if an artist I wanted to discover was on there, somehow they always were. (The reality was thanks to a uni friend letting me copy her extensive and largely pirated music library.)As the 2010s wore on, my iPod’s packed 160GB capacity was no match for the infinite library of Spotify, which I initially tried to use only to research old albums for work. Apple retired the iPod Classic, then they nuked the headphone jack from their phones. As carrying an iPod with its wired headphones and MP3 dependence became more anachronistic, I clung to it, particularly as a form of resistance against distraction – iPod Classics don’t connect to wifi or contain apps, or stop playing when a marketer calls you. That mine still worked – albeit now very dented and prone to pausing at the faintest jolt – felt vaguely meaningful.But gradually, I succumbed to Spotify creep. I got into exercise, where carrying one device, a phone, is easier than two, and wireless headphones help. (Better still if that device contains Twitter for distraction from squats.) I got into podcasts, which live on my phone. When I got an office job and started commuting, I found that my iPod and wired headphones stayed in my bag as I switched from NPR’s Fresh Air to Spotify, or the brilliant Bandcamp app, to soundtrack my train reading. I got a phone with more space and (embarrassingly) finally figured out how to put MP3s on it.As of 2020, I’ve stopped carrying my iPod around. I feel so guilty at seeing it on the shelf, that I abandoned it before it died. It’s so feeble to think that the lightest grazes of friction pushed me away from my beloved little music machine. Though maybe it’s more than just convenience. Fifteen years ago, it seemed so thrilling to have thousands of songs in your pocket, the world at your fingertips. With time, I’ve understood that all that access generally amounts to a lot of dabbling and not much commitment. Obviously, Spotify offers the same possibility, but I keep a judicious eye on the albums I save to it, discarding duds and eventually purchasing the good ones while MP3s still exist.My iTunes library is still intact, an MP3 monolith built on varying degrees of legitimacy that I can pluck from at any time. (You want an illicit recording of the National playing a French radio session in 2006? I got you.) I don’t want to carry it around in my pocket any more, but the slippery way that streaming companies seduce consumers into abandoning their libraries, and the equally slippery way that songs can then vanish from the world’s library (whether the internet or actual, physical warehouses) makes holding on to them, whatever the device, feel like a meaningful form of resistance.

But when it comes to exciting locations to run some happy miles, there are few cities that squeeze in so much scenery, greenery and variety as Bristol. And if you enjoy splitting your time between tarmac and trails, this hilly beast of a city offers the perfect mix – with enough ups, downs and testing terrain to challenge the bravest and the fittest.With access to expansive parks and estate grounds, trails for off-road adventuring, fantastic river paths and even quad-burning towers to climb, this gateway to the West Country has become my personal running mecca. If you fancy checking it out for yourself, here are my highlights.Blaise Castle quad burnerWith free parking, a handy cafe and 260 hectares (650 acres) of parkland to explore, the Blaise Castle Estate is a wonderful – but challenging – place to lose yourself on a longer run. The grounds mix steep, groomed woodland paths with rockier trail-style climbs and descents, providing plenty to test your footwork and work your quads. The single-track woodland trails along Hazel brook make you feel like you’ve been magically whisked far from the city. For the best views – and a harder hill run – make a beeline for the 18th-century folly castle that looks down over the estate. I personally love letting loose on the way back down, putting the grip of shoes like the New Balance Fresh Foam X Hierro V5 to work.Ladies Mile intervalsA wonderful road that cuts through the green open space of Clifton Down, Ladies Mile is a flat stretch of Bristol that’s hugely popular with runners who want to escape the busier city streets. Join at Westbury Road and run through Durdham Down, for a 2-mile (3km) almost-unbroken stretch that’s perfectly punctuated with trees every 20m and shouldered on both sides by big expanses of green. You can choose to run the pavements but if you’re in a versatile road-to-trail shoe with decent grip, I recommend stepping on to the softer paths naturally worn out of the park to add a little extra difficulty – and fun. Those trees are perfect for speedy intervals and once you’re done it’s easy to swing back on to the down for some stunning easy recovery – or run on to the Clifton Observatory.Over and under the Clifton Suspension BridgeA short hop from Ladies Mile is a stunning loop that takes in Bristol’s most famous landmark – Isambard Kingdom Brunel’s Clifton Suspension Bridge. Run the Promenade and slip past the Clifton Observatory en route to the 150-year-old marvel of engineering. To get the maximum experience, run across the bridge and soak up the dizzying views of the gorge and the River Avon below. Then loop down riverside via the steep, muddy trails through Leigh Woods on either side, and run along the flat, groomed compact mud of the Avon Trail for another perspective on this incredible setting.Ashton Court Estate loopIt’s not hard to see why this Grade II* landscape, with 345 hectares (850 acres) of woodland, is one of the UK’s most popular. Set around a grand mansion house, its rolling terrain offers a winning combination of tarmac roads, hilly running trails across huge clearings and through enclosed woodland. The tree-lined driveway into the estate on a bright autumn or winter day is a real treat. I relish the challenge of burning my quads climbing the softer, grassier hills. When the work is done, you’re treated to stunning views over Bristol and surrounding countryside. There’s parking and a lovely cafe for essential post-run refuelling, too.Cabot Tower climbCabot Tower is set in the heart of Brandon Hill Park, itself a great city centre location for short looping runs with a healthy serving of hills. But if you’re looking for an alternative quick HIIT (high-intensity interval training) session, then you could try sprinting up the 108 steps of the tower. The stairs are steep and narrow so you need shoes you can trust to be sure-footed but the 360-degree views over Bristol are worth the effort. It’s open from 8.15am to 6.15pm all year round but this is a tourist hotspot so very early mornings are the best time to come.Troopers Hill marchIf you want somewhere to tackle short-but-sharp, off-road hill repeats, Troopers Hill ticks that box. Enter the nature reserve from the entrance on Troopers Hill Road and you can “enjoy” a 60m trail climb up to the tower. The mainly mud path up is stepped in parts to make it more of a challenge and each time you conquer the hill, the pay-off is a great view back down across Bristol. While you’re here, you can also explore the trails through Troopers Hill Woods.Vale Street sufferfestIn April 2019, the Ordinance Survey officially declared Vale Street a hill. Which might sound blindingly obvious when you first set eyes on the steepest street in England. With a 22-degree gradient in a 60m asphalt climb, it’s like a very short section of a mountain in disguise and, in running terms, it’s the ultimate hill reps challenge. Unlike a mountain, however, there’s nothing picturesque about this residential street to distract from the pain – so running up it isn’t for the faint-hearted. Or the unfit.Banksy Street art strollBristol’s green spaces and woodland trails are great but when you’re done tackling trails, as the spiritual home of UK street art and of course Banksy, the city’s urban roads also offer plenty of visual treats to keep you running and exploring too. The perfect way to test out the Hierro’s soft, cushioned ride, it’s easy to stitch together your very own running street-art tour. For a cultural 5K, start in Bedminster and pick your way past Banksy’s Well Hung Lover on Frogmore Street and the Girl with the Pierced Eardrum on Hanover Place before heading to the Bear Pit skatepark and exploring the streets of Stokes Croft and St Pauls.The Fresh Foam X Hierro v5 is designed to go the distance.

We always discover somewhere new, because if there’s anything Londoners can bank on in this mighty city, it’s plenty of wonderful places and trails to run – all offering an assortment of terrain, from knobbly hills to the smoothest footpaths.Ready? Get set, go ...Richmond ParkThe chance to watch deer roaming free is the usual draw of Richmond Park – a certified national nature reserve. Covering almost 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres), it is the largest royal park in London and feels like you’re stepping into a whole new world, especially if you hit the Tamsin Trail. At just over 7 miles (11 km), this well-trodden, gravelly path offers the kind of adventurous landscape that’ll convert even the most committed urban runner to the trail life. You get to enter the wild through woods and fields, and up a few moderate ascents.There are cafes and water fountains along the way if you’re using this as a long run and need a breather – or ert into the park’s woodland garden Isabella Plantation so you can stop and smell the flowers.South Bank and Victoria Embankment loopThis swift jaunt around the Thames reminds me why I call London home. I like to time a run early enough to avoid the tourists, who love the South Bank in particular. For a 5K loop, start at Blackfriars station, run south over the bridge, take a right on Upper Ground, then take another a quick right on to Marigold Alley. You’ll hit the riverside, so turn left to follow the Thames and you’ll get to tread along a flat path as you fly past Oxo Tower, the National Theatre and the surprisingly sandy beaches you can spot at low tide near the Royal Festival Hall. You’ll also catch the bright lights of the London Eye, before climbing the steps on to Westminster Bridge. Turn right under Big Ben so you are now going eastwards on the north bank of the Thames along Victoria Embankment. Stay on the riverside pavement, so you don’t have to stop to cross roads and you can enjoy the great views of the Thames and the City beyond. Check out Cleopatra’s Needle and – on the left – Somerset House, before crossing over the road at Temple station. Continue along the Embankment before finishing up at the peaceful Middle Temple Gardens.Hampstead HeathSimilar to Richmond Park, Hampstead Heath is a leafy, countryside-esque destination that offers escapism from the bustle of the city – but it’s especially my go-to when I’m in the mood to tackle some ruthless hills or to get a bit muddy on the heath’s countless trails. For an obstacle-filled adventure, I like to start from Hampstead Heath overground station, and venture into the heath from South End Road. Follow the path and you’ll soon spot Hampstead No 1 and No 2 ponds – in the summer, you might even be tempted to have a dip. Keep going until you see the path that runs between the No 2 pond and the mixed bathing pond the terrain will become wilder as you start to make the taxing ascent to Parliament Hill. Catch your breath as you take in an impressive view of the capital – you should be able to make out the Gherkin, the Shard and St Pauls Cathedral in the distance. I might do a few hill reps here, then seek out the stunning Hill Garden and Pergola, a hidden gem on the west side of the heath.Victoria ParkLike many runners in east London, I’m a massive fan of Victoria Park. From its vast fields and leafy avenues to the top-notch cafes and restored bandstand, Bonner Bridge, the Burdett Coutts fountain and new play areas, London’s oldest park is still going strong. The terrain’s also nice and flat, which makes knocking out a speedy run such a pleasure. Made up of two parts split by Grove Road, a full lap of the park covers just over 4km (2.7 miles) – but if you have more in your legs, slip on to the Hertford Union canal for eclectic scenes of street art and houseboats as you make your way towards the Lee Navigation. For another change of scenery, you can peel off towards the Olympic Park en route for a calisthenics gym and art installations commemorating the legacy of the 2012 Olympics.Tower Bridge to Islands Gardens via the Thames PathThe London leg of the Thames Path, a pleasant national trail that follows the river, is 79.5 miles (128km) that’s usually tackled in four sections either north or south of the water. Though the entire route is a beaut, the 5-mile (8km) passage from Tower Bridge to Island Gardens is particularly fascinating. The first time I ran along it, I was riveted by how it unveiled the capital’s Victorian past. You’ll head through St Katherine’s Dock and Wapping along cobbled lanes, fly past Execution Dock where pirates were once hung, and be tempted to swing by the Prospect of Whitby pub, once frequented by Charles Dickens. From here, you’ll soon notice how the capital has evolved as you make your way through Limehouse, the glass and steel of Canary Wharf and eventually Island Gardens, where the multi-surface path officially ends.Crystal Palace ParkThe ladies from the Fly Girl Collective ran their first ever race here, so it’ll always be remembered as “very, very hard” – but in a good way. The mixed, hilly terrain of this south-east London park is one of the reasons why it’s a big hit with trail-loving runners. It’s got everything – cheeky hills, grassy and stony paths, and muddy puddles after the rain. Another draw, of course, is the Grade I-listed Dinosaur Court – a quirky collection of more than 30 dinosaur sculptures that have resided in the park since 1854. To see them in all their glory, enter the park from Thicket Road entrance on the south side and do a half a mile (0.8km) loop around Lower Lake. Then, explore the rest of the park by taking the 2.5-mile (4km) circuit around its periphery, taking on some challenging hills, or seek out the infamous Crystal Palace Park maze for a fun ersion before heading back south past the athletic stadium, to swing by the park’s charming urban farm – the goats are particularly curious about passing runners.The Fresh Foam X Hierro v5 is designed to go the distance.

I’m lucky enough to call Edinburgh home and the splendour of the city never ceases to amaze me.As daylight hours shorten, many runners would happily hang up their trainers for the winter but the rush of endorphins I get while running is the best thing to stave off seasonal sadness. When anxiety hits, I find the rhythmic pounding of my feet on the pavement and focusing on my breath calms my mind. The city is full of terrific running spots – from punishing peaks, to parks, to the gentle beauty of the beach. The only real difficulty you’ll have is deciding which one to tackle first.City centre sightseeingRunning is a brilliant way to see Edinburgh’s main historical landmarks and a jog through the city centre’s hilly streets really works up a sweat. For a pavement-heavy run, start at Waverley station and run west along the city’s main shopping thoroughfare past the famous Scott Monument, through the picturesque Princes Street Gardens, crunching through fallen leaves as you head towards Lothian Road. Swing left on to Kings Stables Road, then feel the gradient increase sharply at Johnston Terrace, marvelling as Edinburgh Castle looms above you.The brave can scale the 187 steps at Castle Wynd in a sprint to the castle esplanade, home to the annual military tattoo. After the uphill effort, I like to take a moment to catch my breath as I soak up the view of my beautiful birthplace, before running from the castle down the Royal Mile to the Palace of Holyroodhouse passing St Giles’ Cathedral this is a welcome downhill jog after the castle ascent.Holyrood Park and Arthur’s SeatAdjacent to the Palace of Holyroodhouse and the Scottish Parliament building is one of Edinburgh’s most famous landmarks – Arthur’s Seat. The extinct volcano dominates Edinburgh’s skyline and if you scale the peak, which sits 251m above sea level, you’ll be rewarded with panoramic views of the city and neighbouring Fife. Arthur’s Seat sits at the centre of Holyrood Park and the whole area holds a special place in my heart – it was the scene of my first ever 5K race and where I really caught the running bug.Portobello beachJust 3 miles (5km) from the city centre lies Portobello, a popular seaside destination for Edinburgh residents since the 19th century. I’ve been coming here since I was a child and find there’s nothing quite like the invigorating power of sea air to boost your mood and a beach run is the perfect antidote to the bustle of the city centre. A popular destination with runners, particularly following its inclusion in the Edinburgh Marathon route, the section of the promenade towards Musselburgh gives you the stunning view of the Firth of Forth on one side and elegant Georgian and Victorian architecture on the other. I usually choose to sprint along the smooth Victorian boardwalk but in colder weather find myself drawn to runs along the beach which glistens with frost in the winter, enjoying the sensation of sand moving underfoot. Once I work up an appetite, I visit one of the great selection of independent bars and cafes on the promenade for post-run refuelling.Water of Leith walkwayA combination of paved path and gravel track, this 12-mile (19km) walkway snakes through the city from the foot of the Pentland Hills to the port of Leith and is great for runners who enjoy off-road, traffic-free running, as I do. The route takes you through some of Edinburgh’s most attractive neighbourhoods and my favourite stretch of the path runs from the Shore in Leith to the Gallery of Modern Art via the Royal Botanic Gardens, swanky Stockbridge and the delightful Dean village. The area around the Dean village is particularly charming and features a fast-flowing, roaring current, tree-lined paths and bridges across the water.The running trail can sometimes get a bit muddy, so an all-terrain shoe is very much needed, and the waterway is home to lush vegetation, an abundance of wildlife and six life-size humanoid sculptures by award-winning artist Antony Gormley. As well as being a popular path for runners, you’ll also find the route frequented by friendly dog walkers, cyclists and even the occasional horse rider.Inverleith ParkJust to the north of the New Town and Stockbridge, you’ll find Inverleith Park – a sanctuary of green space in the heart of the capital and one of Scotland’s largest urban parks at 22 hectares (54 acres). Inverleith boasts a wonderful view of Edinburgh Castle and is a favourite spot for locals to assemble to watch the various firework displays that take place towards the end of the year.I love Inverleith because it’s a park that’s got something for everyone, including sports pitches, allotments, a pond and a children’s play area. The tree-lined park splits into four near equal parts by a combination of concrete path and muddy trail – and my favourite running routes takes the form of a figure of eight circuit of the grounds. I always make a point of visiting the recently installed wet garden, which includes a range of plant species that will help reduce blue-green algae in the water. A wooden boardwalk provides access to the area to view the flora and fauna that now inhabit the pond."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b83556a979bc7e429a2514c2bb39d08bf464884/0_143_2866_1720/master/2866.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0969795093e95b6f7e2668e15abf706","title":"astronomers discover huge gaseous wave holding milky ways newest stars","story":"‘It’s right up in our face’ – close proximity of stellar nursery to our solar system stuns scientists Astronomers have discovered a gigantic, undulating wave of dust and gas where newborn stars are forged over a 50 million billion mile stretch of the Milky Way.The gaseous structure, which holds more mass than 3m suns, runs directly behind our solar system as viewed from the heart of the galaxy, but has eluded observation until now.The spectacular string of stellar nurseries forms the largest known wave in the Milky Way and was announced, appropriately, at a scientific conference a stone’s throw from the surf mecca of Waikiki beach in Hawaii.“It is the largest gaseous structure we know about in the Milky Way,” said Alyssa Goodman, professor of applied astronomy at Harvard University, who presented the findings on Tuesday at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Honolulu. “It’s right up in our face. It’s crazy that it’s so close by.”Measurements of the wave show that it stretches over 9,000 light years and makes up what is known as the “local arm” of the Milky Way. Looking down on the flat disc of the galaxy, the wave appears as a straight line about 400 light years wide. But from the side, it rises and falls 500 light years above and below the plane of the galaxy. For comparison, the width of the solar system is about half a light day – the distance light travels in 12 hours.The discovery has thrown up a raft of questions, not least around how the wave formed. One idea is that a much smaller galaxy clattered into that part of the Milky Way in the far-flung past, setting off ripples that spread like those from a stone tossed into a pond. A more exotic hypothesis sees a role for the mysterious dark matter that lurks unseen around galaxies.If the wave was set off by a cosmic collision, the ripples may pull the enormous dense clouds of dust and gas around for millions of years to come before finally settling down. “We think the wave is dynamic but the timescale of its motion up and down, we really don’t know,” said Goodman.The astronomers, including Catherine Zucker and João Alves, discovered the cosmic wave while mapping the distribution of vast clouds of dust and gas that pepper our galactic neighbourhood. Inside these dense clouds, gas can be compressed to such extremes that new stars are born.To map the positions of the clouds, the scientists relied on the fact that just as the sun reddens at sunset, so starlight reddens as it passes through interstellar dust. With this in mind, they analysed the colours of stars whose distances had been measured with unprecedented accuracy by Gaia, the European Space Agency’s (Esa) spacecraft. The dust reddens the light of stars behind it, but has no effect on those in front.Writing in the journal Nature the astronomers describe how the map revealed the shape of the giant wave of connected clouds. While earlier studies had suggested a huge ring of stellar nurseries around the solar system known as Gould’s Belt , the new map shows there is no ring, but a massive wave instead.“It’s been a puzzle for decades as to why so many of our local Gould’s Belt star-forming regions lie so far out of the galactic plane,” said Jennifer Hatchell, an astrophysicist at Exeter University who was not involved in the study. “The previous expanding-ring model fitted cloud positions and velocities well but never entirely explained the fragmentary structure, rotation or the origin of the ring, which required the energetic equivalent of several supernovae.“This alternative linear structure is just the sort of insight we hoped would come out of Esa’s Gaia dataset, and the team deserve credit for their excellent analysis and visualisation work. It will be interesting to see how this develops as explanations are proposed for its origin and relationship to the galactic spiral arms.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/208e33ab75dc299554ca5c4ce9add9674fc6db65/81_191_3373_2023/master/3373.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b99b74cd185e16118b3ea3a3134bc9d9","title":"golf in defence of patrick reed","story":"The wave of indignity towards Reed has become more fascinating than the essentially minor matter that caused itTwelve years have passed since a banking executive took a prestigious golf club in the Highlands of Scotland to court after being suspended for allegedly cheating in a match. Decades earlier in the same part of the country, an inidual collected a trophy for a competition he hadn’t played in. Upon the reality of that case coming to light, the gentleman in question emigrated to Canada. The common thread for these, and scores of other cases, is that the c-word even when attached to amateur golfers has potentially life-changing repercussions. Cheat on your partner by all means – brag about it in the clubhouse, even – but don’t mark a golf ball closer to the hole.For Patrick Reed, an end-of-year jaunt to the Bahamas has ended up resonating beyond a guaranteed pay day, some sunshine and preparation for the following week’s President’s Cup. By the time Reed took to the course in Royal Melbourne – in an event hardly depicted by the smell of cordite – he had been called out by a member of the opposition team and suffered cat-calling from galleries.The latter went on, and on, and on, until Reed’s caddie and brother-in-law snapped in retaliation during the penultimate day to the point where he was asked to sit out the final session. A sin-binned caddie – this is unheard of. Fast forward to Sunday in Maui, that notoriously hostile sporting environment, and a spectator bawled “cheater” at Reed on the final green of the Tournament of Champions. Quite what Reed may be subjected to at the Players Championship, where Floridians make drinking on empty heads a virtue, or the US Open, which takes place on the outskirts of New York, is anyone’s guess. Reed at least has the moderate comfort of a home Ryder Cup later in 2020.How did we reach this point? Reed’s brushing of sand, twice, behind his ball in a waste area at the Hero World Challenge earned him a two-stroke penalty and the wrath of the golfing world. Essentially, Reed had improved his lie. The golfer’s own assertions – and he delivered this in a totally convincing manner – that he had no idea exactly what had transpired have cut little ice. “I think with a different camera angle they would have seen it was not improving the lie as I was far enough away from the golf ball,” Reed said.So why accept the penalty? “It is my word against their word and because they only have one camera angle, I don’t really have a choice. After seeing it brush some sand, they thought that was a breach and, in the Rules of Golf , if you improve your lie, it is a penalty. At the end of the day you have to accept it and move on.”Reed didn’t know he would be subject to a meeting with rules officials until he finished that round. When citing availability or otherwise of camera angles, the 2018 Masters champion would be taking an outrageous gamble if actually wanting to be certain there was no alternative footage (as did prove the case). Top level players now are subject to such scrutiny that actively seeking to break rules is futile. People watching the Reed match live didn’t notice anything unusual about his actions on the now infamous 11th at Albany.The wave of indignity towards Reed has become more fascinating than the essentially minor matter that caused it. This has roots in the essential commodity of intent: sniping galleries and social media commandos are absolutely adamant Reed broke a rule on purpose, thereby seeking to gain an advantage. Reed himself says the opposite. How on earth can anybody, with certainty, contradict the Texan? And on the basis they can’t, this situation has become wholly disproportionate to the point of unfairness.It is therefore instructive and hilariously inconsistent how use of rules shape perception. You needn’t wander far through tales of Seve Ballesteros’s greatness to realise he had a penchant for bending scenarios to his advantage. This adds to the Spaniard’s legend. Dustin Johnson’s relief from a TV tower and deep rough in the crucial throngs of the 2016 US Open – which he won – remains iffy to those who believe in the spirit of rules as well as the black and white of them. If back stories are key, as has been implied regards Reed, then nobody chooses to look too closely at Johnson.Was Jordan Spieth’s drop for the ages in the 2017 Open at Birkdale an act of genius or outrageous abuse of process? Bryson DeChambeau’s glacial pace of play, which erupted into a storm last season, isn’t defined as cheating when arguably it should be such antics have a detrimental impact on other players in the field. Phil Mickelson can readily admit to wilfully breaching the rules of golf during the US Open of two years ago – the left hander started playing hockey mid-round – without any lasting consequence because … he is Phil Mickelson.We could go on, even before starting on the vomit-inducing desire of Mickelson and others to beat a path to Saudi Arabia for a golf tournament where appearance fees equal the GDP of a small nation. Instead, Reed is berated for adjusting some sand – when nobody knows if it was intentional – and not subsequently behaving according to the “Here’s How to Act Post Penalty” manual.The good news for Reed is that he never appears altogether bothered by external opinion. Yet if this issue doesn’t reflect well on him, it unquestionably looks worse for those so desperate to castigate or bawl. Golf can well do without them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af950aded0768e3fbe376cdb4f50e9c77d69e65c/0_99_2041_1225/master/2041.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=550b57498760ff4b6e6b004cb36aa9eb","title":"tom brady future new team new england patriots nfl","story":"A disappointing season has many wondering whether the quarterback will make a move away from New England in 2020. Where is he likely to land?At 42, the end is near for Tom Brady, though the quarterback insists he can still play until he’s at least 45. In the aftermath of his team’s playoff loss to the Tennessee Titans on Saturday, Brady said it was “pretty unlikely” that he would retire. That has crystallized in recent days to more of a no way, and on Wednesday he wrote on Instagram that said: “I still have more to prove”. Which leads us to the biggest question in the NFL: with free agency an option, where will Brady lineup in 2020?Why he should go: Returning to the Patriots remains the most logical outcome. Brady’s play declined in 2019, no question about it. Though his arm strength and pocket mobility remain in full bloom (he is, stunningly, more athletic now than he was in his early 20s) his decision making – where he is going with the ball, and whether or not he should take a hit – were up-and-down throughout the season.Regardless, it’s still hard to picture him in another jersey. Head coach Bill Belichick already lost a time-to-move-on tussle with his star quarterback and owner Robert Kraft a few seasons ago, with Brady sticking around and Belichick forced to trade his understudy, Jimmy Garoppolo. If Brady wants back, it will be Kraft’s decision as much as Belichick’s. With added weapons in 2020, there’s no reason why Brady couldn’t be the most effective QB option for the Patriots, with a rookie watching and learning for a season or two.Why he shouldn’t: Something was wrong with the Patriots offense all season. A midseason move to acquire Mohammed Sanu for a future second-round pick turned out to be a disaster. N’Keal Harry, only the second wide receiver drafted by the Patriots in the first round during the Belichick era, could not get on the same page with Brady.Brady doesn’t have time to watch young guys grow, he needs help now. Whether the Patriots can acquire that help or not this offseason is an open question. Add to that: Brady’s long-term collaborator, offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, is set to finally leave the franchise. Perhaps Brady wants to follow McDaniels to his new spot?Likelihood of deal: Highly likelyWhy he should go: If Brady is to move, it’s hard to find a better batch of weapons, with a quarterback opening, than in Carolina. The Panthers have the players but need a healthy quarterback: Cam Newton has been unable to stay on the field in recent years, and Carolina is ready to move on. Owner David Tepper is ambitious, and he will do whatever is needed to add Brady and to surround the quarterback with the talent – on and off-the-field – to compete right away. Adding Brady would give the Panthers a chance to chase a long-term fix in the draft while riding out the final two years of a legend’s career, forever associating themselves with the best to ever do it. And they wouldn’t have to sink franchise money into Newton for the next four-to-five years.Why he shouldn’t: Going to a new organization is hard, even for the greatest players. This made more sense before the Panthers hired ex-college coach Matt Rhule to a mega-money deal. Had McDaniels come, he and Brady could have lifted the Patriots blueprint and dropped it in Carolina. Now, Brady would be working with a first-time NFL head coach – though he may see that as a bonus: giving him complete control over the offense.Likelihood of deal: Unlikely, but not impossibleWhy he should go: LA are the sexiest pick. The Chargers will be entering a new stadium in 2020 as the little sibling in a partnership with the Rams. Grabbing Brady would give them much-needed oomph, and would steal some of the attention away from the Rams, who seem to have a vice-like grip on LA fandom.The Chargers have the weapons, too. They legitimately run seven deep with good skill position players, of all body shapes and sizes. They should have one of the most erse, complete offenses in the game, and they have similar talent on defense. They are built to compete now, and play in Brady’s home state. Also, those powder blue uniforms. I mean, come on. They’re the best in football.Why he shouldn’t: Sure, the Chargers have the weapons, but their issues in recent years have stemmed from an awful offensive line. They’ve poured in resources, but due to injuries and draftfree agency misses nothing has improved.Likelihood of deal: The most likely spot if he leavesWhy he should go: Tampa has a host of weapons – Mike Evans is one of the league’s best receivers – a solid if unspectacular offensive line and a proven coach, one who has thrived with aging, veteran quarterbacks.Why he shouldn’t: It’s an iffy fit. Bruce Arians is a vertical coach. He likes to chuck the ball downfield, run the ball, then chuck it down the field some more. That’s not Brady’s game.Likelihood of deal: Tough to pictureWhy he should: Not so much should as may. It’s hard to find a great fit outside of New England. If Brady can’t find that and Belichick makes it clear he’s ready to move on, would Brady step aside rather than battling it out on a barren roster?Why he shouldn’t: Brady can still play. Comparisons to Peyton Manning or John Elway’s final year are unfair. Brady’s arm strength is the same now as it was when he was 30, and he moves even better. The question is whether he’s willing to stand in the pocket and take a shot in order to deliver the best throw possible. It seemed like he was saving himself for the postseason (and life beyond football) for much of 2019. When the time came to flip the switch in the playoffs, it didn’t happen. New England’s offense wasn’t good. And while Brady’s skill players deserve some blame, he left a lot of opportunities on the field and never had the team playing in rhythm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bb890c76e2a7913fc10f6aa2d48f19c2f338941/0_737_1800_1079/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23e0c881c4f99560df73355cae4d0ea3","title":"masculinity is back the lesbian comics rediscovering their butch side","story":"Hannah Gadsby made butchness cool again. Now a crop of queer comics are getting back to boots, quiffs and tachesSarah Keyworth has, she says, a “weird kind of relationship with masculinity”. She appears confident in her dapper, boyish looks, with her short quiffed hair, but behind that handsome veneer are insecurities. “I almost have toxic masculinity,” she says, “in that I can never meet the standards that I think masculinity has. I’m not big and I’m not strong, physically or emotionally.” And she cries, she says. She cries a lot.The Nottingham-raised, 26-year-old comic is among a crop of lesbian and queer comedians embracing their masculinity on stage in the era of #MeToo, after years of being made to feel ashamed. Their stories were, arguably, smashed on to the mainstream circuit with the global success of Hannah Gadsby’s moving show Nanette, in which she refused to make any more self-deprecating jokes about being a gender non-conforming woman.I meet Keyworth, who has supported Gadsby on tour, in the bar at London’s Soho theatre. Later in the month she will be here with her new show Pacific, in which she grapples with her ingrained ideas about “strength equalling masculinity”. This means, despite her small stature, she mistakenly thinks of herself as the “protector” in her relationship with fellow comic Catherine Bohart. “Actually, she keeps me alive,” Keyworth says. Elsewhere in the set, she talks about how she and some male comedians took weeks to realise they were being harassed by a female colleague, having initially brushed it off in a “weird masculine” way.Keyworth spent years trying to hide her masculinity because of societal pressure: “I was made to feel like it was negative to be strong or broad or have a deep voice, to do anything that was slightly manly, and I didn’t want to be. I wanted to be like the other girls because I desperately wanted to fit in. I wanted to be petite and cute and pretty. Not because that was me, but because it felt like an easier life.” She is critical of how gendered clothing is for children, and says the only time she saw women similar to her being represented was in a shame-inducing way, like the classic “angry, men-hating lesbian”.On stage, Keyworth is witty and engaging, often combining the serious meaning behind her skits with a crassness that helps her cutting jokes induce laughs. She credits her queer and non-binary friends for helping her to celebrate who she is, including comedy duo Shelf, who are part of the LOL Word collective. (Another LOL Word member, Chloe Petts, will explore masculinity in her forthcoming show Alpha.) Keyworth loves messing with gender. “It’s fun to play with androgyny. It’s fun to have the freedom to be who you are,” she says. “It’s so much more fun wearing trainers than heels. I have much softer feet now.”When I call the American comedian Cameron Esposito, she remembers what it was like “being a kid who always went as, like, Robin Hood for Halloween, when everybody else was a sexy cat”. Esposito, 38, has charted her journey in a book, Save Yourself. When she was younger, Esposito had few role models beyond the musicians Tegan and Sara. Now, she praises other masculine-presenting queer comedians, from Sam Jay and DeAnne Smith to Irene Tu.She is intentionally visible about being a butch woman, particularly on social media. “Dancing, secure in my masculinity,” she captioned one video post on Twitter. It’s a message Esposito also takes to her performances, giving feedback to “specifically butch folks” after shows, or those with a “haircut that may not always bring them peace”.While she has it better than her fans, she says: “I still get shit yelled at me in the street.” And Esposito flags that her appearance doesn’t mean she escapes sexual harassment. She tells me that recently one man, whom she had thought of as a friend, masturbated while on the phone to her without her consent. One of Esposito’s previous shows, Rape Jokes, detailed her experiences of sexual assault.While Esposito’s stage persona is loud, charming and chatty, she is adept at ing into the hard-hitting details of personal subjects, which, alongside sexual abuse, have included the impact her strict Catholic upbringing had on her coming out as a lesbian and her profound love for the queer community.Esposito says she has been discussing identity for years, and it is only now starting to rise to the surface. “In general, folks are being allowed to exist as we already are,” she says. “Marketability looks a little different now than it used to.” She highlights long-established butch comedians such as Lea DeLaria, who was only propelled into the spotlight relatively recently for her role in Orange Is the New Black, adding: “We’ve always been here, we just didn’t have the opportunities.”Although her next show focuses on her orce from comic Rhea Butcher (as well as how she gets confused with US soccer star Megan Rapinoe), Esposito expects her future material will continue to examine her evolving relationship with gender “as I catch up with myself”.“We’re always, in comedy, trying to cut as close to the bone as we can and be as current as possible. But we’re still figuring it out. So, check back with me – on the hair colour and the pant cut.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0ef59a897efee4b273258b5f58495645145f8cf/0_358_5364_3218/master/5364.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5676fc3a757e5cbe5d53b82de2a69d6f","title":"send tip healthy holidays europe win 200 pound hotel voucher","story":"Whether it was yoga or mindfulness, a spa break or immersion in nature, we’d love to hear about breaks in Europe that have given you a sense of wellbeingPerhaps you’ve kickstarted an exercise campaign or rebooted yourself with a meditation holiday.

That’s perhaps an obvious fit for the freshman congresswoman, who ousted a 10-term incumbent without any lobbyist cash (although it is worth noting that concerns have been raised around this breed, as some have trouble breathing).As legend has it, a dog says a lot about its owner. That saying surely holds even more relevance when it comes to politicians. Second only to babies, pets are a choice weapon for politicians who want to soften their image. Their canine best friend holds a special role: to project the image that the politician wants the public to have of them.Here is our take on what the following dogs say about their political owners.Mayor Pete wants you to know his dog is a fighter. Part pug, part beagle, his dog Buddy only has one eye and looks somewhat menacing. Which is just as well, considering Buttigieg’s attempts at convincing us of his fighting credentials haven’t exactly paid off.Buttigieg has mentioned his time in the military hundreds of times during his campaign trail, describing it as “dangerous”, and bragging about time he spent “outside the wire”. Alas, documents seem to suggest that Buttigieg didn’t spend any time in direct combat during his time in the army. But the dog still looks tough.Boris Johnson’s dog is a Jack Russell with floppy blond hair. They say a Jack Russell is a small dog with a big attitude, which is fitting for a prime minister who wrote a back-up newspaper column arguing that the UK should stay in the EU, then campaigned to leave, pushed for a hard Brexit and asked everyone if they still wanted to be mates after.The Canadian prime minister has many things going for him. He recently got a beard, when he roasts Donald Trump alongside world leaders they all laugh, and he has a cute dog. No wonder Melania kissed him.When Elizabeth Warren was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, her students surprised her one day with a golden retriever puppy. That puppy, Otis, didn’t make it to see Warren’s presidential bid, having died in 2012. But Warren, ever the woman with a plan, wasn’t going to let that stop her. She replaced Otis last year with another golden retriever, this time named Bailey.Joe Biden has two dogs, and like any guy trying to rebuild the soul of the nation, he rescued them both. Biden’s dogs are German shepherds named Champ and Major – although he probably would have called them “Man” and “Folks”, if they were more acceptable dog names.We are aware that Marlon Bundo is a rabbit, not a dog. Mike Pence also has a dog, but that seemed far less interesting than Bundo, who has its own Wikipedia page. Bundo is colloquially known as Botus – or Bunny of the United States. He has been described as the “only positive thing in Washington”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2be75dcdd7a1d5f554cd53da6f6fc7f540b27e77/0_220_5226_3134/master/5226.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3eb88282c186b2ee23b58362bc0b6d5e","title":"us citizens in iraq tell us about your situation","story":"We’d like to hear from US citizens in Iraq about their situation following embassy advice to leave the country.

Here global heating is no theoretical calamity of the future, but a very real, present danger.Here, the climate crisis is so palpable that the debate is not about restricting carbon emissions or preventing global warming but about how to adapt to the change and survive in times of unpredictable weather.For example, Mondal says that where once his peers would farm mainly rice, now they have taken to fishing. They use floating cages, allowing fish to breed in a secure area. Also, if water levels rise, the cages will too, so flooding is less of an issue.“About 20 to 30 years ago there would be a minimum of two crops per farming family but now because of waterlogging we have no more than one,” he says. Each cage is owned by one home and yields about 15,000 taka (£135) in additional income for the families a year. It’s also a consistent source of food, which could be vital if natural disaster hits. “In the last two years there was not too much rain but two years ago we were flooded,” Mondal says. “We worry about the future. If there is heavy rainfall the water could remain logged for a long period of time and we would have to take shelter on main road. We would stay there with our remaining belongings.”This farming evolution is just one element of a whole range of climate change adaptive practices taking root across southern Bangladesh, an area long prone to cyclones, rising sea levels and drought.“What’s important is investment in long-term development, to help people adapt to the effects that climate change is having now and help them to not only survive but thrive in their new climate reality,” said Adib Hossain, the head of programmes implementation at Practical Action, one of the charities helping to make changes.In this part of Bangladesh they have helped introduce effective fertilisers to increase crop growth as well as growing fish in cages and vegetation in sacks or beside rivers – a novel farming technique known as a “dyke garden”.Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theThe cages are made using cheap materials. Bamboo poles form an outer frame that can float and is covered in netting. They have a top cover to prevent fish jumping and escaping, or being caught by birds. With a capacity of one cubic metre, they hold up to 300 fish at a time. These cages are used for two growing seasons each year.The fish can be fed on scraps and waste – duckweed, oil cake, kitchen waste, rice bran and snails – and in just a few months they grow to full size.A woman standing beside Mondal goes down in a small wooden boat and pulls up the mesh cage, within which fish jump up and splutter around. She drops the net and they swim around once more. For the worried farmers in this area, the introduction of these cages has been reassuring, a constant amid a lot of inconsistency.In the nearby district of South Atulia another innovative technique has been employed. Land here is being used for fishing, with pools of water separated by a cracked mud path and spiky vegetation. Omal Biswas, 48, has three daughters and an adopted son. He used to farm rice once a year and during the monsoon he would fish in freshwater. Now he is able to make more money with dyke gardening techniques, growing vegetables around pools of water used for fishing.Omal has just harvested a crop, he says. They grow bottle gourd, chillis, indian spinach, red amaranth, sponge gourd, ridge gourd and tomatoes. “Before this technology was used I would yield around 20-25,000 taka a year but last year I harvested 120,000 taka through using different varieties of vegetables and growing more in the year.“Now I can grow vegetables while fishing but I used to rotate the land. I eat the vegetables too,” he adds. He adds that the additional income helps give them a better quality of life and now he has been able to buy six cows. “The cost of living is rising and the cost of production is increasing so it is a good portion of revenue,” he says.Practical Action isn’t the only charity supporting farmers. The National Agriculture Technology Program (NATP 2) by the World Bank has also helped people adopt resilient farming methods.Farmers have deployed ancient agricultural methods such as floating beds, which involve sowing crops onto floating islands made of the fast-growing water hyacinth. Crops such as cucumbers, gourds and eggplants flourish. Beds are raised so as to lie above the reach of tidal surges. In between, trenches serve as pools to farm fish and ducks.Others have turned to shrimp farming after land was flooded but Practical Action has helped people do this in a more effective way.Rubina Khatun is one woman who has benefited from this. “The cyclone affected my family. I swam across flood waters with my two sons and took refuge on the road and sheltered in a shop we own for two months. Then we returned to our home,” she says.Shrimp farming is now a major source of income for her family. The technique used to farm the shrimp more effectively includes using deeper water so the temperature does not change as quickly, and adding a fertiliser made from oil cake, date juice and sugar cane among other things.“I am not sure what I would do without it now,” Khatun says. “But this type of farming is weather dependent. We need rain. If there is less rainfall salinity increases.”Despite efforts to improve the situation, Bangladesh remains at the mercy of sharp changes in weather patterns. Deep uncertainty persists for millions, even if these newfound techniques are helped to mitigate environmental impact.“I am worried,” Khatun says. “Too much or too little rain, both are problematic.”For her, however, the concept of climate change is a world away. “I can feel it in terms of rain but I am not aware of this. I have heard non-government-organisations talking about it but just as a concept. All I know is shrimp farming is a major source of income out of all the ones remaining, so it’s a reassurance.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

More than 200 people had taken shelter in a gymnasium after a first quake on Monday, only for the latest shake to damage that structure, forcing them to sleep outside.Among them was 80-year-old Lupita Martínez, who sat in the dusty parking lot with her 96-year-old husband by her side. He was sleeping in a makeshift bed, a dark blue coat covering him.“There’s no power. There’s no water. There is nothing. This is horrible,” Martínez said.﻿The US federal disaster agency Fema said Donald Trump had signed an emergency declaration for Puerto Rico because of the quake.As authorities on the island assessed damage from the latest tremor, Democrats in Congress issued demands that the administration release $8.3bn in disaster recovery approved after the island was slammed by Hurricanes Maria and Irma in 2017.Democratic 2020 candidates also weighed in with calls for official assistance – and criticized the administration for holding up aid after Maria.A Fema report into its response to Hurricanes Irma, María and Harvey in 2017, which overall affected 47 million people, concluded the agency needed to improve “overall readiness and resiliency for future incidents”.In October, the housing and urban development secretary, Ben Carson, was forced to defend the agency against accusations that administrators intentionally missed a legally required deadline that would have given billions in federal housing funds to the island.“The Trump administration has failed the people of Puerto Rico,” Bernie Sanders said in his tweet, adding: “We must do everything we can to rebuild.”Joe Biden said it was “unconscionable” that disaster recovery work remained undone and called for delivery of “concrete support” to Puerto Rico.“I’ll fight to ensure they receive the disaster assistance they need and deserve to recover from these earthquakes,” Elizabeth Warren tweeted.Pete Buttigieg said Puerto Ricans “must be assured the administration will act quickly”.Senators Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker also issued calls for a coherent official response.About 750 people spent Tuesday night in shelters in southern towns hit hardest by the earthquake. Television images showed flattened homes and apartment buildings with deep cracks running down their exteriors in communities such as Guánica and Ponce.Bottled water, batteries and flashlights ran low at supermarkets in the capital, San Juan, and long lines formed outside gas stations. Puerto Ricans are used to dealing with hurricanes but powerful quakes are rare on the island.“There’s a lot of uncertainty, this is the first time this has happened to us,” said Patricia Alonso, 48, who lost power and water at her home and headed to her mother’s apartment building with her 13-year-old son as it had a generator.﻿Tuesday’s quake struck at a depth of six miles (10km) at 4.24am near Ponce, the US Geological Survey said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Francis gives light-hearted reaction after nun asks for kiss at weekly general audienceFather of four Joe Sinnott (65), who died off Hook Head, was \u0026lsquodoing something he loved\u0026rsquoDisease can affect humans if they come into close contact with infected animalsQuinn is ally of stockbroker Roy Barrett, who is close to accepting role of chairpersonGarda\u0026iacute had to pull Andrzej Tadel off the woman during alleged daytime assault, court toldTwo men arrested in Co Monaghan after driving as far as Armagh before crashing in RepublicNumber of members of force underwent medical treatment after patrol car rammedFrankie Dunne (64) remembered as a \u0026lsquogood natured man\u0026rsquo and loving to all he metM28 Steering Group set up to represent 10,000 residents facing major impact over motorway upgradeSix establishments issued with closure orders in December including Lidl branchFormer RT\u0026Eacute radio presenter died at care centre on Tuesday following recent illnessDundalk woman facing charges related to alleged membership of Islamic StateParty declines to indicate if it will support quick passage of legislation before an electionUnions call for pay parity with colleagues in rest of UK as appointments and treatments cancelled\u0026lsquoSomebody lost the run of themselves\u0026rsquo over event, says ex-senator Maurice ManningWilliam Whelan (41) was on the Alize when boat sank off Co Wexford on Saturday nightRoy Barrett thought to be considering position but yet to reach final decisionMedical training and staffing is in a mess, with serious implications for patient safetyInexperienced doctors recruited to work as experienced staff move abroad for jobs"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4133975.1578497446!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"former ireland striker niall quinn may take up a role in fai","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Niall Quinn’s high profile may seen him targeted for a public-facing role focused on reforms aimed at improving the image of the game and reinvigorating the grassroots of Irish football. Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireImpending changes at the top of the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) may open the door for former Ireland striker Niall Quinn to take up a role in Irish football, several well-placed sources believe.The former Arsenal and Sunderland player is a close ally of Goodbody Stockbrokers managing director Roy Barrett, who is close to accepting the role of indepedent chairperson at the association.Mr Quinn, who won 92 caps for the international team in a career that ran from the 1980s to the 2000s, is not thought to be interested in the role of chief executive on a permanent or interim basis, believing a corporate governance expert best suited for the role.However, the Dublin native’s high profile may seen him targeted for a public-facing role focused on reforms aimed at improving the image of the game and reinvigorating the grassroots of Irish football. Such a role could also strengthen the case for the reintroduction of state funding, which has been suspended since a scandal over corporate governance at the FAI erupted last spring.In May of last year Mr Barrett was named as part of a “Football in Ireland Visionary Group” chaired by Mr Quinn, which produced a document detailing proposals for governance, welfare and commerical changes at the FAI.Voluntary roleMr Quinn is thought to be interested in a voluntary role with the association, which could also entail working on the introduction of a community-focused entity modeled on The Foundation of Light, a charity set up by Sunderland FC.Such a platform would be focused on encouraging youth activity in a range of educational and socially beneficial activities, particularly in underprivileged areas, through football.He is also thought to be interested in shaking up the League of Ireland, as well as lobbying the government on specific initiatives he has worked on, such as carving out a portion of the betting tax to fund the development of football in Ireland.There is a growing expectation that appointments to the board could be made as soon as Wednesday evening, with the appointments committee of the FAI scheduled to meet tonight to discuss the candidacies of Mr Barrett and up to three other independent directors.Minister for Sport Shane Ross has said that he expects the independent director roles to be filled by the end of this week.Mr Quinn is a former chairman of English club Sunderland FC, and has forged a career in business as well as serving on the board of Sport Ireland for a time. Last year he was part of a group that proposed splitting the FAI into two separate organisations, and changing the way appointments to the board are made."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Iran missile attacks: Iran \u0026#39aiming to miss\u0026#39 when it hit US bases in Iraq with 22 rockets, suggests Pentagon - latest newsIran plane crash: Ukraine refuses to rule out Boeing 737 was shot down by missile near Tehran killing 176Exclusive: Killer of Helen McCourt to be released as parole board rejects Justice Secretary\u0026#39s appeal for rethinkBrigitte Macron launches first major public role at hospital charity as husband faces ire of French doctorsKeir Starmer: the high-flying law man desperate to stress his working class credentialsFrance\u0026#39s national police chief resigns amid reports he is \u0026#39washed out\u0026#39 from handling yellow vest revoltOttawa shooter at large after one left deadInside the koala hospital helping  animals recover from horrific burns as bushfires sweep across AustraliaComment: How should Britain react to the escalating crisis in Iran?\tIran plane crash analysis: What happened mid-air and who has the black box?Uber driver cleared of a sword attack on police outside Buckingham Palace planned a terror attack on tourists in LondonComment: Unless Labour learns the Tory virtue of ruthlessness, it will continue to be led by failures and liabilitiesSign up for royal fashion WhatsApp updates direct to your phone during the royal tourIran plane crash: British newlywed was only on doomed flight because he stayed in Tehran to prolong wedding celebrationsIran fires 22 missiles at US targets in Iraq in retaliation for killing of Qassim Soleimani We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/07/TELEMMGLPICT000220660571_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJweNtxj9PZ-PQqqpH_qJ95Uw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"rolls royce no longer just chauffeured ceos custom made suvs","story":"A new Rolls-Royce Phantom  commissioned by a Stockholm-based entrepreneurMost Rolls-Royce owners used to be captains of industry, in their mid-fifties, and driven around by a chauffeur.But the average age has dropped to 43 in a decade, as the carmaker’s first SUV and custom-made ranges attract sports stars, celebrities and influencers who are getting rich quick.Sales of the luxury British car have hit an all-time record as Rolls-Royce reaps the reward of its strategy to shed its fusty image and target younger buyers.“About 20 per cent of Rolls-Royce buyers are celebrities, people from the sport, music and film worlds,” said Torsten Müller-Ötvös, the chief executive.“Digital industries also mean the world of ultra high net worth iniduals is changing. People are becoming wealthy at such speeds now.” As a result, the average age of buyers is down 13 years on a decade ago, when Mr Müller-Ötvös became head of the BMW-owned business.The British composer and member of the group the Beatles posing in his house\u0026#39s garage in Liverpool with his son in front of his psychedelic Rolls Royce The more youthful drivers are also opting to drive themselves the company believes just a quarter of its cars are chauffeured.Customers have been attracted to the manufacturer because of the opportunity to customise their car, limited only by imagination and legal requirements over vehicle design.Cars with million-pound price tags are now common at the Goodwood production plant in Chichester, West Sussex, Mr Müller-Ötvös said. Pundits say the one-off Sweptail built by Rolls-Royce in 2017 cost more than £10 million. Last year a new Rolls-Royce Phantom was commissioned by a Stockholm-based entrepreneur requesting a flower garden design on the inside, with one million stitches.Younger buyers have also been wooed by the company’s Black Badge line of modified cars, giving Rolls-Royce a newer, edgy image.Launched four years ago, high-performance Black Badge cars are aimed at what the firm calls a “subversive cohort who take risks, break rules and build success on their own terms”. It describes a Black Badge version of the Cullinan as its “darkest and most urban statement yet”.The change in tack is a far cry from John Lennon’s famous Rolls-Royce Phantom, currently owned by the Royal British Columbia Museum in Canada, which was sent to a specialist for a psychedelic paint job in the \u2028 Sixties.About a third of Rolls-Royce’s customers now visit the company’s base to oversee the personal touches.A new class of owner is also seeking out new models, such as the Cullinan 4x4, Rolls-Royce’s first SUV, which costs from £250,000.Mamadou Sakho with his family and Rolls RoyceNamed after the largest diamond ever found, the Cullinan accounted for 40 per cent of all its cars sold in 2019 – its first full year on the market.Eight out of 10 Cullinans have been bought by customers who had not previously owned a Rolls. “These are clients we have not seen before,” Mr Müller-Ötvös said. “Most already have other cars Cullinan is an addition to their garage.”SUVs have grown to be the biggest-selling car style in Europe, making up 40 per cent of the market. Rolls-Royce has been criticised for being late to the market. Yesterday rivals Bentley reported sales of its SUV, the Bentayga, were up 18 per cent.Mr Müller-Ötvös said: “This was a delicate exercise for the brand and we took our time. We were not late to the party – we arrived with it in full swing.” He added: “This is a British success story. It is not just about Cullinan but it is the shining star.”About 30 per cent of Rolls-Royce’s cars are sold in the US, ahead of China at 25 per cent, and then the UK and Europe at 20 per cent. Middle East sales account for 15 per cent.   Exclusive: Killer of Helen McCourt to be released as parole board rejects Justice Secretary\u0026#39s appeal for rethinkIran plane crash: Ukraine refuses to rule out Boeing 737 was shot down by missile near Tehran killing 176Iran missile attacks: Iran \u0026#39aiming to miss\u0026#39 when it hit US bases in Iraq with 22 rockets, suggests Pentagon - latest newsBrigitte Macron launches first major public role at hospital charity as husband faces ire of French doctorsKeir Starmer: the high-flying law man desperate to stress his working class credentialsFrance\u0026#39s national police chief resigns amid reports he is \u0026#39washed out\u0026#39 from handling yellow vest revoltOttawa shooter at large after one left deadInside the koala hospital helping  animals recover from horrific burns as bushfires sweep across AustraliaComment: How should Britain react to the escalating crisis in Iran?\tIran plane crash analysis: What happened mid-air and who has the black box?Uber driver cleared of a sword attack on police outside Buckingham Palace planned a terror attack on tourists in LondonComment: Unless Labour learns the Tory virtue of ruthlessness, it will continue to be led by failures and liabilitiesSign up for royal fashion WhatsApp updates direct to your phone during the royal tourIran plane crash: British newlywed was only on doomed flight because he stayed in Tehran to prolong wedding celebrationsIran fires 22 missiles at US targets in Iraq in retaliation for killing of Qassim Soleimani PhD student took her own life after classmates mocked her for not being \u0026#39posh enough\u0026#39, inquest hearsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/08/TELEMMGLPICT000220718106_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"iran missile qa happens next enough satisfy tehrans need revenge","story":"Iranians celebrate in the street after missiles launched at US-led forces in IraqThe Iranian military fired 22 missiles from Iran at US bases in Iraq in retaliation for America’s killing of Qassim Soleimani.  According to the Iraqi military, 17 missiles were fired at the al-Asad airbase in western Iraq and five missiles were fired at a smaller base in Irbil in northeast Iraq.All indications right now are that no one was killed or injured in the missile barrage. US officials say there were no American casualties and the Iraqi army say none of its personnel were killed. The Ministry of Defence says there were no UK casualties. Iran is signaling that it does not plan further direct attacks against the US and is not looking for further escalation.  “Iran took and concluded proportionate measures in self-defence,” said Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister. “We do not seek escalation or war, but will defend ourselves against any aggression.” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, said military action alone was “not sufficient” to avenge Soleimani and suggested he wanted to see a broader political effort to expel the US from the Middle East. The ball is firmly in Donald Trump’s court. The US president must decide if he’s prepared to ignore the Iranian missiles and move on, in which case there is a good chance the cycle of escalation stops, or whether American credibility and his own political prestige demand that the US retaliates. If he chooses the second option we should expect more shooting in the days to come. Mr Trump at al-Asad air base in DecemberMr Trump is due to speak on Wednesday morning US time but his early response has been uncharacteristically relaxed. “All is well! Missiles launched from Iran at two military bases located in Iraq. Assessment of casualties \u0026amp damages taking place now. So far, so good!” he wrote on Twitter.  It will be a bit humbling for Iran if their “severe revenge” for Soleimani’s death is essentially a fireworks show that didn’t kill anyone. But there may also be sighs of relief in Tehran that no Americans were killed as the Iranian regime is eager to avoid a head-on war with superior US forces. For now, Tehran has video footage missiles lifting off into the night in defiance of the US, which will no doubt play on a loop for days on pro-government television. Iran\u0026#39s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei delivers a speech during a gathering in TehranAnd it can muddy the waters in the information war by suggesting to its own public that the Western media is lying that there were no US casualties. Meanwhile, it is likely to continue planning covert action against US interests.Mr Trump threatened last week to hit 52 targets in Iran in retaliation for any Iranian strike and his public image is built upon being the tough man who brooks no defiance from Iran. So it will be a bit of a political climb down for him to let these missiles go unanswered. But there is a political win here for Mr Trump if he chooses to take it. He doesn’t want a war with Iran and he knows the American public doesn’t either. If he de-escalates now he can say that he killed Soleimani, taught Iran a lesson for attacking the US embassy in Baghdad, and proved that the Democrats were being hysterical when they predicted that Soleimani’s death would lead to war. Iran plane crash: Ukraine refuses to rule out Boeing 737 was shot down by missile near Tehran killing 176Exclusive: Killer of Helen McCourt to be released as parole board rejects Justice Secretary\u0026#39s appeal for rethinkIran missile attacks: Iran \u0026#39aiming to miss\u0026#39 when it hit US bases in Iraq with 22 rockets, suggests Pentagon - latest newsBrigitte Macron launches first major public role at hospital charity as husband faces ire of French doctorsKeir Starmer: the high-flying law man desperate to stress his working class credentialsFrance\u0026#39s national police chief resigns amid reports he is \u0026#39washed out\u0026#39 from handling yellow vest revoltOttawa shooter at large after one left deadInside the koala hospital helping  animals recover from horrific burns as bushfires sweep across AustraliaComment: How should Britain react to the escalating crisis in Iran?\tIran plane crash analysis: What happened mid-air and who has the black box?Uber driver cleared of a sword attack on police outside Buckingham Palace planned a terror attack on tourists in LondonComment: Unless Labour learns the Tory virtue of ruthlessness, it will continue to be led by failures and liabilitiesSign up for royal fashion WhatsApp updates direct to your phone during the royal tourIran plane crash: British newlywed was only on doomed flight because he stayed in Tehran to prolong wedding celebrationsIran fires 22 missiles at US targets in Iraq in retaliation for killing of Qassim Soleimani PhD student took her own life after classmates mocked her for not being \u0026#39posh enough\u0026#39, inquest hearsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 8 january 2020","story":"A new tourist attraction opens in Liverpool, including an “upside down room” and a mirror maze.David Rose for the Daily Iran missile attacks: Iran \u0026#39aiming to miss\u0026#39 when it hit US bases in Iraq with 22 rockets, suggests Pentagon - latest newsIran plane crash: Ukraine refuses to rule out Boeing 737 was shot down by missile near Tehran killing 176Exclusive: Killer of Helen McCourt to be released as parole board rejects Justice Secretary\u0026#39s appeal for rethinkBrigitte Macron launches first major public role at hospital charity as husband faces ire of French doctorsKeir Starmer: the high-flying law man desperate to stress his working class credentialsFrance\u0026#39s national police chief resigns amid reports he is \u0026#39washed out\u0026#39 from handling yellow vest revoltOttawa shooter at large after one left deadInside the koala hospital helping  animals recover from horrific burns as bushfires sweep across AustraliaComment: How should Britain react to the escalating crisis in Iran?\tIran plane crash analysis: What happened mid-air and who has the black box?Uber driver cleared of a sword attack on police outside Buckingham Palace planned a terror attack on tourists in LondonComment: Unless Labour learns the Tory virtue of ruthlessness, it will continue to be led by failures and liabilitiesSign up for royal fashion WhatsApp updates direct to your phone during the royal tourIran plane crash: British newlywed was only on doomed flight because he stayed in Tehran to prolong wedding celebrationsIran fires 22 missiles at US targets in Iraq in retaliation for killing of Qassim Soleimani We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/12/30/22/plastic-waste-ocean.jpg","title":"20 pledges 2020 climate change","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.None of us is perfect, so there’s no use virtue-signalling or preachingHow much can any one of us do to make a difference in the climate crisis? We all know the fatalistic logic: the real power lies with the governments of countries such as China, or with the banks that fund the oil industry. What can you or I really achieve with our reusable coffee cups and vegan sausage rolls, other than occupying a rather smug patch of moral high ground, or worse still, creating a comforting illusion that masks the real problem?But there is another point of view. If we take the climate crisis seriously, how can we not want to try, even in some small way, to be part of the solution? Can we really expect the countries and companies that produce the most carbon to change if we don’t show willing to make some small sacrifice in our own lives? And if we all do something, won’t governments and corporations be encouraged to reflect the wishes of the people, even if they are motivated just by winning our votes and taking our money?I’ve sensed this urge to do something while speaking to colleagues recently. And it’s the desire to contribute that has prompted us to create this series of blogs, under the banner “20 Pledges for 2020”. It started on the Lifestyle desk. Did I know, asked one of our staff, that our deputy travel editor was going flight-free for a year? For someone who must receive more invitations for all-expenses-paid trips to the sun than anyone I can name, this was no casual commitment. Then I heard there was a colleague who’s going vegan, and another determined to switch to an electric car. And so the list went on.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe’re not immune to the bigger challenges and responsibilities of the media. During our recent coverage of the UK general election, we set out to make climate the most important theme for our coverage. Looking back, we led our site and our Daily Edition app on climate issues more than any other major British publisher over the same period – no small achievement – but I can’t say we managed to make it our number-one subject it was perhaps inevitable that the NHS and Brexit dominated the political agenda even on our pages. So one of the blogs you’ll see starting over the next few weeks will be from our politics team, pledging to hold politicians to account over the climate.As for me, I’ll be blogging about how The Independent can use its reach and influence to help fight the climate crisis. This was a challenge set for me directly by our environment columnist Donnachadh McCarthy, who is also part of the media team of Extinction Rebellion. I had always been confident that The Independent was not part of the problem. I’m proud to have worked here at the time when Michael McCarthy, our former environment editor, and the late Steve Connor, our science editor, helped to blaze a trail with their reporting and analysis. The natural world was not always such a fashionable cause back then, but you knew they were on to something from the level of pushback we received – even if sometimes it was impossible not to chuckle along.Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

It’s not like we’re The Independent, we can’t just stick a headline saying ‘Cruelty’ and then stick a picture of a dolphin or a whale underneath it. I mean, that’s just cheating, that’s rubbish.” (With apologies to real fans, I’ve filtered out the fruitier adjectives.) It’s amazing to think how recently such large parts of the media were sceptical towards “climate zealots”, and still are.But Donnachadh put a challenge to me a few months ago: when you look at the Indy, is it really clear that we’re living through a crisis? Couldn’t we be doing more? He was right, of course, and we will do more, so I’ll be blogging to keep you up to date with the changes we’re making.There are three phases to climate journalism as far as I can see. First, journalists had a job to do to convince sceptics that the science is right: mankind’s use of fossil fuels is heating our planet. Then there was the second phase: how fast was the world warming, can we limit the rise to 1.5 degrees, 3 degrees, or more? That’s still a crucial debate, and a subject we will continue to track. But the 20 Pledges blogs belong to a third phase: what exactly are we going to do about it – from government policy, financial regulation and international treaties to our own compromises and choices?Before someone helpfully points out the obvious, I realise that none of us writing these blogs is perfect. I’ll start by holding my hand up: for one thing, I fly from our London office to see our US-based staff, just as our reporters often take flights to report on stories around the world, so I’ll be writing more about that in a future blog post.But this project is not about pretending to be perfect, or virtue-signalling, or being diabolically hypocritical, and we certainly aren’t setting out to preach (there’s enough climate puritanism online already). If, or when, we slip up along the way – when the trip to review a new hotel is too tempting, if the smell of a bacon sandwich catches us at a moment of weakness – we’ll write about those times too. So what are we hoping for? We hope it gives us a richer perspective on some of the more important climate stories we cover in 2020, and that by sharing our own experiences we might encourage others to share theirs too. We’ll try to use our voice to encourage change from governments too.You may want to make a pledge yourself and write a blog through the year about it with us, in which case please do get in touch. You can email all of us writing these blogs at 20pledges@, and you’ll find all the blogs, running through the year, appearing at www.news20-pledges.Your pledge may not exactly change the world by itself, but if you share your story, you never know whose mind you might change along the way.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra’, says Will KirbyOut-and-out epiphanies are rare occurrences, but as I stood with my face deeply embedded in the armpit of a complete stranger in the early hours of the morning for the third time that week, I had the strangest feeling that I was, in fact, done with commuting on the Tube.There were other signs of course – like being kneecapped by the men in suits desperate to get onto the train before anyone has got off, or the passive-aggressive call to ‘move down please!’ at every stop as I consider how I could possibly make all 6ft of myself any smaller to allow for more space, or the unrecognisable smells that could honestly be anything from last night’s takeaway to this morning’s missed shower, or being late because of another series of red signals, or the 37 suitcases I had to negotiate because someone’s decided to move house, or looking at my bank balance and realising these joys are costing me more than £40 a week. I don’t know. But whatever it was, I realised then and there that I needed to find another way to get to work.\u0026nbspSo I did some investigating. A commute can make or break your day so it’s important to get it right. Walking was an option (healthy, free) but would have taken almost two hours each way, which would mean spending more than 12 hours a day either going from, to, or being at the office. I could jog, but, sadly, I hate jogging. The bus is doable, and a cheaper option than the Tube, but would involve three separate buses that aren’t very reliable. Which leaves me with one option. The bike.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeven things no-one tells you when you start cycling to workInitially I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to join the fluorescent, Lyrca-clad hordes that zoom around the capital at breakneck speeds. I’d never really ridden a road bike before, let alone had an argument with a car or a bus about who’s on whose side of the road. How was I going to fit in if I’d never even owned a pair of mirrored sunglasses and didn’t really know what Strava was?! But it didn’t take long to realise that there are some massive benefits that outweigh any nerves or doubts about taking to the road on two wheels.Firstly, it’s healthy. Even a short cycle at the start and end of the day is exercise you probably wouldn’t otherwise have done, and it makes so much more sense to combine your fitness with your commute rather than trying to carve a slice out of your day to go to the gym. It also makes you feel good – if you take a look around the office first thing in the morning, it’s easy to spot the bright faces who’ve biked into work in amongst those who spent at least part of their morning under the ground.\u0026nbspIt is also better for the environment. Public transport, for its many faults (see above), is certainly greener than driving myself to work every morning, but there’s only so long you can tell yourself it doesn’t have a carbon footprint. Transport for London uses more electricity than anything else in the city, consuming enough power to fuel around 360,000 homes each year. By ditching my Oyster, I can hopefully shed with it that last ounce of green guilt.\u0026nbspWhy I\u0027ve pledged to go flight-free for a yearWhy I\u0027m going vegan for 2020This year I pledge to buy local and eat with the seasonsAnd I may as well do what I can to reduce pollution in the city where I live, even if it is on an inidual scale. A recent study found the capital’s poor air quality leads to around 1,000 hospital admissions for asthma and serious lung conditions every year, and another revealed that around four Londoners are hospitalised every day due to asthma caused by air pollution. Breathing London air is like smoking 160 cigarettes a year, according to the British Heart Foundation, and when you then consider that pollution on the Tube is around 15 times worse than above ground, it’s got to be a good idea to spend as little time down there as you can.\u0026nbspThe combination of a bit of light exercise and avoiding the toxic fumes that swirl around beneath the capital also reduces the chance of a heart attack and other cardiovascular diseases. In fact, if the same number of trips were made by bike as they are in Denmark (26 per cent of all trips that are less than 5km), it could save the NHS a staggering £17 billion within 20 years.So, I’m going to give it a go. At best, I’ll get fit, rediscover a long-lost hobby and do my bit to tackle the growing climate crisis. At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra. I’ll keep you posted.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s almost one a week. Let that sink in for a moment.It wasn’t done intentionally – but, perhaps even worse, completely obliviously. Every other weekend, off I trotted, to Moscow, Doha, Rome and the rest, usually for no more than a weekend at a time. I could say that I excused my high flying lifestyle – pun very much intended – by arguing that it was all for work. With the best will in the world, being a travel journalist was always going to involve a certain amount of travel.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut, sadly, that would be giving me way too much credit. The truth is, I didn’t excuse it at all. It never even crossed my mind that I needed to.\u0026nbspUntil, of course, a previously unimaginable and unprecedented shift in the public perception of flying started to emerge. The first time I really realised that a sea change was coming was Emma Thompson’s much-publicised fall from grace, when she flew 5,400 miles from LA to London in the spring to participate in the Extinction Rebellion demonstrations that were bringing the capital to a standstill. The actor and activist was pilloried by the Right and Left in equal measure (the former labelling her a hypocrite, the latter asserting they didn’t need her carbon-tainted help, thank you very much).Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

What was the big deal? She was using her platform to add clout to a much-needed protest demanding action on the coming climate crisis. Surely that was a good thing?It wasn’t long afterwards that I heard of the flygskam (flight shame) and tågskryt (train brag) movements for the first time. Originating in Sweden and publicised by high-profile figures including Olympic athlete Bjorn Ferry and opera singer Malena Ernman, mother of teenage activist Greta Thunberg, the idea was to make the notion of flying something a little unsavoury – something you might not want to admit to doing in polite company. On the flip side, the “train brag” movement is all about celebrating rail travel, with participants posting pictures and videos of their beauty-filled overland journeys on social media.Meet the people who’ve given up flyingThe concept has even made its way over the North Sea, as I discovered when I came across the Flight Free UK movement. Founder Anna Hughes’ original aim was to get 100,000 people to sign up and pledge to stay grounded for a whole year.\u0026nbsp“I haven’t flown for about 10 years,” she said, “but given the situation we’re now in, I felt like it wasn’t enough to reduce my own carbon footprint – I needed to open it up and do more. And it took over my life!”I didn’t really expect to be joining the swelling ranks of do-gooders, to be perfectly honest. As journalists, we can easily become accomplished fantasists, convincing ourselves that we are somehow set apart from reality – here to observe and report, rather than participate.But something changed in me after I spoke to Anna, along with a number of other committed non-flyers. They were, to a fault, impassioned and persuasive yet polite and non-judgemental. They were happy to take on huge personal expense and inconvenience, all in the hopes that it might help save the only habitable planet we’ve got. A seed was planted in my brain which grew – slowly but unstoppably – day by day, and has already led to me significantly cutting down on the number\u0026nbspof flights I took in the latter half of 2019.Now, it’s time to take the next step: a year of keeping both feet on the ground. Far from being some po-faced exercise in restraint, more than anything I hope this experience will prove that travel, in all its adventurous, erse and mind-opening glory, is not only possible with clipped wings, but can even be enhanced by taking it slow.I produced somewhere in the region of 6,000kg of CO2 from flying in 2019.

A lively debate on social media, which included Piers Morgan labelling the bakery chain “PC-ravaged clowns”, ensured the new product was a hit.\u0026nbspGreggs\u0026nbspwill no doubt be hoping that the new meat-free steak bake, launched last week, also becomes a customer favourite.While\u0026nbspthe vegan launches have generated huge interest from consumers, Greggs’\u0026nbspfortunes have been buoyed by a broader strategy of transforming itself from a traditional bakery into a more modern food-to-go chain, offering a range of products including salads and coffee.Like-for-like sales jumped 9.2 per cent in 2019, Greggs revealed\u0026nbspas it upgraded its profit guidance for the third time in two months. The announcement comes after shareholders banked a £35m special idend in October thanks to the company’s better-than-expected performance.We tested Gregg’s new vegan steak bake and this is what it’s likeUnderlying pre-tax profit for the year will still be ahead of expectations\u0026nbspeven after the £7m staff bonus, Greggs said.“I am delighted to announce that we will also be making a special additional payment to all of our colleagues across the business who have worked so hard to deliver this success in what has been a phenomenal year,” chief executive Roger Whiteside said on Wednesday.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Veganuary becomes bigger every year, but it needn\u0027t be just for Janaury as these cookbooks make it easy and accessible. Words by Stacey Smith213 ‘Rachel Ama’s Vegan Eats: Tasty plant-based recipes for every day’ by Rachel Ama. Published by Ebury Press: £12.87, AmazonSince launching her vegan YouTube channel in 2017, Rachel has gained a heap of hungry followers who lap up her simple, delicious recipes (and the dance moves that go along with them). Dishes are often one-pot, can be prepped ahead, and most include a song recommendation so you can dance along as you cook. Within these pages, you’ll find plenty of meals inspired by Ama’s Caribbean and West African roots – from crispy jerk barbecue tacos or ackee “saltfish” with dumplings to peanut stew. Although this is really a celebration of all cultures – and with vegan takes on everything from Thai green curry to creamy cashew and vegetable no-pasta lasagne, we’re pretty confident you’ll find your favourite comfort dish has been given a plant-based makeover. With most ingredients easy to obtain and meals quick to put together, this is modern cooking, for the meat-shunning millennial. 313 ‘BOSH! Healthy Vegan’ by Henry Firth \u0026amp Ian Theasby. Published by HQ: £10.87, AmazonWorking with a registered dietician to ensure recipes follow trusted NHS guidelines, the BOSH! boys (aka, Henry and Ian) have bought us their healthiest cookbook to date. Recognising that just because a plate of food is vegan, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s healthy (vegan junk food certainly exists!), this is a collection of 80 new recipes showcasing their flavoursome vegan food with a healthier focus. Along with advice on sleep, movement and relaxing, there’s guidance on ensuring you get all the nutrients you need. And although the boys insist this isn’t a diet book, you’ll find recipes to help you reduce fat, build muscle and generally be a bit healthier. So whether you’re looking to up your protein intake (try the ultimate veg tacos), reduce your sugar intake with a summer-berry granola bowl or keep your calorie intake to under 500 per portion with puttanesca potato stew, you should be left feeling suitably inspired to kick start the new year.413 ‘Happy Vegan: Easy plant-based recipes to make the whole family happy’ by Fearne Cotton. Published by Seven Dials: £13.46, AmazonDespite Fearne Cotton not being a fully-fledged vegan herself (or perhaps because), this book got rave reviews from our panel, with both flexitarians, meat-eaters and vegans alike. Recipes are approachable, inexpensive and perfect for the whole family, so we can see ourselves working through them all in time. The broccoli katsu curry was a particular favourite and surprisingly easy to make and for tea time we’ll be trying our hand at her date and almond cake with caramel sauce which uses white miso paste and coconut cream to great effect.513 ‘Vegan One Pound Meals: Delicious budget-friendly plant-based recipes all for £1 per person’ by Miguel Barclay. Published by Headline Home: £10.75, AmazonIf ever there’s a time we feel the pinch, it’s January, with the festivities of Christmas long behind us but the credit card still to pay. Thankfully eating a plant-based diet could be the answer and in this book, you’ll find over 85 recipes all coming in at a frankly unbelievable £1 a portion. Our concerns that we’d be living off of beans on toast were quickly alleviated as we tucked into black bean meatballs and sticky aubergine bao. Full-flavoured, quick and easy, we couldn’t really ask for more.613 ‘Incredible Plant-Based Desserts: Colorful Vegan Cakes, Cookies, Tarts, and other Epic Delights’ by Anthea Cheng. Published by Quarry Books: £11.89, AmazonCalling all sweet-tooths! This collection of recipes from Australian blogger Anthea Cheng is celebratory food for the keen baker. You certainly couldn’t call dried rainbow pear slices convenient, quick or easy to make, however the impact they have when used to decorate her chai cake is truly show-stopping. If that all sounds a little intimidating, we found the Snack Time chapter much more manageable, with the likes of bliss balls, chocolate cups and cookies vying for attention, as well as Instagrammable breakfast bowls, beautifully presented with nut butters, granola and oats.713 ‘Dirty Vegan Another Bite’ by Matt Pritchard, published by Octopus Books: £20, Octopus BooksAfter 10 years of hard partying finally caught up with him, Matt decided to switch from the crazy pranks of MTV’s Dirty Sanchez to fitness – and is now a completely vegan endurance athlete. Believing a natural diet is key, Matt’s second cookbook is brimming with recipes full of veggies and largely focuses on un-processed ingredients (keeping the vegan cheese or meat-substitutes to a minimum). Some of Pritchard’s favourites include roasting tin laksa, sticky tofu bao buns and rhubarb and custard doughnuts. If you’re yet to convince your pal\u0027s that veganism is the way forward, we reckon the Dinner with Mates chapter will convert a few of them, with all the recipes you need to create a Mexican feast, a perfect picnic, a banging BBQ or a cracking Christmas spread. All in all we found recipes really varied, with us ear-marking nearly all of them to try at once.813 ‘5 Ingredient Vegan’ by Katy Beskow. Published by Quadrille: £12.08, AmazonLet’s face it, at the end of a long day the last thing any of us want to be doing – whether we’re following a plant-based diet or not – is trying to track down long lists of hard to find ingredients. This is the fourth book from the award-winning cook, writer and cookery tutor Katy Beskow and follows a similar simplified format, with each recipe requiring just five ingredients. Chapters include soups, lunches suppers, sweets and basics, with recipes beautifully laid out and gorgeous photography accompanying each one. Far from being basic, we were amazed to see we could create a beautiful Mediterranean briam (a layered courgette, potato and red onion bake from Greece) which was as delicious hot with crusty bread as it was cold for lunch the next day.913 ‘Zaika: Vegan recipes from India’ by Romy Gill. Published by Seven Dials : £10, AmazonGrowing up in a small town in West Bengal, India, very few people, including Romy Gill’s own family, ate meat regularly. It’s this home-cooked vegan food of her childhood that the chef and food writer wanted to share with us through her debut cookbook Zaika – meaning taste, or flavour. There’s an entire section dedicated to bread, including gram flour turmeric pancakes which are perfect with chutneys, a variety of rotis and parathas and light naan bread with nigella seeds. The Light \u0026amp Breezy chapter is all about showcasing the freshest ingredients – think watermelon and mint salad while the Warming the Heart chapter is where you’ll find hearty comfort food such as spicy red lentil dahl. The section we most fell for though was Labours of Love for when you’ve got time to really get lost in the kitchen – rich, creamy and so warming, we recommend the Baingan masala with baby aubergines, dill and coconut.1013 ‘Rebel Recipes: Maximum flavour, minimum fuss: the ultimate in vegan food’ by Niki Webster. Published by Bloomsbury: £18, AmazonThe debut book from award-winning blogger and food consultant Nikki Webster shares the same ethos as her blog Rebel Recipes – that healthy food needn’t be boring or lacking in flavour. Taking inspiration from around the globe, you could never accuse these recipes of being dull. If only we could start every day with creamy spiced coconut porridge and sticky sesame banana! Instead of relying on stale vegan ingredients and recipes – this is new-school vegan cuisine for those seeking full flavours. Although despite this, recipes were easy to follow and largely uncomplicated – with lots of spicy curries, pulses, flatbreads, salads, dips and pickles making an appearance. With mouth-watering photography throughout, the Can’t Believe It’s Vegan Desserts chapter is a particular highlight, with the likes of chocolate ganache tart, easy espresso martini pots and lemon curd and thyme tart. 1113 ‘Green: Veggie and vegan meals for no-fuss weeks and relaxed weekends’ by Elly Pear (Curshen). Published by Ebury Press: £14.99, AmazonWhile this title isn’t 100 per cent vegan, half of the book is made up of plant-based recipes so we felt it was still well worth including. Acknowledging that most of us have more time to experiment in the kitchen at the weekend yet need dinner on the table pronto mid-week, Elly Pear’s book separates dishes accordingly. We’re very keen to incorporate more Sunday night batch-cooking into our weekly routine, in order to eat better later in the week and with tray bakes, one-pot wonders and freeze-able options, this will keep us suitably inspired.1213 ‘Vegan (ish): 100 simple, budget recipes that don\u0027t cost the earth’ by Jack Monroe. Published by Bluebird: £10.66, AmazonDon’t be fooled by the title, every one of the 100 recipes within this book is completely vegan. The “ish” comes from Jack Monroe’s belief that if we were all to incorporate a few more plant-based meals into our diet each week, we’d be better off both environmentally and financially. So you needn’t be a full-time vegan to appreciate the practical, inexpensive solutions within this book. Although perhaps not the sexiest food chapter to ever be written – the whole section on sandwiches was inherently helpful for midweek meal inspiration (especially when you consider the “standard” fillings of cheese, ham, tuna, etc obviously aren’t vegan). In true Jack Monroe style, we loved the no-nonsense, easy to follow recipes and believe we’ll turn to this cookbook on a regular basis. 1313 ‘7 Day Vegan Challenge’ by Bettina Campolucci-Bordi. Published by Hardie Grant: £9.72, WorderyIf you’re tempted to give this vegan thing a whirl but you really don’t know where to start, the 7 Day Vegan Challenge is here to help. There are three menu plans to choose from complete with shopping lists: The Easy Peasy Way (quick meals for those that don’t mind repeating some dishes), For the Planners (which requires a Sunday night batch-cooking session) and Fast \u0026amp Fresh (quick and simple recipes). So a typical weekday might look like, banoffee oats for breakfast, a convincing vegan take on the classic BLT sandwich for lunch and creamy satay noodles with salt and pepper fried tofu for tea.Veganuary becomes bigger every year, but it needn\u0027t be just for Janaury as these cookbooks make it easy and accessible.

This was the largest increase since February 2018, and up from 2.1 per cent in November.”Mr Archer added: “It is possible that house prices got a boost in November and December from some buyers keen to get their move done before the general election to avoid any shocks or uncertainties that could arise.”However, he warned: “It should also be borne in mind that the Halifax measure tends to give higher house price readings than other measures.”House prices slump to seven-year low“Looking ahead, we expect uncertainty in the economy to ease somewhat in 2020, which should see transaction volumes increase and further price growth made possible by an improvement in households\u0027 real incomes.“Longer-term issues, such as the shortage of homes for sale and low levels of house-building, will continue to limit supply, while the ongoing challenges faced by prospective buyers in raising deposits will serve to constrain demand.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They are telling us they’re enjoying the work they do but that they’re still looking for a new job, because something is missing.“Six years into our job exodus research, we’re still hearing that people want to be told ‘thank you’ and one in four people are looking for a new job because they don’t feel valued.“‘Thank you’, something so simple, so consistently important and potentially the best retention tool we’ve got.”Investors in People suggested a number of ways to improve staff wellbeing, reduce stress and increase job satisfaction.A friendly workplace and a supportive culture were cited as the key ingredients to retaining employees. More than half of survey respondents said that having friends at work is important to them, while a quarter admits to staying in a position because of friendships rather than the job.Nearly half (47 per cent) said they would rather have a friendly workplace than a 3 per cent pay rise.British workers put in among the longest hours in the EU, according to separate research by the TUC.The union organisation found that the average full-time week in Britain has shortened by 18 minutes over the past decade, and at the current rate of progress, it would take 63 years for workers to get the same amount of free time as elsewhere in Europe.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This revision took it above November’s reading of 49.3.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Any improvement in the sector’s fortune is of course welcome, but this small improvement to the ‘no change’ mark means stagnation is also a possibility,” said Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply (CIPS), which\u0026nbsppublished the report.“Other clouds of uncertainty must also include the potential for further political instability as negotiators and policymakers take the next steps.”Created with Sketch.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.The survey’s finding did offer hope for stronger output in 2020. The forward-looking business expectations index was the highest since September 2018.“The modest rebound in new work provides another signal that business conditions should begin to improve in the coming months, helped by a boost to business sentiment from greater Brexit clarity and a more predictable political landscape,” said Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit, which compiled the survey.Economists said that investors would now be looking for confirmation of a post-election boost in data to be published this month. Thomas Pugh, UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said markets would be looking at the “flash” estimates of output from the construction manufacturing and services sector on 17 January to see whether it might stop the Bank of England from cutting interest rates.Top FTSE 100 bosses will earn more than average worker by 5pm today“If this post-election bounce is repeated in other data … then it will probably be enough to prevent more Monetary Policy Committee members from voting for a rate cut,” Mr Pugh said. “But if there isn’t an uplift in the data over the next few months, then the MPC may step in to support the economy.”However, any upturn comes against an anaemic background. The seasonally adjusted composite index of all sectors registered 49.3 in December, unchanged from that seen in November and\u0026nbspthe joint-lowest since July 2016.The stabilisation of service sector activity in Monday’s figures was offset by a sharp and accelerated decline in manufacturing output to 45.6.Economists are not expecting a cut in governor Mark Carney’s final meeting\u0026nbspthis month, with the financial markets only pricing in a 10 per cent chance of a move. However, the odds of a rate move by August rise to evens.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is because they are treated favourably and have more privileges,” the Ofsted report said. “Some of the girls told us that they do not like this. They said that this was not fair and feel disadvantaged.”Inspectors visited the school in November and concluded its unlawful segregation of pupils by sex is having a “negative impact” on girls’ education and self-confidence.It comes after the Court of Appeal concluded in 2017 that an Islamic faith school’s policy of segregating boys from girls was unlawful sex discrimination.Ofsted had placed the mixed-sex Al-Hijrah school in Birmingham into special measures in 2016 after it claimed iding classes was discriminatory.Saadat Rasool, headteacher of\u0026nbspRedstone\u0026nbspAcademy, has said it has no intention of defying the law in any way.He said: “We believe the idea that boys are ‘given favourable treatment and more opportunities than girls’ is just not accurate as all the previous Ofsted reports have noted that provision for boys and girls has been equal and fair.“We work very diligently to offer the best to both boys and girls at our school – and both are given equal opportunities to be successful in whatever they choose.”​Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A lively debate on social media, which included Piers Morgan labelling the bakery chain “PC-ravaged clowns”, ensured the new product was a hit.\u0026nbspGreggs\u0026nbspwill no doubt be hoping that the new meat-free steak bake, launched last week, also becomes a customer favourite.While\u0026nbspthe vegan launches have generated huge interest from consumers, Greggs’\u0026nbspfortunes have been buoyed by a broader strategy of transforming itself from a traditional bakery into a more modern food-to-go chain, offering a range of products including salads and coffee.Like-for-like sales jumped 9.2 per cent in 2019, Greggs revealed\u0026nbspas it upgraded its profit guidance for the third time in two months. The announcement comes after shareholders banked a £35m special idend in October thanks to the company’s better-than-expected performance.We tested Gregg’s new vegan steak bake and this is what it’s likeUnderlying pre-tax profit for the year will still be ahead of expectations\u0026nbspeven after the £7m staff bonus, Greggs said.“I am delighted to announce that we will also be making a special additional payment to all of our colleagues across the business who have worked so hard to deliver this success in what has been a phenomenal year,” chief executive Roger Whiteside said on Wednesday.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Like-for-like sales, which strip\u0026nbspout the effect of shop openings and closures, were up 9.2 per cent.“Looking to the year ahead, we face strong sales comparatives and cost inflation headwinds present a challenge,” Mr Whiteside said.Created with Sketch. Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Veganuary becomes bigger every year, but it needn\u0027t be just for Janaury as these cookbooks make it easy and accessible. Words by Stacey Smith213 ‘Rachel Ama’s Vegan Eats: Tasty plant-based recipes for every day’ by Rachel Ama. Published by Ebury Press: £12.87, AmazonSince launching her vegan YouTube channel in 2017, Rachel has gained a heap of hungry followers who lap up her simple, delicious recipes (and the dance moves that go along with them). Dishes are often one-pot, can be prepped ahead, and most include a song recommendation so you can dance along as you cook. Within these pages, you’ll find plenty of meals inspired by Ama’s Caribbean and West African roots – from crispy jerk barbecue tacos or ackee “saltfish” with dumplings to peanut stew. Although this is really a celebration of all cultures – and with vegan takes on everything from Thai green curry to creamy cashew and vegetable no-pasta lasagne, we’re pretty confident you’ll find your favourite comfort dish has been given a plant-based makeover. With most ingredients easy to obtain and meals quick to put together, this is modern cooking, for the meat-shunning millennial. 313 ‘BOSH! Healthy Vegan’ by Henry Firth \u0026amp Ian Theasby. Published by HQ: £10.87, AmazonWorking with a registered dietician to ensure recipes follow trusted NHS guidelines, the BOSH! boys (aka, Henry and Ian) have bought us their healthiest cookbook to date. Recognising that just because a plate of food is vegan, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s healthy (vegan junk food certainly exists!), this is a collection of 80 new recipes showcasing their flavoursome vegan food with a healthier focus. Along with advice on sleep, movement and relaxing, there’s guidance on ensuring you get all the nutrients you need. And although the boys insist this isn’t a diet book, you’ll find recipes to help you reduce fat, build muscle and generally be a bit healthier. So whether you’re looking to up your protein intake (try the ultimate veg tacos), reduce your sugar intake with a summer-berry granola bowl or keep your calorie intake to under 500 per portion with puttanesca potato stew, you should be left feeling suitably inspired to kick start the new year.413 ‘Happy Vegan: Easy plant-based recipes to make the whole family happy’ by Fearne Cotton. Published by Seven Dials: £13.46, AmazonDespite Fearne Cotton not being a fully-fledged vegan herself (or perhaps because), this book got rave reviews from our panel, with both flexitarians, meat-eaters and vegans alike. Recipes are approachable, inexpensive and perfect for the whole family, so we can see ourselves working through them all in time. The broccoli katsu curry was a particular favourite and surprisingly easy to make and for tea time we’ll be trying our hand at her date and almond cake with caramel sauce which uses white miso paste and coconut cream to great effect.513 ‘Vegan One Pound Meals: Delicious budget-friendly plant-based recipes all for £1 per person’ by Miguel Barclay. Published by Headline Home: £10.75, AmazonIf ever there’s a time we feel the pinch, it’s January, with the festivities of Christmas long behind us but the credit card still to pay. Thankfully eating a plant-based diet could be the answer and in this book, you’ll find over 85 recipes all coming in at a frankly unbelievable £1 a portion. Our concerns that we’d be living off of beans on toast were quickly alleviated as we tucked into black bean meatballs and sticky aubergine bao. Full-flavoured, quick and easy, we couldn’t really ask for more.613 ‘Incredible Plant-Based Desserts: Colorful Vegan Cakes, Cookies, Tarts, and other Epic Delights’ by Anthea Cheng. Published by Quarry Books: £11.89, AmazonCalling all sweet-tooths! This collection of recipes from Australian blogger Anthea Cheng is celebratory food for the keen baker. You certainly couldn’t call dried rainbow pear slices convenient, quick or easy to make, however the impact they have when used to decorate her chai cake is truly show-stopping. If that all sounds a little intimidating, we found the Snack Time chapter much more manageable, with the likes of bliss balls, chocolate cups and cookies vying for attention, as well as Instagrammable breakfast bowls, beautifully presented with nut butters, granola and oats.713 ‘Dirty Vegan Another Bite’ by Matt Pritchard, published by Octopus Books: £20, Octopus BooksAfter 10 years of hard partying finally caught up with him, Matt decided to switch from the crazy pranks of MTV’s Dirty Sanchez to fitness – and is now a completely vegan endurance athlete. Believing a natural diet is key, Matt’s second cookbook is brimming with recipes full of veggies and largely focuses on un-processed ingredients (keeping the vegan cheese or meat-substitutes to a minimum). Some of Pritchard’s favourites include roasting tin laksa, sticky tofu bao buns and rhubarb and custard doughnuts. If you’re yet to convince your pal\u0027s that veganism is the way forward, we reckon the Dinner with Mates chapter will convert a few of them, with all the recipes you need to create a Mexican feast, a perfect picnic, a banging BBQ or a cracking Christmas spread. All in all we found recipes really varied, with us ear-marking nearly all of them to try at once.813 ‘5 Ingredient Vegan’ by Katy Beskow. Published by Quadrille: £12.08, AmazonLet’s face it, at the end of a long day the last thing any of us want to be doing – whether we’re following a plant-based diet or not – is trying to track down long lists of hard to find ingredients. This is the fourth book from the award-winning cook, writer and cookery tutor Katy Beskow and follows a similar simplified format, with each recipe requiring just five ingredients. Chapters include soups, lunches suppers, sweets and basics, with recipes beautifully laid out and gorgeous photography accompanying each one. Far from being basic, we were amazed to see we could create a beautiful Mediterranean briam (a layered courgette, potato and red onion bake from Greece) which was as delicious hot with crusty bread as it was cold for lunch the next day.913 ‘Zaika: Vegan recipes from India’ by Romy Gill. Published by Seven Dials : £10, AmazonGrowing up in a small town in West Bengal, India, very few people, including Romy Gill’s own family, ate meat regularly. It’s this home-cooked vegan food of her childhood that the chef and food writer wanted to share with us through her debut cookbook Zaika – meaning taste, or flavour. There’s an entire section dedicated to bread, including gram flour turmeric pancakes which are perfect with chutneys, a variety of rotis and parathas and light naan bread with nigella seeds. The Light \u0026amp Breezy chapter is all about showcasing the freshest ingredients – think watermelon and mint salad while the Warming the Heart chapter is where you’ll find hearty comfort food such as spicy red lentil dahl. The section we most fell for though was Labours of Love for when you’ve got time to really get lost in the kitchen – rich, creamy and so warming, we recommend the Baingan masala with baby aubergines, dill and coconut.1013 ‘Rebel Recipes: Maximum flavour, minimum fuss: the ultimate in vegan food’ by Niki Webster. Published by Bloomsbury: £18, AmazonThe debut book from award-winning blogger and food consultant Nikki Webster shares the same ethos as her blog Rebel Recipes – that healthy food needn’t be boring or lacking in flavour. Taking inspiration from around the globe, you could never accuse these recipes of being dull. If only we could start every day with creamy spiced coconut porridge and sticky sesame banana! Instead of relying on stale vegan ingredients and recipes – this is new-school vegan cuisine for those seeking full flavours. Although despite this, recipes were easy to follow and largely uncomplicated – with lots of spicy curries, pulses, flatbreads, salads, dips and pickles making an appearance. With mouth-watering photography throughout, the Can’t Believe It’s Vegan Desserts chapter is a particular highlight, with the likes of chocolate ganache tart, easy espresso martini pots and lemon curd and thyme tart. 1113 ‘Green: Veggie and vegan meals for no-fuss weeks and relaxed weekends’ by Elly Pear (Curshen). Published by Ebury Press: £14.99, AmazonWhile this title isn’t 100 per cent vegan, half of the book is made up of plant-based recipes so we felt it was still well worth including. Acknowledging that most of us have more time to experiment in the kitchen at the weekend yet need dinner on the table pronto mid-week, Elly Pear’s book separates dishes accordingly. We’re very keen to incorporate more Sunday night batch-cooking into our weekly routine, in order to eat better later in the week and with tray bakes, one-pot wonders and freeze-able options, this will keep us suitably inspired.1213 ‘Vegan (ish): 100 simple, budget recipes that don\u0027t cost the earth’ by Jack Monroe. Published by Bluebird: £10.66, AmazonDon’t be fooled by the title, every one of the 100 recipes within this book is completely vegan. The “ish” comes from Jack Monroe’s belief that if we were all to incorporate a few more plant-based meals into our diet each week, we’d be better off both environmentally and financially. So you needn’t be a full-time vegan to appreciate the practical, inexpensive solutions within this book. Although perhaps not the sexiest food chapter to ever be written – the whole section on sandwiches was inherently helpful for midweek meal inspiration (especially when you consider the “standard” fillings of cheese, ham, tuna, etc obviously aren’t vegan). In true Jack Monroe style, we loved the no-nonsense, easy to follow recipes and believe we’ll turn to this cookbook on a regular basis. 1313 ‘7 Day Vegan Challenge’ by Bettina Campolucci-Bordi. Published by Hardie Grant: £9.72, WorderyIf you’re tempted to give this vegan thing a whirl but you really don’t know where to start, the 7 Day Vegan Challenge is here to help. There are three menu plans to choose from complete with shopping lists: The Easy Peasy Way (quick meals for those that don’t mind repeating some dishes), For the Planners (which requires a Sunday night batch-cooking session) and Fast \u0026amp Fresh (quick and simple recipes). So a typical weekday might look like, banoffee oats for breakfast, a convincing vegan take on the classic BLT sandwich for lunch and creamy satay noodles with salt and pepper fried tofu for tea.Veganuary becomes bigger every year, but it needn\u0027t be just for Janaury as these cookbooks make it easy and accessible.

The company also warned that the rapidly rising cost of pork\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspthanks in part to an epidemic of swine fever in China\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspcould have an impact on business.Greggs said in October that it was stockpiling ingredients, including pork, to prepare for the potential impact of Brexit.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

of the awards race – for example, if a member was yet to see Sam Mendes’ First World War drama 1917, its unexpected win in the Best Film – Drama category at Sunday night’s ceremony would have no doubt brought that film to the top of the list.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesStill, the Golden Globes have failed to hint at eventual Oscar winners in the past – The Hurt Locker and Spotlight are two films that went on to win Best Picture but they won absolutely nothing at the Globes.The best predictions of what will be nominated for the big awards can be formulated by assessing those named by the Producers Guild (PGA), Directors Guild (DGA), Writers Guild (WGA) and the Baftas, which sparked fury for a severe lack of ersity among its nominations when announced earlier this week.Created with Sketch.Golden Globes: All the night\u0027s winners, in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Once Upon a Time in HollywoodThe cast and

nominations\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspless than a week away, below are how the odds are looking for all the films that are likely to be named by the Academy.\u0026nbspThe favourite to win may currently be Parasite, but two films that have attracted a flurry of bets following the Globes are 1917 and Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which won Best Film – Comedy or Musical. This has been a complete reversal from about a month ago, which had The Irishman and Marriage Story sitting high as favourites. Still, if Parasite should win, it’ll be the first foreign language film to do so in Oscar history, a feat that was expected to be achieved by Netflix’s Roma up until Green Book beat it in the eleventh hour.Following his win at the Golden Globes, Sam Mendes – whose war film 1917 is a two-take drama following two soldiers’ journey behind enemy lines – is now the one to beat for the prize. He previously won in 2000 for American Beauty. While mob drama The Irishman‘s Best Picture odds have somewhat drifted, director Martin Scorsese still sits high as one of the most heavily-backed filmmakers in the category alongside South Korean director Bong Joon-ho, who received a standing ovation after winning at the DGAs earlier this week.Ricky Gervais shocks Golden Globes with Leonardo DiCaprio joke Ricky Gervais draws gasps with Harvey Weinstein ‘truth bomb’Fleabag and Olivia Colman lead British winners at Golden GlobesThis is Joaquin Phoenix’s for the taking ands the odds reflect this. His controversial role in Joker has been a favourite since the film premiered at festivals last Autumn and his Golden Globe win seems to have secured his first Academy Award. Still, with a month to go, Taron Egerton could work the campaign trail to his advantage. The Rocketman star is clearly well-liked by voters and, after Rami Malek won for playing Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody, its clear music biopics are in favour among those that matter.At this stage, they may as well just give the trophy to Renée​ Zellweger. While Judy would be lucky to get nominations in any other category, it seems destined to become an Oscar-winner thanks to Zellweger’s lead role of Hollywood icon Judy Garland. Her only real competition seems to be Scarlett Johansson for her role in Marriage Story – a nomination on Monday would mark a first for the actor.This could perhaps be the most exciting – and closest – category of the night. Brad Pitt (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood) shouldn’t go celebrating yet – even if, throughout his career, Tarantino has become something of a Supporting Actor whisperer (Christoph Waltz won in this category twice of Inglorious Basterds and Django Unchained). Both Al Pacino and Joe Pesci will provide strong competition for their work in The Irishman – as will\u0026nbspSong Kang-ho, the lead star of Parasite. Still, the most money is going on Brad.Created with Sketch.The actors who’ve won the most Oscars Show all 41Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.It was the Austrian-born actor’s long-running collaboration with controversial filmmaker Quentin Tarantino that brought him to the mainstream public consciousness. In Inglourious Basterds, Waltz plays terrifying Nazi colonel Hans Landa, while in Django Unchained, he seems a world apart playing benevolent dentist-cum-bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz. Both roles were rewarded with Oscars for Best Supporting Actor.Spacey won two Oscars, for The Usual Suspects in 1996 and American Beauty in 2000. After numerous allegations of sexual assault emerged in 2017, the actor was removed from the Ridley Scott film All the Money in the World, and Christopher Plummer was given a Best Supporting Actor nomination after reshooting Spacey’s scenes in his stead.Swank won two awards for Best Actress, for Boys Don’t Cry and Million Dollar Baby. Accepting the award for the former, Swank neglected to thank her then-husband, Chad Lowe. Girls star Lena Dunham would later thank Lowe when she received a Golden Globe in 2013, tweeting that she did it “because Hilary Swank forgot.”Leigh’s performances as Scarlett O’Hara in Gone with the Wind in 1939 and as Blanche DuBois in the Tennessee Willimas adaptation A Streetcar Named Desire in 1951 stand as two of the most iconic in film history. The actress was fittingly rewarded for the roles, taking home a Best Actress trophy each time.Wiest appeared in five films by writer-director Woody Allen, winning Best Supporting Actress awards for her roles in Hannah and Her Sisters and Bullets Over Broadway. She is currently a regular on the CBS sit-com Life in Pieces.Ustinov was a highly acclaimed performer – with two Academy Awards to his name, for Spartacus and Topkapi – but was in no way limited to acting. Ustinov held a panoply of other occupations, including as a writer, a dramatist, a filmmaker, a director of theatre and opera, a humorist, a newspaper columnist, a radio broadcaster and a TV presenter. The son of a stage and silent film actor who was a victim of Hollywood’s transition to sound, Jason Robards was blessed with more success in the industry, eventually winning two Academy Awards. The actor appeared in numerous stage and screen adaptations of Eugene O’Neill plays, but it was his work in All the President’s Men that bagged him his first Best Supporting Actor statuette, doubling his tally the next year, in 1977, with Julia.Douglas won two Oscars, for Hud (1963) and for acting alongside a revelatory Peter Sellers in Being There (1969). The actor was known for being an outspoken anti-fascist ever since visiting Europe in 1931 with his wife, Helen Gahagan, who served three terms as a US Congresswoman, running against Richard Nixon for Governor in 1950.Over the course of her 63-year career, Winters appeared in successful blockbusters such as The Poseidon Adventure. But it was her more nuanced supporting roles in 1960’s The Diary of Anne Frank and 1965’s A Patch of Blue that would win over Academy voters, for which she collected two awards in the category.Quinn is something of an anomaly in the ranks of multiple Oscar-winners. The actor was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, in 1915, to a Mexican mother and an Irish father, and is one of one only five actors with a Latin-American background to win an acting Oscar – the others being Rita Moreno, José Ferrer, Mercedes Ruehl, and Benicio del Toro – and the only one to win twice. Roma nominees Yalitza Aparicio and Marina de Tavira are in contention this year.Jackson was one of the most accomplished actors of her generation, with two Best Actress wins under her belt by the age of 37 (for Women in Love and A Touch of Class). But starting in 1992, she took a 23-year sabbatical from the industry, serving as the Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn.Long before she was captivating younger audiences with her roles in the Harry Potter franchise and popular TV series Downton Abbey, Dame Maggie Smith had wowed Oscar voters with The Prime of Miss Jean Brody (1969), adding a Best Supporting Actress win for California Suite in 1978.Davis won her only two Best Actress Oscars in 1935 and 1938 – for Dangerous and Jezebel respectively –but over the course of her hugely successful six-decade career, she would continue to accrue more nominations, eventually becoming the first actor to reach a milestone of 10.Along with Helen Hayes, March is one of only two actors to win two Oscars and two Tony Awards. The multi-talented star won Best Actor for the bifurcated titular role in 1931’s horror adaptation Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, winning again in 1946 for The Best Years of Our Lives, a post-WWII drama about soldiers returning home from the war.Field’s Oscar win for Places in the Heart in 1985 has been immortalised by her acceptance speech – which included the infamous lines “you like me, right now, you really like me” - but the actor had already proven she was more than just a soundbite having won the same trophy for her star turn in Norma Rae five years earlier.Taylor gained 30 pounds for the 1966 black comedy Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, a film which sees her trapped in a poisonous marriage with a character played by her off-and-on real-life paramour Richard Burton. The star had previously nabbed a Best Actress award for her portrayal of a sex worker in BUtterfield 8, a film she claimed to dislike.After scooping up the Best Actor prize in 2003 for Mystic River, Penn won another for portraying iconic LGBT campaigner and US politician Harvey Milk, who was assassinated in 1978. Penn opened his victory speech with “Thank you. Thank you. You commie, homo-loving sons-of-guns!”Fargo Oscar-winner McDormand delivered a rousing address at the 2018 Oscar ceremony, demanding an end to Hollywood’s gender imbalance. The speech, made while accepting her second Best Actress prize - for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri - brought all the women in the audience to their feet in solidarity. She ended her speech with the phrase “inclusion rider,” a stipulation that can be put into a performer’s contract to ensure equal opportunity hiring on set.Hackman won his first Oscar playing “Popeye” Doyle in William Friedkin’s The French Connection – a taboo-busting cop thriller that was hardly the stuff of Academy tradition. 19 years later, his supporting turn as the villain in Clint Eastwood’s revisionist Western Unforgiven made it a double.Hanks made his name in romantic comedies with some successes in the 1980s, but his first Oscar win – for AIDS drama Philadelphia - was a big departure. The next year, in 1995, he won again, for the hugely popular Forrest Gump.Dame Olivia de Havilland, now 102 years old, is perhaps best known for her role in Gone with the Wind. Garnering five nominations across her career, de Havilland took home two statuettes in the 1940s, for To Each His Own and The Heiress.Next to Luise Rainer, Jodie Foster is the only other actor to have won two Oscars before the age of 30, for The Accused in 1988, and Silence of the Lambs in 1991. It’s a fitting record for an actor whose career took off while she was still a child, with breakout roles in Bugsy Malone and Taxi Driver.Sir Michael Caine, familiar around the globe for his distinctive cockney accent, once confessed that 1983’s Educating Rita was “the last good picture I made before I mentally retired.” In spite of this, the actor managed to win Oscars for Hannah and Her Sisters in 1986 and The Cider House Rules in 1999.Cooper won his first Best Actor Oscar in 1942 for Sergeant York. The famously stoic star didn’t turn up to collect his second award – for an understated turn in the classic Western High Noon – instead sending John Wayne, who said: Coop and I have been friends, hunting and fishing, for more years than I like to remember. He\u0027s one of the nicest fellows I know. I don\u0027t know anybody any nicer.”In 1982, Jessica Lange became the first star in nearly four decades to be nominated for two films in the same year, for Tootsie and Frances, the former of which yielded a win. Lange is currently tied as the sixth most nominated Actress in history.Initially winning at the same time as co-star Meryl Streep for Kramer Vs Kramer, Hoffman’s second Best Actor Oscar came for Rain Man in 1988, in a role which has been recognised as important in raising awareness of autism.The poster girl for the flower child generation, Jane Fonda was always expected to politicise the Oscars. After an unexpectedly reserved acceptance speech for Klute in 1972, she presented part of her 1979 speech – for Coming Home – in sign language.Following a supporting turn in 1974’s The Godfather Part II, Robert De Niro’s second Oscar-winning role, playing boxer Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull, is about as hard-earned as they come. The actor honed his boxing ability to professional standards, and gained approximately 60 pounds to play an older, washed-up version of the character.The Aviator is often dismissed as a minor Martin Scorsese film, but the Howard Hawks biopic won Blanchett her first Oscar in 2004. She would have to wait until Blue Jasmine seven years later - her sixth nominated performance, out of seven total - to win in the Best Actress category.Lemmon was legendary for his mastery of both comedy and pathos, and it was chiefly his humorous chops that saw him win Best Supporting Actor in 1955, for his role in Mister Roberts. With a follow-up win for Save the Tiger, the Some Like it Hot star became the first actor to claim Oscar wins in both the lead and supporting categories.Eight-time Oscar nominee Brando influenced a generation of actors with his revolutionary approaches to method, winning Hollywood’s biggest prize twice in the process - for On the Waterfront (1954) and The Godfather (1974). Brando famously sent Native American actress Sacheen Littlefeather to accept his second award in protest of the industry’s representation of Native Americans. Littlefeather later revealed the protest caused her to be blacklisted by many studios.Spencer Tracy won two Oscars from nine nominations for Best Actor. He holds the joint record for the most nominations in the category, along with Laurence Olivier, who won only once.Rainer has been described as the first victim of the so-called “Oscar curse”. The Austrian-American star won Best Actress twice in quick succession – for The Great Ziegfeld in 1936 and for The Good Earth in 1937 – which resulted in MGM studios eagerly miscasting her in a series of flops. This would lead to a 54-year break from cinema, before returning alongside Michael Gambon in 1997’s The Gambler.Helen Hayes holds the record for being the actor with the longest gap between two Oscar victories. A practiced stage actress, Hayes also appeared in a few silent films before making her debut ‘talkie’ The Sin of Madelon Claudet, for which she won Best Actress. Hayes’s next and final win would be for a supporting role in Airport, nearly 40 years later.Denzel Washington is the only black actor to win multiple competitive Academy Awards, for Glory in 1990 – a Best Supporting Actor award - and then Training Day in 2002. No African-American actor has won more than one award since, although Mahershala Ali could match his total should he win for Green Book.Brennan had originally started work as an extra after losing most of his money in the 1925 real estate slump, appearing (often uncredited) in over 120 films across the next decade. He would then win three Best Supporting Actor Oscars in the space of four years, for Come and Get It (1936), Kentucky (1938) and The Westerner (1940).Nicholson became regarded as one of the voices of his generation at the start of the 1970s with iconic roles in Easy Rider and Five Easy Pieces, but it took six nominations for him to win his first Oscar, for the Miloš Forman-directed One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest in 1976. He would later win two more, one for Terms of Endearment and the other for As Good as It Gets.Ingrid Bergman, the Swedish star who successfully crossed over to Hollywood in 1939, won three Oscars during her career, beginning with Gaslight in 1944. An extra-marital affair with director Roberto Rossellini in the early 1950s scandalised her American audience, but the success of Anastasia in 1956 brought her back into the bosom of the public favour and she won a second Best Actress trophy. She added a Supporting Actress honour in 1974 for Murder on the Orient Express, one of her last film projects.Sir Daniel Day-Lewis is the only male actor to win three Best Actor awards, for his roles in My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln. After writing himself into the annals of film history with his 2012 win for portraying the American president, Day-Lewis took a step back from the industry, appearing in only one film since – Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread - which he has claimed is his final role. For Meryl Streep, Oscar nominations are nearly as regular as dental appointments. Streep’s name has appeared on the ballot a total of 21 times, 17 of which were in the Best Actress category, and she has won three times: for Kramer vs Kramer in 1980, Sophie’s Choice in 1983, and The Iron Lady in 2012.Katharine Hepburn boasts more Oscar victories – four – than any other actor, all in the Actress in a Leading Role category. Hepburn’s The Lion in Winter trophy was shared with Barbra Streisand in the only ever instance of a tied Best Actress result. Hepburn never attended any of the ceremonies.It was the Austrian-born actor’s long-running collaboration with controversial filmmaker Quentin Tarantino that brought him to the mainstream public consciousness. In Inglourious Basterds, Waltz plays terrifying Nazi colonel Hans Landa, while in Django Unchained, he seems a world apart playing benevolent dentist-cum-bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz. Both roles were rewarded with Oscars for Best Supporting Actor.Spacey won two Oscars, for The Usual Suspects in 1996 and American Beauty in 2000.

She added a Supporting Actress honour in 1974 for Murder on the Orient Express, one of her last film projects.Sir Daniel Day-Lewis is the only male actor to win three Best Actor awards, for his roles in My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln. After writing himself into the annals of film history with his 2012 win for portraying the American president, Day-Lewis took a step back from the industry, appearing in only one film since – Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread - which he has claimed is his final role. For Meryl Streep, Oscar nominations are nearly as regular as dental appointments. Streep’s name has appeared on the ballot a total of 21 times, 17 of which were in the Best Actress category, and she has won three times: for Kramer vs Kramer in 1980, Sophie’s Choice in 1983, and The Iron Lady in 2012.Katharine Hepburn boasts more Oscar victories – four – than any other actor, all in the Actress in a Leading Role category. Hepburn’s The Lion in Winter trophy was shared with Barbra Streisand in the only ever instance of a tied Best Actress result. Hepburn never attended any of the ceremonies.There is really an upset in this category and the 2020 ceremony looks certain to be no different. According to the odds, Marriage Story‘s Laura Dern – who was last nominated in this category in 2014 for Wild – will not only be named on Monday, but will win the prize come Oscars night. Her closest competitor is said to Hustlers star Jennifer Lopez, although the fact she was shut out by Bafta doesn’t bode well for her chances.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Oscar nominations will be announced on Monday at 1pm\u0026nbspGMT with the ceremony scheduled to take place in Los Angeles on 9 February.

This could be about to change, after transport giants Daimler and Delta partnered with IBM to develop real-world applications for the nascent technology.For the Mercedes manufacturer, it could result in electric vehicle batteries capable of travelling more than 1,000km\u0026nbspwithout needing to recharge.For the world’s most valuable airline, it could mean vastly improved route scheduling, with Delta CIO Rahul\u0026nbspSamant\u0026nbspsaying the partnership with IBM would allow the airline to “draw the blueprints” for quantum computers within the\u0026nbspindustry.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesQuantum computers promise to make such advancements possible by combining the peculiar properties of quantum physics with computer science to achieve processing power that is exponentially more powerful than traditional computers.But realising this promise is still a long way off. Quantum computers were first theorised in 1982 but it took until last year for one of these machines to perform a calculation that would be impossible with a classical computer.Created with Sketch.Scientists claim to have achieved quantum supremacy Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This milestone, known as\u0026nbspquantum supremacy, was touted by the Google researchers who achieved it as “heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm” that had finally demonstrated the technologies capabilities, albeit in an extremely narrow way.“As a result of these developments, quantum computing is transitioning from a research topic to a technology that unlocks new computational capabilities,” the researchers wrote in the\u0026nbspNature\u0026nbsppaper detailing their achievement. “We are only one creative algorithm away from valuable near-term applications.”‘Quantum apocalypse’: How super computers could cripple governmentsThe hype around quantum computers means it risks becoming another tech buzzword that companies arbitrarily include to promote products, similar to the way terms like AI and blockchain have in recent years.In 2016, IBM was the first company to make quantum computers accessible via another buzzword – the cloud – meaning that computer scientists could conduct experiments and carry out research using the machines from anywhere in the world.One of the first challenges quantum computers\u0026nbspwill work on at Daimler is in improving the capacity and charge speed of batteries, referred to by IBM researchers as the Achilles Heel of electric vehicles.Next-generation lithium-sulphur batteries offer a solution to the limitations of lithium-ion batteries, which are currently used in everything from smartphones to electric cars. Theoretically, lithium-sulphur batteries are capable of holding up to five-times more energy than lithium-ion batteries, but until now they have been hugely impractical for commercial use.Daimler and IBM will use a quantum computer\u0026nbspto simulate molecules on a previously impossible scale in order to figure out a way to make this battery technology suitable for every-day use.A quantum computing breakthrough could help tackle this challenge, said Jeanette Garcia, a senior manager in the quantum applications, algorithms and theory team at IBM Research.As they improve, the machines will become exponentially more powerful. So while we haven\u0027t yet achieved quantum advantage, this type of research is the foundational work that will eventually get us there.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Now they have managed to locate another, in a nearby galaxy, taking the total to five.But they are perhaps more excited about the nature of the galaxy that is sending them out. It appears to be similar to our own, they say.Are aliens sending us messages from light years away?Identifying the host galaxy for\u0026nbspFRBs\u0026nbspis critical to tell us about what kind of environments\u0026nbspFRBs\u0026nbsplive in, and thus what might actually be producing\u0026nbspFRBs, said Sarah\u0026nbspBurke-Spolaor, assistant professor of physics and astronomy and co-author on a new paper in Nature.This is a question for which scientists are still grasping at straws.That discovery adds further mystery to the question of where FRBs are coming from. The first of the blasts came from a tiny galaxy made up of metals and newly formed stars, which led scientists to suggest they might be the result of the kind of stars found there – but that would not apply to the newly found galaxy.That means astronomers will have to consider other explanations of how FRBs\u0026nbspare generated, and might suggest there are multiple origins.The newly discovered source, named FRB ​180916,\u0026nbspis only half-a-billion light years from Earth and much nearer than other bursts that have been found in the past. It is seven times closer than the only other repeating burst that has been tracked down.That could allow for further study of the burst that could give further clues about where the bursts are coming from, scientists said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This was the largest increase since February 2018, and up from 2.1 per cent in November.”Mr Archer added: “It is possible that house prices got a boost in November and December from some buyers keen to get their move done before the general election to avoid any shocks or uncertainties that could arise.”However, he warned: “It should also be borne in mind that the Halifax measure tends to give higher house price readings than other measures.”House prices slump to seven-year low“Looking ahead, we expect uncertainty in the economy to ease somewhat in 2020, which should see transaction volumes increase and further price growth made possible by an improvement in households\u0027 real incomes.“Longer-term issues, such as the shortage of homes for sale and low levels of house-building, will continue to limit supply, while the ongoing challenges faced by prospective buyers in raising deposits will serve to constrain demand.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They are telling us they’re enjoying the work they do but that they’re still looking for a new job, because something is missing.“Six years into our job exodus research, we’re still hearing that people want to be told ‘thank you’ and one in four people are looking for a new job because they don’t feel valued.“‘Thank you’, something so simple, so consistently important and potentially the best retention tool we’ve got.”Investors in People suggested a number of ways to improve staff wellbeing, reduce stress and increase job satisfaction.A friendly workplace and a supportive culture were cited as the key ingredients to retaining employees. More than half of survey respondents said that having friends at work is important to them, while a quarter admits to staying in a position because of friendships rather than the job.Nearly half (47 per cent) said they would rather have a friendly workplace than a 3 per cent pay rise.British workers put in among the longest hours in the EU, according to separate research by the TUC.The union organisation found that the average full-time week in Britain has shortened by 18 minutes over the past decade, and at the current rate of progress, it would take 63 years for workers to get the same amount of free time as elsewhere in Europe.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Shutdowns generally came in response to protests or civil unrest, especially in the build-up to elections.WhatsApp is about to stop working on these phonesBeyond the economic impact, the researchers said the shutdowns were especially worrying for human rights and democracy.However, not all shutdowns were an attempt to stifle free speech. In India last August,\u0026nbspinternet connections were blocked in an attempt to prevent rumour-mongering and the spread of misinformation that led to violent protests in some areas of the country.A spokesperson for WhatsApp said at the time: The challenge of mob violence requires government, civil society, and technology companies to work together. The police also use WhatsApp\u0026nbspto discuss investigations and report crimes.WhatsApp did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the latest research.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The nurses were around her.“She [Thornberry] had her left hand up in the air and they quite quickly put it in a sling for her.“We were there for over two hours in total. It felt aswe weren’t as important.“I was there with someone struggling quite badly to breathe, they in a lot of distress.“We were still sat there at that time she left - although we’d been there half an hour before she arrived.“We were in a queue system so we were very concerned and frustrated.”Patients attending AE departments register and are normally pre-assessed by a nurse or doctor - known as triage.This is meant to ensure that those with the most serious conditions are seen first.Thornberry is MP for Islington South and Finsbury - a short distance from the hospital.Previously seen as an ally of Jeremy Corbyn she has said she will stand to replace him as Labour leader.A spokesman for Thornberry said: “Like everyone  at AE that day she waited to be seen for her badly-cut and bleeding hand for more than an hour.“At no stage did any member of staff in the waiting room acknowledge her or treat her dferently.“Emily is sorry that another patient and their friend had a bad experience waiting for treatment, but that had nothing to do with her.”Figures reveal that between July and September last year  per cent of AE patients at UCLH were treated, discharged or admitted within the four- hour target.

The world is watching.IF HS goes to plan it will improve the lives of commuters, boost jobs in the North and Midlands and drag our creaking infrastructure into the st century.But a damning report revealing spending has spiralled out of control suggests that the scheme has become like a runaway train with a driver asleep at the wheel.Thanks to an obsession with speed, the project’s directors have overlooked connectivity — which should have been their priority.Given taxpayers are forking out billions — enough to build  new large hospitals — massive misjudgements like that are unforgivable.Those directors now have a choice.They can buck up their act and refocus on delivering real benefits for the North.Or they can keep splashing cash and wait until the Prime Minister puts the kibosh on the whole project.It’s time this plan got back on the rails.SLIPPERY Sadiq Khan can always be counted on to put ambition over principle.But the Labour London Mayor’s belated attack on Jeremy Corbyn brings new meaning to the word shameless.If he truly believed the public “got it right” when they rejected his party, he should have spoken out while the Marxist clowns were circling Number .Doing so now Corbyn has been safely confined to the dustbin of history proves Khan is nothing but a careerist coward.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Which will it be  The acidic lime-barrel, the chewy coconut caramel or the tooth-shattering walnut swirl Labour Party members face that sort of dilemma this week.The contest to be their next leader will begin properly today when MPsto Westminster. Defeat in last month’s ­General Election has left the party’s ranks depleted.The choice of candidates is hardly appetising.If you were talking about Quality Street, you’d say they’re all a bit nutty.Will it be wonkish Sir Keir Starmer, a legal oddball who never blinks, or will it be ­prolier-than-thou Jess Phillips, veering all over the political piste like Austrian ski legend Franz Klammer after lunch Could it be Lady Wobbles  I talk, naturally, of Emily Thornberry, who may or may not be the lovechild of Hattie Jacques and Boris Yeltsin.Her snobbery about White Van Man will probably knock la-di-dah Emily out of the running, although she is probably the one the Tories fear most.What about tough guy Clive Lewis, an unknown fashion dude from East Anglia whose only criticism of Jeremy Corbyn is that he wasn’t really left-wing enough Wigan lass Lisa Nandy — so earnest she looks asshe could burst into tears at any moment — is also in the contest. Then there is Rebecca Long-Bailey, she of the Mrs Merton spectacles, fanciedby Corbyn’s old Marxist sidekick John McDonnell.Long-Bailey is untested. But so are the others. I was going to shock you by noting that Thornberry, having once been a ministerial aide, is the only candidate to have had a snf of Whitehall experience.Then I realised that she is the only one of them to have actually sat on the governing side in the House of Commons.Nandy became an MP in , when Labour left office.The rest entered the Commons only in .OK, let’s look on the bright side. They should all have a certain novelty value.So how come they feel so unexciting  It’s because they represent old ideas.Tony Blair is nowadays a discredited figure but when he was leader of the Opposition in the s, he did something shrewd.He wrenched his party into the modern era by producing a pledge card with five basic promises. They helped him win a landslide in the  General Election.Blair’s five pledges reflected the electorate’s priorities: Smaller class sizes for primary schools, quicker punishment of young offenders, shorter NHS waiting times, getting younger people off benefits by using a windfall tax on privatised utilities, and a promise not to raise income tax.Blair grasped how Labour was seen by the voters. His pledge card helped address those worries. The policies themselves were only part of the trick. Equally important was the idea that Blair’s Labour was prepared to listen.A quarter of a century on, the next Labour leader should repeat Blair’s trick and be honest about how the party is seen.Here are five basic philosophical pledges that might help to address the problem.PLEDGE : Saving is a virtue. One reason Jeremy Corbyn bombed in last month’s election was that his spending plans were seen as madly extravagant. Voters may not like government “austerity” but they aren’t mugs. They know state spending has to be paid for.If you are a government or an inidual, you can’t live for ever on the never-never.It’s time Labour reacquainted itself with prudence.PLEDGE : Patriotism is honourable. Wouldn’t it be amazing to hear a Labour leader say this Yet since the decline of the British Empire, the Left has regarded patriotism as a dirty word. This is electorally crazy.Patriotism is merely an expression of civic pride, of communal values channelled into the identity of the democratic nation state and its Queen.Working-class former Labour voters love American patriotism .They applaud the Aussies and South Africans when they wave their flags.What is so wrong with being proud of Britain PLEDGE : Stable families strengthen us all.I’m not making a point about marital infidelities — MPs are the last people who should preach about sex! — but Labour’s promotion of metropolitan lestyles has created an idea it disapproves of “normal” family set-ups.Add to that its reluctance to give families tax breaks and its strange cultural suspicion of adoption. Former Labour seats are often areas with the strongest notion of traditional family solidarity.A wise leadership candidate would acknowledge that.PLEDGE : Brexit is irreversible. Please. This matter has been settled.And yet that fool Jess Phillips is hinting that she wants us to rejoin the EU. Electoral suicide.PLEDGE : No more jobsworths. Bigger than everything  is the suspicion that officialdom is an ass.The British people are wonderfully tolerant but they are driven mad by petty regulation — particularly when it comes to minority grievances.“Jobsworths” who say that ignoring daft political-correctness is “more than my job’s worth” are the bane of Britain.Who is more intolerant: A provincial baker who hesitates to ice a wedding cake for a gay couple, or the gay couple who take that baker to the High Court to prove a point We all know whose side Labour politicians would have been on.A would-be Labour leader who cheerfully made these pledges would be a Labour leader who could connect with the electoral mainstream.But will any of them do so  Don’t hold your breath.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He’s been rude to the world’s biggest stars before. Never has he hit the nail on the head like that or with such venom.For too long, politically correct movie actors and musicians have lectured the little people on how to live better lives, lives more like theirs. They tell us to cut back — as they fly around the globe in private jets and live in multiple mansions with monstrous carbon footprints.They leap aboard every soul-sappingly tedious and vacuously “woke” bandwagon and instruct us to do the same.They tell us how to vote — always noisily and cluelessly backing the left, safe in the knowledge no forced redistribution could ever really dent their vast wealth.At last a fellow multi-millionaire actor and comic has told them to shut up. That they’re “in no position to lecture the public about anything”. That they “know nothing about the real world”.Ordinary people ARE sick of these ill-informed egomaniacs. That’s why celebrity endorsements never help Labour here — or the Democrats in the US.We doubt that any of these Golden Globetrotters will have the self-awareness or humility to wind their necks in.But we’re proud that as millions watched, cheering, a plain-talking Brit burst the celebs’ bubble.Every word was bang on their money.WE have our fingers crossed for the Cyprus gang-rape teenager as she learns her fate today.She may yet be freed with a presidential pardon. If not, the already grave doubts about the country’s justice ­system will deepen.And our Foreign Secretary will have every justication in warning Brits about the safety of its resorts like Ayia Napa.It is increasingly obvious this young woman was shamefully treated, by the men involved, by police and by the judge.President Nicos Anastasiades must end this madness.BREXITERS have won another battle: The Government will launch parallel trade talks with the US and EU next month. Excellent.It’s not just that a little competition should generate some urgency in both.

His punishment fits his crimes. I dont want to discuss the case any further.In the UK, Sinaga spent a decade partying funded by a very rich family in Indonesia who didnt know he was gay and begged him to settle down and marry a woman.He blew his rich property tycoon dads money on partying as he enjoyed Manchesters liberal and tolerant atmosphere to homosexuality.But his openly gay lestyle was a world away from the strict Catholic upbringing he had in Indonesia where homosexuality is frowned upon and illegal in some states.His parents Saibun and Normawaty didnt even know their son was gay and tried to pester him into getting married.Sinaga targeted tipsy revellers as they poured out of nearby nightclubs then filmed himself raping his unconscious victims in the seedy lair on a makesht bed.He used the date rape drug GHB on his victmis after he go them to his flat.A Sun Online investigation revealed how cheap GHB is to buy online.A former friend told The Sun: His relationship with his family wasn’t good.They found him odd even before he came out as gay. And he didn’t come out to them.“I think he liked to get people’s attention to compensate. He used to say he was depressed because his parents tried to make him meet some girl from his country.“The relationship wasn’t good because they wanted him to marry and have a family. We used to tell him to cheer up because he could be himself in Manchester. Everyone felt sorry for him not being able to be himself with his family.He used to change his hair and clothes to go home and see them.”Sinaga grew up in a mansion in the centre of Jakarta with a house brimming with maids and drivers.But the Spice Girls-obsessed fiend struggled to be himself with his family, who found him odd and wanted him to meet a girl from Indonesia to wed.Instead, Sinaga moved to the UK as a student in  when he was  where he studied a masters in planning at Manchester University.The bright student then completed another masters in sociology before enrolling in a PhD in geography at Leeds University, commuting there from Manchester.His thesis was titled Sexuality and everyday transnationalism: South Asian gay and bisexual men in Manchester.He was suspended from the university on his arrest and will not be allowed to complete his doctorate.Sinaga had begun to explore his sexuality as a student and had a string of boyfriends during his time living in Manchester.A pal said: He would go to the gay village with us, but he used to tell us that during the week he would go to other clubs around. He liked masculine guys.But while living near Manchesters clubbing scene, Sinaga would watch as his targets  - usually straight men - poured in and out of nearby bars Factory and Fth Avenue.And the rapist would prowl the streets outside the Manchester clubs in the early hours looking for lone, drunk men to attack.He even played Top Trumps of people he raped by keeping screenshots of his victims social media profiles after checking their IDs.He also boasted of using his “secret poison” to make young, straight men “fall in love” with him.In one chilling encounter captured on CCTV, he left his flat and ed with a victim just  seconds later.He was finally arrested after a hero rugby player battered him after he woke up naked to find Sinaga molesting him.The teenager beat the predator so violently he left the rapist with a bleed on the brain and blood splattered around the flat.Sinaga then spun a web of lies after being stretchered to hospital - meaning the victim, then aged , was arrested on suspicion of assault.But the blundering rapist had accidentally left an iPhone  in the teens back pocket containing gruesome videos of him attacking his drugged victims.Police raced to twisted Sinagas lair where they discovered another mobile - this time propped to side” to capture rapes “in profile”.On Monday Sinaga was caged for le after being found guilty of  charges against  men - aged between  and  - between January  and June .But cops found footage and other evidence of up to  victims on laptops and the two iPhones.Most of his victims had no clue they had been attacked.

Just because you ignore it, it doesn’t mean it no longer exists.Now research shows that going for regular runs could add years to your le.Running reverses the effects of ageing on your blood vessels, and even after a few goes runners have lower blood pressure than when they started.I’m about to run my first marathon at the ripe old age of , having built up the habit from a standing start.Here are some other good things running does:Weight will drop off you — I’m three stone lighter after taking it up two years ago. Your sleep cycle improves. Weirdly, you will have more energy. Your mental health will be better. It will spur you on to be healthy in other aspects of le.I get it, though. It’s easy to look at the swathe of runners and balk. Not a single thing about it looks fun.While some jammy gits manage to glide around the streets looking effortless, most of us look sweaty, out of breath and in deep, deep discomfort. Because we are.Most runners hate doing the actual running. Occasionally, on a nice balmy evening, you might forget you are five miles from home and the only way to get there is to keep running. But more often than not, you’re willing it to be over.No, most runners don’t run for the joyful act of running — we run for the sublime, borderline orgasmic feeling of having run.I sobered up more than two years ago, which would never have been a success had I not taken up running.I was a fastidious non-runner. I’d tried it, it was boring and it really, really hurt. But as those with addictive personalities know only too well, you have to swap drink with something. After Robbie Williams gave up cocaine he ensured Colombia still earned a few quid by necking up to  espressos a day.Like all men staring middle age in the face, I’d ignored any form of cardio exercise and instead spent a decade seeking the cliched T-shirt look.Abs that could give you a paper cut, biceps like grapefruits and whole hams for shoulders.All that cardio looked too much like hard work. And besides, you didn’t see Brad Pitt legging it round the park in Fight Club, did you Well as it turns out, the abs didn’t materialise and I just ended up feeling miserable. So when sobriety kicked in and I had a lot more time on my hands, I decided to see what running was about.My first go was an absolute tragedy and I am grateful no one witnessed me running a mere  yards before tripping over my dog. It was awful. I was wheezing and clutching my spare tyre, but I had broken the seal.Five minutes later I felt great. The dopamine and endorphins kicked in and I could have taken on the world, although my hamstrings said otherwise.Those  yards became  the next day and so on until I hit my first milestone — one whole kilometre. I was now officially hooked.Within two months I had completed my first Parkrun. Anyone who feels self-conscious about running should join their local Parkrun, as the sense of community and inclusion is fantastic.I’d shed a stone and felt utterly incredible — and I didn’t stop there. I now run more than  miles every week and in April I will take on my first London Marathon. I’m excited but also utterly terried.If you’re a non-runner, the thought of running is daunting.But trust me, aside from giving up smoking, it will be the most rewarding thing you’ll do for your body and mind. As well as the physical benefits it really, really sorts your head out.No social media, no people chasing work — it’s just you and your thoughts. I’ve had some of my best ideas and made some le-changing decisions running along the side of the Basingstoke canal.Just try it for a week. It’s completely free, unless you’re like me and treat it as an excuse to open up a whole new world of gadgetry.You can do it anywhere at any time you feel like it. And, crucially, you will never regret going for a run, ever.Put on any old pair of trainers, stick the headphones in, listen to a podcast, pick a landmark to run to and just go for it, as slowly as you need to. If it hurts, stop running and walk, then run again for a bit — and so on.This was me two years ago — and now Mo Farah had better be looking over his shoulder in April .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Those conversations are at a very early stage.“There is a very careful and serious process to go through which they are going to respect.“But it is clear they are on a dferent and unique path, and they are very much thinking about what the future looks like for them.”The friend went on: “That could include being based in Canada or the possibility of walking away from their HRH titles, although hopefully it will not come to that.“It’s been a very tough year — they’re newlyweds and they have a young baby — so they’re looking at what their le looks like in the future. Everything is on the table.”Harry and Meghan visited Canada’s London headquarters today on theirto work.Canada has replaced an African state as the number one option for the couple to make their semi-permanent base outside of the UK.The friend explained: “They have a lot of friends there.“Meghan feels comfortable and at home there because she lived there for seven years before meeting Harry.“They very much enjoyed their time over Christmas and New Year where they weren’t pictured once and were left alone.”Harry and Meghan’s official staff will remain at Buckingham Palace.But the couple are expected to work closely with the controversial US PR company Sunshine Sachs to launch the Sussex Royal Foundation in the coming months.The friend added: “They took a genuine break over Christmas. But they are back working and planning the launch of the Sussex Royal Foundation and Sunshine Sachs are involved in that.”The decisions Harry and Meghan make are likely to be highly controversial and unconventional, with some courtiers worrying it could essentially see the couple “exile themselves from the royal family”.However, their friends argue it has become clear to the couple that the monarchy is moving towards a future focused on Prince Charles and Prince William.One said: “They are back to work. They have nothing to hide and have got so much good work to do.But it has been made very clear by the institution that the Sussexes are not central to the future plan.“Just look at the picture released last week of the Queen with the Prince of Wales, Duke of Cambridge and George.”Meghan’s pals also laughed off claims she is not happy with the British weather, as has recently been claimed.Another friend said: “That is ridiculous. Look at the temperatures in Canada.”Harry and Meghan spent their first Christmas with baby Archie at a rented .million home in Vancouver Island.They were also visited by Meghan’s mum Doria Ragland, snubbing a royal Christmas at Sandringham just days after Prince Philip was taken to hospital.The , sq ft property on Canada’s West Coast boasts five bedrooms and eight bathrooms, as well as a guest cottage with three beds and two baths.Temporary fencing, cameras and security were added to the home during their stay.In March, they attended a Commonwealth Day event at Canada House celebrating Canadian culture with expats from the country in the UK.Pregnant Meghan was presented with a babygro emblazoned with a maple leaf.Harry held his Invictus Games for wounded soldiers in the Canadian city of Toronto in .

Harry spoke of his desire to leave the UK in a controversial ITV documentary with Tom Bradby last October, suggesting Cape Town as a potential location.Meghan also admitted to becoming disillusioned with public le in the programme.She said: “It’s not enough to just survive something, right  That’s not the point of le. You’ve got to thrive, you’ve got to feel happy.“I really tried to adopt this British sensibility of a stf upper lip. I tried, I really tried.

More than a third of those polled said that telling an obvious fib on a CV will see it binned, while just over one in  donapost like it when social media handles are included. Shelley Preston, head of Adecco Retail which commissioned the research, said: Your CV is your door opener and it has to be accurate. Recruiters will see dozens -not hundreds - of applications and while itaposs important your CV stands out, you want it to be for the right reasons. The first step is making sure everything is spelt perfectly, because errors like that show youaposre likely to have similar low standards in your career. The study also found just under a tenth of those who hire staff hate layouts which are too complicated to actually read, while one in five would be turned off by a rude or inappropriate email address. And a fth have even been amazed after an applicant got their companyaposs name wrong when applying for the job. However, just under six in  have made an initial negative judgement on a CV, only for the candidate to turn out to be better than expected.  On the other hand, three quarters have had an applicant turn in a brilliant resume, only to be hopeless once theyaposd landed the job, according to the OnePoll research. Half of those polled admitted that a candidate who had a perfectly written CV but didnapost seem like a perfect fit for a job would most likely be invited for an interview anyway. But four in  say a single typo on an otherwise perfect application would hold them back from offering that person an interview. And on average, for every  CVs the average employer looks at, four of them will contain a typo or spelling mistake. The problem could be generational though, as  per cent agree that young people today are more likely to have a aposterribleapos CV, compared to a decade ago. Around half even admitted to having a CV come their way with an error on it so hilarious, they were moved to print it out and show it to their colleagues.

Tory ministers issued an unreserved apology for the blunder and launched an independent review last night after the Cabinet Office initially said the list of addresses was online for about an hour. Sir Elton John, senior police officers and former Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders were all among those who had their details accidentally uploaded to the government website.At the time of the leak between Christmas and New Year, the Cabinet Office told the BBC the data was online for around an hour. Another outlet reported the Cabinet Office had said it was online for  minutes.Last night, however, Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden has claried that while a link to the data was removed after  minutes, anyone who had the direct web link could continue to see the data for a further  minutes. That meant the data was only fully removed  minutes after it went online at .pm on Friday  December - despite being spotted by the government at pm. The blunder has been reported to the Information Commissioner which has the power to issue multi-million pound fines. And the Cabinet Office last night launched an independent review of data handling practices in the department - which co-ordinates work between the whole of Whitehall and  Downing Street. This review will focus on process, culture, policy and practice within the Department, Mr Dowden said. It will establish whether appropriate controls are in place around the storage, sharing and deletion of personal data, including learning lessons from this case. More information on this review will be published shortly. Changes have already been made to ensure the relevant IT system generates reports containing only data that is suitable for publication, removing the scope for further human error.  Mr Dowden said appropriate management action will be taken but did not claryanyone would be sacked. He added: On behalf of the Cabinet Office I apologise unreservedly for any distress or inconvenience caused. Mr Dowden admitted the incident led to a briefing of police Chief Constables, necessary actions to protect high risk cases, and assessments from local police forces to check the safety of all recipients.  However, police and other agencies have now reported that there is no information to suggest any of those named on the list faced any new risk to their safety. He added: The Department has worked with the relevant organisations to ascertain the extent of the access to the data. We have no evidence that data has been exploited by a third party, or shared more widely though we continue to be vigilant.

And it appears one of the first to be attracted to Cummings’ misfit bat signal was Uri Gellar. The spoon-bender, who claims to have psychic powers bestowed upon him by aliens, says he has formally applied for a role in the Johnson administration, arguing his “genuine” powers would be an asset to the Government. According to the , Mr Geller’s covering letter claims his entertainment career was a “perfect mask” for espionage work for the CIA and FBI. A  BBC documentary claimed Mr Geller had worked as a “psychic spy” for the CIA, was recruited by Mossad and was an “official secret agent” in Mexico. In his letter, it’s reported he mentioned an incident also featured in the documentary, where Mr Geller claimed to have erased floppy disks being carried to Moscow by KGB agents by repeatedly chanting the word “erase.” A source close to Mr Gellar told the : Uri is  per cent serious about taking up a role in Government. “He concedes that his application might be one of the more unusual received by Dominic Cummings, but hopes that he can see the potential value of having Uri on board. “He is particularly keen on using his powers to tackle growing tensions in the Middle East. It’s not the first time Mr Geller has attempted to get involved with British politics.He claimed to have assisted in Theresa May becoming Prime Minister using the power of his mind.In March he told Good Morning Britain: I’ve known Theresa May for over  years. I lived in the same village. She visited my home. I took her to my garage. I pointed to this spoon that belonged to Winston Churchill. This was three years before she became Prime Minister. I bombard her mind. I said you are going to be the Prime Minister. She laughed and said she didn’t believe. She is [PM]. He later declared his plan to stop Mrs May pursuing Brexit using psychic energy.In an open letter to the Prime Minister, the Israeli-British TV personality said he felt psychically and very strongly that most Britons were anti-Brexit and vowed to stop the process telepathically. He wrote: I feel psychically and very strongly that most British people do not want Brexit . I love you very much but I will not allow you to lead Britain into Brexit. As much as I admire you, I will stop you telepathically from doing this - and believe me I am capable of executing it. Before I take this drastic course of action, I appeal to you to stop the process immediately while you still have a chance.

Her conviction is a possible miscarriage of justice, she deserves to have her name cleared. Protests by Cypriot women demonstrate the growing belief in the country that courts and authorities in the country are hostile to vulnerable women when they go to the police complaining they have been sexually assaulted. Visitors to popular holiday resorts, as well as nationals, deserve to know that investigations into alleged sex offences will be thoroughly and sensitively investigated and that any suspect will have access to a lawyer and their interviews recorded. Our own Government should not be smug when prosecutions here have fallen despite rape allegations to the police in England and Wales doubling in six years. Look at the law Locking a grandmother suffering from multiple sclerosis in a police cell for eight hours because she makes cannabis-laced chocolate bars was unnecessary. Lesley Gibson turned to cannabis when her NHS prescription was cancelled, surely our drug laws now need relaxing. This is not an argument to scrap all drug laws or advocating their widespread use but a plea to approve limited medicinal use for those with serious conditions.  The jury is out over the benefits of cannabis use and some of the risks are undeniable. It is a waste of police time for officers to detain grandmothers with MS.

Oliver Simpson, , has inherited disorder Phenylketonuria, which means he can have only g of protein per day. It means as well as his favourite side dish, other protein-rich food including meat, fish and nuts are off the menu, as are milk, eggs and yoghurt. And he canapost even eat sweets. On Christmas Day he couldn’t eat turkey, pigs in blankets or stuffing while the rest of his family tucked into their traditional festive roast. The rare condition also known as PKU - which affects just , people worldwide - means he is unable to break down phenylalanine - an amino acid found in protein rich food. As a result it builds up in the blood, a development that can lead to seizures, tumours, brain damage, delayed mental development and ultimately death. Mum Jade, , said: “I have to be really strict with Oliver and his diet.  “He doesn’t understand, as he’s so young, but eating the wrong food could lead to brain damage, or worse.” Jade is also mum to Angel Rose, six, who doesn’t have the condition. Oliver was diagnosed with PKU following a heel prick test when he was five days old. “You’re always curious about what everyone  is eating and want to try it,” she said. “But the reality is that it could make you really ill.”  Jade, of Kentish Town, north London, won’t let Oliver go to other children’s houses for playdates. She is worried that he could accidentally eat something that could cause his protein blood levels to dangerously spike.

The -year-old caught up in the Cyprus gang rape case has finally flown home after a frightening ordeal included four weeks in prison. A judge gave her a four-month jail sentence, suspended for three years, but she has vowed to appeal. She and her family boarded an evening British Airways flight from Larnaca to London Heathrow. The flight was fully booked – but two passengers agreed to take a later plane to allow the family to get back sooner. Police claimed she made up a sex attack by  Israelis in an Ayia Napa budget hotel and she was found guilty of a public nuisance offence.The woman, from Derbyshire, was filmed as she had consensual sex with one of the group after a holiday romance. She claimed one of the youths knelt on her shoulders to pin her down during the alleged attack on July  last year. Judge Michalis Papathanasiou refused to accept that she had been raped after she withdrew her statement. Fighting back tears, the teenager, who cannot be named, paid tribute to her “wonderful” parents. Outside the court in Paralimni, she said: “I have done nothing wrong and am devoted to carrying on fighting.” They will now battle to clear her name so she can fulfil her ambition to become a counter-terror police officer. During her month in a Nicosia jail she had to share a cell with eight other inmates in a prison which houses killers, other violent offenders and thieves. Her ordeal left her suffering from PTSD.  Around  activists could be heard shouting “Mr Judge, shame on you, don’t you have a daughter ” as he told the teenager that she had been found guilty of a “very serious crime”. Judge Papathanasiou said: “The accused deserves and should be given a second chance. “I take into consideration, her emotional state of mind when she gave the  deposition.” Her mum thanked the public “in the UK and across the world for the tremendous support” they have given the family. The girl’s defence team added: “This young woman has shown immense bravery, courage and fortitude in coming forward. “We cannot allow this ‘blame the victim culture’ to continue.” Semi-pro footballer Shimon Yusufov, , has been named as the Israeli man who had consensual sex with the woman.

Delilah Mortimer discovered the two-inch long metal blade among the puzzle pieces when she opened the LOL Surprise puzzle on Christmas Day. Mum Amy, from Portsmouth, Hants, was horried and has complained to the manufacturer about the popular toy packaged inside a plastic ball. Thankfully, Delilah alerted her shocked mother, who complained to the manufacturer, which has now launched an investigation. The emailed Amy saying: We would like to assure you that this is being investigated and will be passed to the appropriate manufacturer for further investigation. Amy said: Iaposd bought a load of presents for my kids in the sale at Sainsburyaposs and had been excited for them to get to play with their new toys. Delilah opened the case of her LOL Surprise puzzle toy a few hours after weaposd finished unwrapping presents and picked out the blade amongst the puzzle pieces inside. Luckily, she did not cut herself but the sharp blade bit was poking out dangerously. I have another child, my little boy Arlo who is four years old, and I can imagineArlo was the one who opened the toy then he would have easily cut himself.  The mum-of-two bought the toy from Sainsburys in Portsmouth on October  during a sale, and put them away from Christmas. The hairdresser and husband Anthony, , watched as their daughter opened the plastic ball containing a  piece surprise puzzle. Amy said: Me and her father and her brother Arlo were luckily sat next to her as she opened her present as she was really excited to see what was inside. She then picked up the blade amongst the puzzle pieces and asked usthataposs meant to be in there and said aposthis is sharpapos and she handed it to us.  Then we realised itaposs wrapped in some kind of tape with a very sharp blade hanging out and realised that it was not part of the toy. Thank God she didnapost cut herself. I just hope no one  has found a blade in their Xmas toy as well. I assume it was either planted by a worker or maybe they use that tool in the warehouse and accidentally dropped it in. Iaposm hoping somebody just dropped it by accident, and not someone planting sharp blades in childrenaposs Christmas toys.  Concerned Amy complained to Sainsburyaposs and LOL. A Sainsburyaposs spokesperson said: We are in contact with Amy and supporting Spin Masteraposs investigation. A spokesperson for Spin Master - which manufactures the toy for multiple retailers - said: We are very sorry to hear about this unfortunate incident.

Both families enjoy immense wealth, but are forced to live in private compounds to avoid scrutiny.Their families and friends become their bodyguards, keeping their secrets and taking to the mattresses with them in times of trouble.The head of the family demands you swear an oath of loyalty, and everyone is kept in line by the consigliere or top courtier. Every son establishes their own court of supporters, who engage in power struggles with their siblings and parents.And legal issues can be an unwelcome intrusion, even on the day of a daughteraposs wedding. And there are rules that must be followed. You can do pretty much anything, run a casino badly, go bankrupt, get your toes sucked, have affairs. The worst crime is to go against the family, and the greatest punishment is exile. Perhaps Harry promised Meghan that within  years theyaposd have reformed the Royals to the extent they could be legitimate philanthropists. But in this family there are rigid lines of inheritance, and the next leader is always chosen in strict uterine order . As sixth in line to the throne, Harry is on course to become ever less-powerful in the family business. They wonapost be able to reform anything. But he, Meghan and Archie will, nevertheless, still have to follow all the rules.  When Harry married Meghan she, like Keatonaposs character Kay Adams, probably thought things would be dferent. That together they could reform an old-fashioned institution, and do something good with all that wealth and power.And theyaposve done their best. The Invictus games, the Grenfell tower cookbook, Harryaposs landmine campaign, Meghanaposs Smart Works clothing line helping poorer women into work, and her inspiration to others as a woman of colour.Heck, I was delighted just by her decision to walk down the aisle alone. Marriages are not about property being exchanged between men, but adults making a choice to walk alongside each other. If more people realised that, thereaposd be much less heartache in the world. No doubt Meghan and Harry wanted to continue his motheraposs work as a high-profile charitable campaigner. But they forgot one thing - she only ever came into her own when she left.  Once youaposre in The Firm, your friends have a path to wealth and fame by association, as well as hate and abuse. You have immense pressure, media attention, and political responsibilities.It becomes a matter of crucial national importance as to whether you are wearing a hat, and what this means for the monarchy. People discuss, at , what jewellery one of the outlaws wears to an event you both attend. Every word you speak, glance you throw, or pair of socks you put on has more ramications than an opening gambit in D chess.Youaposre not a person, when youaposre Royal. Youaposre a role. And Harry doesnapost have much of one any more.  So the best this well-intentioned, angst-ridden, slightly-uptight couple can do is to become like George and Amal Clooney - immensely wealthy and intensely secluded, with occasional forays into the public eye to do good or promote a cause, while raising their family in private. Theyaposd still be in a gilded cage, but itaposs one where - George and Amal may assure them - fewer rocks will be thrown at them.And perhaps Harry imagines that this way, they can remain friends with the family. There is no betrayal, no squealing to the feds, no abdication and subsequent exile. You can still go home for birthdays.But it takes only one ill-advised deal with a casino boss, plastic surgeon or drug gang kingpin and trouble would kick off again. Because, like the Corleones, you can never really leave this family.For all of us, it is ma fia - the nationaposs family. We watch their squabbles and compare them with our own. For centuries their character has had an impact on our history, and as long as Royals exist that obsession will not be easily dropped.Harry and Meghan could renounce everthing, and retire to a hut in Snowdonia, and thereaposd still be people with cameraphones. As millionaire philanthropists, they still wonapost be the Clooneys - every utterance will be interpreted through the lens of protocol and family politics. Meghan could neverto acting, because sheaposll never be able to convince an audience sheaposs anything but a princess.No matter how peripheral they become, there is still a potential for international diplomatic incidents. Just ask Uncle Andrew for details.Of course, itaposs unlikely the Queen would allow a polo pony to be slaughtered just to make a point, but itaposs still possible for a former Royal to wind up sleeping with the fishes.If Princess Diana had retained Royal levels of security after her orce, she would never have died in that underpass. The promise of protection, and the threat of removing it, is exactly how the mafia has always operated. For Harry and Meghan itaposs not a choice of which country to live in, or what rich friends to hang out with. They have to pick their poison.The th in line to the throne can become low-profile, stay wealthy, and become ever-less scrutinised the further they move down the line of succession with every subsequent birth. But that takes time, and patience. Radical change has never worked for the monarchy or the mob. Both focus on long-term survival. Harry and Meghanaposs instinct may well be to get out, in the interests of quick and immediate happiness. But as Michael Corleone discovered,you want to change the family you need to stay in it. Andyou stay in it, the family changes you. Itaposs best not to join in the first place.

When her weight peaked at  stone, Hannah was determined to make a change. One day I looked in the mirror, and I wondered for the first time how anybody could ever love me, she conceded. EspeciallyI couldn’t even love myself.  I had to do something – not only for me, but for my daughter Isabelle. I’d hate itshe got bullied at school, just because her mum was so big. I now walk everywhere, not one taxi in sight. I go on hikes, and run, and do Clubbercise classes, and I get at least , steps in a day. Hannah credits Slimming World for cracking down on her diet, leading to her winning its aposgreatest loserapos competition in .  When she first joined, she says she was too strict on her food, restricting herself to water and salad in restaurants, but she quickly became unhappy watching other eat around her.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussexaposs took time out over the festive period after a tough year in the public eye. Now, the ITV News At Ten anchor Tom Bradby said it was no secret that they could leave the UK to start a le abroad. His comments follow speculation the couple are considering basing themselves in the Commonwealth country for part of this year. The Sun reported the couple are due to meet senior royals in the coming days to discuss the plans which could include the long-term proposal to move their office to the country or even relinquish their His and Her Royal Highness titles. Mr Bradby interviewed the couple for a documentary last year where they highlighted the pressures they have faced and Harry talked about his rt with his brother, the Duke of Cambridge. Appearing on ITVaposs Good Morning Britain show, the news anchor said about Meghan and Harry: I think the truth is thereaposs a lot, I think, going on, thereaposs a lot going on within the royal family and I donapost know - and Iaposm not sure they know - what their future is going to be and what their position is... Asked about the claims by the Sun the couple are considering spending more time in Canada, Mr Bradby replied: I donapost know the answer to that. Itaposs no big secret in their friends that they have been considering their options in the future. He added: I donapost ask what their plans are and they keep that pretty close to their chest and understandably so. I donapost think itaposs a done deal, that would be my impression. I think thereaposs a lot of talking to be done, there are a million possibilities, they could go to Canada. Any move to Canada, even for a period of the year, would throw up important questions about Meghan and Harryaposs future within the royal family.  All members of the monarchy carry out their public duties in support of the Queen and they would likely have to take part in official events in Canada. The cost of security for the couple would also be an issue, and as Canada is a realm, a country where the Queen is head of state, it may have to pay for keeping the couple and their son Archie safe.

According to The Sun the couple are considering setting up camp on the other side of the Atlantic full or part time. “It is true that Harry and Meghan will spend a fair amount of time in Canada over the next couple of months and possibly going forward too, an unnamed friend told the paper. “Right now they are starting talks with their family about their plans for the future. Those conversations are at a very early stage. “There is a very careful and serious process to go through which they are going to respect. An advisor to the couple later said it was not something that had been discussed at Buckingham Palace. The Buckingham Palace source said that they would not comment on the story as it was aposspeculativeapos.  If the rumours do turn out to be true then it would not be the first time Harry has looked for an exit from the firm. Back in  he told the Mail on Sunday: There was a time I felt I wanted out. But then I decided to stay in [the Royal Family] and work out a role for myself.” In going to Canada for the winter break Harry and Meghan skipped the traditional  Royal Family  Christmas celebrations in Sandringham. They took their little boy Archie for a relaxing break, staying in a huge mansion on Vancouver Island and enjoying hikes with friends in the countryaposs beautul national parks.

Stephanie Muller, , wants to raise awareness of a medical condition that left her unable to consummate her marriage for two years. Stephanie and -year-old new husband Andrew decided they would wait to have sex until they wed after meeting at their local church in New York in . The couple became an item in  and courted for two years before tying the knot in May . However, on their honeymoon, attempts to have sex where thwarted when they found penetration too dficult. Stephanie ended up with a severe yeast infection which medication failed to clear up over a three-month period. During that time she found having a pelvic exam so painful that she ended up in tears and shaken. Once the infection cleared up they tried again to no avail and she said the couple ended up feeling like roommates. They eventually discovered what was at the root of the problem in January  when Stephanie was diagnosed with vaginismus by her gynaecologist. The condition results in Stephanieaposs vagina tightening up when the couple attempt to have intercourse. Stephanie said: Saving sex for my wedding night was my personal choice. I wanted to save sex for my wedding night because I didn’t want to have sex with anyone that wasn’t my husband.  I personally believe that sex is a very intimate and special thing, and I didn’t want to share that with someone  that I would not end up marrying. Stephanie said she felt ashamed that she wasn’t able to have sex with her husband and it made her feel like they were friends. My husband and I have talked about how vaginismus really de-sexualised our relationship it was almost like living with a roommate, she said. We would even be careful about other physical things because neither of us wanted to suggest trying to have sex, be disappointed, and the night ending in tears.Stephanie was referred to the Vaginismus and Women’s Therapy Centre but this would not be covered by her health insurance. So instead she was prescribed her with Vicodin, a medicine used to relieve moderate to severe pain, to have sex with her husband. In September  Stephanie looked at other things she could do and the couple decided not to let her condition affect their intimacy.  In January last year the couple undertook a five-month treatment course at Womenaposs Therapy Centre in Plainview, New York, that the break through happened and Stephanie is now healed. She said: Having vaginismus is a heavyweight, and what largely makes it so dficult is the isolation and shame that comes with it. My husband has been incredibly supportive throughout my journey with vaginismus."},{"url":null,"title":"man bit ex girlfriends nose","story":"NewsMan bit off ex-girlfriends nose during row and either flushed it down loo or ate itAllyson Danylko, , was allegedly attacked by her ex-boyfriend after they ed home from a New Years Eve party in Toronto, Canada.

Ideally, we’ve got to be finishing second,” he said.“It takes out that extra two games in the play-offs and that’s where we want to be, that’s what we’re looking towards and realistically we’ve got the squad to do that.“We’ve got to look to win every game and it’s down to us really.

However, Dark Blues keeper Jack Hamilton gathered the header comfortably.Hamilton then made a smart stop from a whipped Keatings free-kick minutes later as the visitors continued to push for the opener.On  minutes Charlie Trafford forced a routine save out of Hamilton before, just a minute later, Inverness got the goal their play deserved.In acres of space down the right, full-back Shaun Rooney had the freedom of Dens Park to pick out Doran in the centre of the box and the Irish attacker duly lashed home from  yards.On  minutes, ICT were two to the good. From their own corner, Dundee compounded to lose possession and allowed the Highlanders to break.Former Dundee United man Keatings led the charge and finished the counter attack off himself, coolly slotting beyond a helpless Hamilton in the home goal.The Dark Blues huffed and puffed for the remainder of a dismal first half for them but were unable to lay a glove on Inverness as the boos rang out among the sizeable home support on the half-time whistle.Four minutes into the second period, Dundee forced Mark Ridgers into his first save of the afternoon as the ICT goalie stooped to turn Jordan Marshall#s long-range effort behind for a corner.Jordan McGhee was next to test Ridgers, firing in a dipping effort just before the hour mark, but the Caley stopper was able to gather.Moments later, Paul McGowan#s header from a deep Sean Mackie cross forced Ridgers to tip over as the Dee sought a way back into the contest.On  minutes, Kane Hemmings laid in Marshall but the left-back saw his effort from  yards deflected behind.Inverness# front four continued to look threatening but, largely, the Dee defence kept them quiet in the second .However, McPake#s men were unable to carve a way through an organised ICT defence with the rookie boss cutting a frustrated and under-pressure figure throughout.With Ayr and Dunfermline to face next, Dundee will certainly need to perform a lot betterthey are to stay in the mix for the promotion play-offs come the end of the season.Dundee XI : HamiltonKerr, Meekings , McGhee, Marshall Robertson, Dorrans, McGowan, MackieJohnson , Hemmings.Subs not used: Ferrie , Forster, Byrne, Moore and Cameron.Inverness XI : RidgersRooney, Donaldson, McHattie, TremarcoTrafford , Vincent StoreyKeatings Doran Todorov .Subs not used: Mackay , McCart, Curry and MacGregor.Referee: Don Robertson.Att: ,."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e0f531a474512.80393139-940x540.jpg ","title":"mcpake laments poor dee display","story":"Dundee manager James McPake believes their - defeat to Inverness at Dens on Saturday was as poor as they’ve been all season.The Dark Blues went down with a whimper to the Caley Jags as first-half goals from Aaron Doran and James Keatings had the game over as a contest after  minutes.And boss James ranks the loss up there with the - derby defeat to rivals Dundee United and the - capitulation against Partick at Dens.Askedhis side struggle to find he right levels at home, the Dee gaffer said: “No, I don’t think so.“You can pick games at home and away from home where we’ve been really good so it’s about being the way we are when we’re good and getting after teams.Dundee - Inverness CTGoals from Aaron Doran and @jameskeatings give nd placed Inverness CT victory at Dens Park against Dundee.@ICTFC @DundeeFC @spfl pic oCfXziEkmdash Sky Sports ScotlandJanuary , “On Saturday, for that first  minutes, it was as poor as we’ve been all season so I can’t even look at the other games where we have been poor.“We started the game really badly on Saturday and I don’t think it’s got anything to do with where we’re playing.“We just never came out the blocks the way we should’ve on the back of a half-decent run.”And that lack of momentum carried over from the - derby draw at Tannadice the weekend previous, given they were also on a four-match unbeaten run, surprised James.He added: “There should have been .“We were on the back of a half-decent run of form and I mean that with the consistency of our performances.“It looked like we knew what we were going to get over the past month or so in terms of the performance.“The energy and the drive in the team wasn’t there on Saturday.“Inverness were the opposite.

include internal works first which people won’t be able to see.”As well as the removal of the old main arena building, the covered walkway that connects to the section of the conference centre next to the Holiday Inn Express will also be removed.It is expected that the value of the work to be undertaken will be around £,.The warrant has an expiry date of January   and all work must be completed by then.It is understood that the remaining conference centre will be retained as well as the nearby park-and-ride facility.Talks regarding the future use of the site are still ongoing.Plans were previously submitted to the local authority by developers Henry Boot in May  for the land, which hoped to create a mixed use development including approximately  residential units, properties for commercial and business use, a recycling centre and park-and-ride facility.The application is still pending and there was a number of documents uploaded on to the site in , along with a letter of

all the credit for rise","story":"Exactly a year ago today Sam Cosgrove signed a contract extension tying him to Pittodrie until summer .Viewed  months on, tying up the striker’s long-term future was a masterstroke from the Aberdeen board.It would now take a multi-million-pound bid to force the Dons’ hand to sell a player who cost just £, in January .That could be tested this month as Middlesbrough, Derby County and Stoke are all tracking the -year-old.Prolic scoring does not go unnoticed and Aberdeen are braced for any approach or bid from England for Cosgrove this month.McInnes hailed the role head of recruitment Russ Richardson played in highlighting the then-unknown Carlisle United reserve player.He also acknowledged the Dons and the club’s coaching staff for giving Cosgrove the  to thrive.But ultimately it is the player, who netted  goals in , who is responsible for becoming one of the hottest strikers in Scotland.McInnes said: “Sam came to a club that could make him stronger, better and more confident.“All my staff have played a part in that.“My head of recruitment, Russ Richardson, also deserves so much praise for identying Sam.“When Russ watched Sam he liked how he received the ball and liked how he moved.“But ultimately Sam’s rise is not down to Russ, the staff or myself.“It is Sam who deserves the most for actually making the most of his opportunity. He relished the opportunity at Aberdeen and played the biggest part himself.”Officially Cosgrove netted  goals in  but the striker also netted a further two just days after penning his new deal.He scored both goals in Aberdeen’s - friendly win over United Arab Emirates’ side Dibba Al-Hisn in a friendly in Dubai last January.Cosgrove suffered a shaky start to his time at Aberdeen when sent off in his debut against Celtic on February  .He would have to wait  months since signing for his first goal when netting a double in a - defeat of St Mirren in October.That December he hit the goal trail, netting in five straight games to bag seven goals.McInnes insists they were looking for an alternative to prolic striker Adam Rooney. That December proved they had found one.Aberdeen then moved quickly to tie him up on a long-term deal beyond the contract that ran until summer .McInnes said: “We were looking for an alternative striker to Adam Rooney who we could work with and try to make better.“Jayden Stockley had obviously been with us but we knew we could maybe sell him back into England.“Jayden was maybe getting a bit frustrated that he wasn’t always playing ahead of Adam.“We wanted somebody a bit dferent with a bit of size.“When we first signed him that was something we spoke about but also to not be too dependent on his size in and around the box, to be a sharper striker and concentrate more on movement, positioning and anticipation rather than just letting the ball hit your head.“So thatteams sit in at home and want to defend their box, we have a striker there we can put in the box.“Sam has learned to use his size a lot better since being here.“He has relished the opportunity.”Cosgrove’s prolic scoring streak quickly caught the imagination of the Aberdeen supporters.They began chanting “Sam Cosgrove Ballon d’Or” at games in recognition of the successor to Rooney, who hit -plus goals for three successive season.Cosgrove has already smashed in  goals this season and became the first Aberdeen player to reach that milestone since Duncan Shearer in .He was denied the opportunity to add to that tally by a two-game ban for the final two games before the winter shutdown for a challenge on Celtic defender Kristoffer Ajer.Aberdeen appealed the straight red, arguing Cosgrove clearly won the ball, but the red and the ban were upheld.McInnes said: “There is no doubt that once Sam became really accepted by the supporters that meant so much to him.“For any young player,they know the supporters, the staff the players and the manager are behind him it means so much.“But particularly to know the supporters are right behind you because you can respond to that.“Sam has certainly responded.”"},{"url":null,"title":"meet rg mowat owner of the fulmar","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAt the end of November we asked readers for help to unravel the mystery of a yacht log book which was posted to the paper with no clues as to its origin.And, not for the first time, Argyllshire Advertiser readers have come up trumps and we now know a little more about the boat#s owner, named only as RG Mowat in the log book.The  log book gives an account of the voyages of the -foot gaff cutter #Fulmar# and the adventures of her colourful crew. Its dog-eared pages contain neatly-typed records, precise drawings and fascinating photographs.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun#, #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

Caroline and Duncan were parents to Calum, who sadly passed away aged  after being diagnosed with a brain tumour.Knowing he and his family lived in a beautul part of the world, Calum wanted children suffering from cancer to come to Bute for special getaways where the entire family could cherish quality time together and recharge their batteries for what may lie ahead.The charity now runs several holiday homes on Bute and private flats in Glasgow for families travelling to the city for treatments at the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Care and Royal Hospital for Children.Dumfries House Lodge is a -room, five-star country guest house with two self-catering cottages, all staffed round the clock.Eight families have been referred through the children#s charity so far to enjoy a four-night stay free of charge.Caroline said: #To allow Calum#s Cabin families to be helped in such a special way is an absolute honour.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation.

drive-thru fast-food outlet and new supermarket in Hawick are being recommended for approval.But the development will still need the go-ahead from Government ministers due to flood fears for the Commercial Road site.The application by Image Estates for the retail and takeaway development last spring was widely welcomed in Hawick.The developers have been in talks with both McDonalds and BM Bargains to occupy the site.But ongoing concerns from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencywill mean that eventhe full application is accepted by members of Scottish Borders Council on Monday, final approval will rest at Holyrood.Despite assurances from bosses of the ongoing Hawick Flood Protection Scheme, SEPA has maintained its stance.Planning officer Stuart Herkes explained: \"SEPA identies the sitersquos presence within the al flood plain, as the basis for its objection.\"Its concerns would be fully justied in any circumstance in which the proposed development were to go ahead without the Hawick Flood Protection Scheme first being in place.\"However, and despite the clear advice of the Hawick Flood Protection Scheme project team that it is able to directly accommodate the proposal within its calculations for the construction of the scheme, SEPA does not consider that it has been given sufficient reassurance that the site can be developed without unacceptable flood risk impacts.\"Owing to SEPArsquos outstanding objection in principle to this proposal on the grounds that the development would be at risk of, and would cause, unacceptable flooding impacts on the site and in the surrounding area, any approval of this application by members would itself require referral to, and approval by, Scottish Ministers.\"Image Estates hope to build the retail store as well as the restaurant with drive-thru facilities on the site of the former Bruce Motors showroom and neighbouring redundant mill buildings.During two public consultation events objections to the proposals were raised concerning flooding, the detriment of the environment and neighbouring amenities, as well as increased traffic the loss of historic buildings.But there has also been a lot of support for the plans.Mr Herkes added: \"The area has been transformed into a commercial hub and is considered to be a welcome offshoot and support to the high street.\"Further, new developments are welcomedthey support new employment opportunities.\"The site appears able to accommodate the level of floor space shown and would likely encourage further footfall to this area, especially a new drive through hot

Bet acquired these rights from IMG to use from the start of the - season.ldquoThis deal was agreed before we made a clear decision on the FArsquos relationship with gambling companies in June  when we ended our partnership with Ladbrokes.ldquoWe will review this element of the media rights sales process ahead of tendering rights to the new cycle from the - season onwards.

Football has played an historic role in unying our society, yet problem gambling and gambling disorder can tear families and communities apart, and has led to the loss of far too many lives already.ldquoThe reality is that lives are at risk now and waiting until  is not good enough ndash urgent action is needed to prevent further harm and the FA must work to scrap this harmful deal without delay.The Bishop of St Albans, Dr Alan Smith, described the situation as ldquoextraordinary.He said: ldquoThis plan puts gambling at the very core of broadcast football and may be unilaterally breaking gambling firmsrsquo ad ban ndash made only last year.ldquoItrsquos extraordinary that football bosses are allowing bookies to carry out this wholesale lsquogamblicationrsquo of our national sport.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration. Whatever your faith or spirituality, whatever your family or cultural traditions, I wish you a Happy New Year and I look forward to theof the sun, and sharing with you new adventures of discovery in our beautul county."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-youngsters-thank-lifeboat-crew-saving-lives","story":"Rachel Pirie and Luke Foster, both , were exploring the townrsquos clfs with Chloe McCaw, , at about noon on November  last year when the incident happened.The rising water levels left the youngsters, who all live in Dunbar and attend Dunbar Grammar School, cut off with no food, no water and one working mobile phone that did not have any credit.Police and Coastguard crews struggled to locate them.Talking about their ordeal, Rachel said: ldquoWe know the area well and the tide was well out so we thought we were safe.

I was alone and deep in thought. I cannot remember now exactly what the issue was, but something had happened that seemed to be unfair, and it had made me angry.It was a windy and cold day. The tide was in and the waves rolling and crashing created a kind of meditative sound. I donrsquot know how long I sat there, as time seemed to dissolve as I listened to the sea, and smelt the salt air.Later I walked by the shore, again alone, and I remember how my mood had changed.My memory of that day fades at this point: I cannot recall what happened as I ed home. But clearly the sea had done its job in calming my emotional state.Memories are not like books on a shelf which we can take out and look at, and then . Our memories are really about emotions rather than happenings. We connect to the emotions first, our brain then does a search for the events associated with the emotion. Songs, smell, sounds and places can trigger emotion which then leads to associations with actual events.So itrsquos the emotion attached to events which will mark it as signicant. Thatrsquos why we remember the unusual moments more than the everyday ones. We remember the events when our emotions were aroused, either positively or negatively.That day I was angry. The sea was pretty much on our doorstep, so it was probably an obvious place to go to be alone, away from my siblings, to rage at the injustice I felt. But it was a good choice, because the sea has a powerful ability to heal.There seems to be a sense by some that the sea is a place to go only when itrsquos sunny and warm. In fact, the gts of the sea are given all year round, and it is winter time, or a time of storm and wind, that the sea becomes a powerful place to find naturersquos healing.How lucky we are to live in a county where we have  miles of coastline, much of it close to communities and accessible. Those with a sense of adventure and physical ability to do so can find parts of the coast to themselves, even in busy times.But as I learnt all those years ago, the sea can speak to us directly. Simply sitting by it, or walking along the shore while sharing our thoughts, can be a powerful form of mental as well as physical healing.Some take this a step further by bathing in the sea on a regular basis ndash yes, even in the winter. There are real benefits to swimming in a cold sea, both in terms of mental and physical health. But I think it helpsothers do it with you, as an encouragement! The Loony Dooks which take place at North Berwick, Dunbar and where around the coast should be a weekly event, not a yearly one!But we donrsquot need to be in the sea to feel its benefits, just by it and connected to it mentally, and yes, spiritually. This is a serious point. We have an epidemic of mental health issues, and while there is no one simple explanation or solution, we need to understand the signicance of our disconnection from nature and its impact on our mental health. Spending time by the sea is a tonic for body and mind.I think we felt this last week when we headed for the rocks at North Berwick on Boxing Day. It was here that Robert Louis Stevenson played as a boy and discovered a small cave in which he imagined tales of pirates and smugglers. The island of Fidra, said to be his inspiration for Treasure Island, can be seen further along the coast.The tide was in, so it wasnrsquot possible to see the cave. But in scrambling over the rocks, discovering other things and sitting by the waves, the sea did its magic for our family and myself. The waves were crashing andyou studied how they hit the rocks you could see how the hand of the sea had carved them in certain ways.We sat and explored there ndash not noticing the nippy wind ndash for a good hour. It was an overcast afternoon and darkness fell soon. But the walk along the beach to the town for a hot chocolate was the final part of the therapy!Our coastline is a gt for us and we need to use it, and respect it, more. The beaches, coves and clfs of our county are a true treasure. Try spending more time with them, listening and experiencing the sea, walking or sitting with it.I promise you, you will feel better, and have a story to tell.Happy New Year."},{"url":null,"title":"new-mcbrave-games-event-held-musselburgh","story":"The action-packed event, called McBrave Games, promises participants a uniquely Scottish experience with events such as tug orsquo war, tossing the caber, putting the shot, the hill race, weechinrsquo the welly and a Highland fling.There will also be a Scottish twist on challenges along the km obstacle course to test participants.The event takes place on Saturday, May , at Newhailes House.Participants can take on the challenge as a solo entrant or enter as a clan of four with colleagues or friends to battle it out to become the laddie or lassie of McBrave Games.Co-founders Jo Dytch and Andrew Hastings are confident the creativity and innovation behind the event will encourage entrants to try something new in .Jo and Andrew bring with them more than  yearsrsquo combined experience in the mass participation space on large-scale events such as Race for Le, Tough Mudder and the -mile Cateran Yomp.Commenting on the inspiration behind the event, Jo said: ldquoScotland is an inspiring and magical place.

is planning to introduce new traffic regulations which will stop people from parking outside spaces in the packed car park.A spokesperson said: ldquoA report will be presented to our cabinet meeting in January with proposals to introduce double yellow lines to the long-stay car park.This is to improve safety and reduce damage to the kerbs and road surfaces caused by indiscriminate parking.ldquoFollowing cabinet, the proposals will be subject to a statutory process before the necessary regulations could be introduced.Last October, the council introduced similar restrictions in its own staff car park at John Muir House, Haddington, which lies a short distance from the long-stay facility.That saw dozens of workers receive fines, from the team of private parking wardens

To say it has been devastating would be the understatement of the year.And while the consensus is that not every extreme weather event can be blamed on climate change, Dr Richard Thornton, chief executive of the Bushfires and Natural Hazards Co-operative Research Centre, noted that with the average temperature in Australia now running around one degree higher than the long-term figure, fire seasons are starting earlier and ldquothe cumulative fire danger is growing. Or, as University of Sydney ecologist Professor Glenda Wardle put it, while not every weather event is the direct result of rising temperatures, ldquowhen you see trends it becomes undeniably linked to global climate change.So why the reticence from Australiarsquos leaders to name the issue, too  Back in November Mr McCormack caused outrage when he dismissed climate concerns as the obsession of ldquoraving inner-city lefties, while prime minister Scott Morrison continues to defend carbon-emissions policies that are widely held to be inadequate for a G member. The reason would seem plain for all to see, with the opportunity for Australia to expand its lucrative role as a leading exporter of fossil fuels apparently making the science just too easy to ignore.It is an unforgivable stance to take, and one that is entirely out of step with the general direction of travel. Indeed, at a time when local and national governments around the world have declared a climate emergency, the onus is on all of us to do our bit to avert the crisis. The younger generation has risen to the challenge, taking to the streets to shame policymakers into taking action. Older generations are making changes too, dumping fossil-fuel companies from their investment portfolios and putting pressure on employers to eliminate them from their pensions.It is not just small investors who are taking more of an interest in what their money is funding, with more and more institutional investors starting to question the moral legitimacy of channelling funds into companies whose activities are contributing to the destruction of the planet. Environmental organisation , which aims to ldquoend the age of fossil fuels, says more than , asset managers, pension funds and insurers have pledged to take such action, the aim being to ldquoremove [companiesrsquo] social licence to operate.The Church of England, which has an pound. billion investment pot at its disposal, is one such investor. In  the churchrsquos General Synod voted by  to four to est its holdings in fossil-fuel companies, with a spokesperson saying at the time that the vote made clear that the church ldquomust play a leading role and exercise its moral leadership on the urgent issue of climate change. Attempts are being made to see the Church of Scotland follow suit. Although last May its General Assembly narrowly rejected a motion that would have seen it disinvest from oil and gas companies, Rev Dr Richard Frazer, convener of the Church and Society Council, has said it must now take action ldquoas a matter of urgency.Writing in The Herald last month, he said the council believes that ldquofor reasons of conscience and out of an urgent necessity to respond to what is happening to our planet, we must accelerate the process of weaning ourselves off our dependence on fossil fuels. ldquoIn taking this decision we have approved a report which we will be commending to next yearrsquos General Assembly, recommending that the Church sells its shares in oil and gas companies as a matter of urgency, he wrote.Yet while Dr Frazer stressed that the council had made its decision based on its deeply held belief that Christians have ldquoa duty to care for Godrsquos earth, will the Kirk actually be able to fulfil that dutyit washes its hands of those companies completely  Surely it would do more good by retaining its investments and using its position as a high-profile investor to drive positive change from within It is certainly the opinion of mega-investor Bill Gates that estment programmes are all but pointless, with the removal of even large sums of money unlikely to have enough of an impact to make oil or gas giants change course. Others, such as Japanrsquos . trillion national pension fund, prefer to engage with the companies they invest in, using their clout as major shareholders to hold management teams to account. It is the right approach: while no amount of engagement will stop a fossil-fuel company being a fossil-fuel company, these businesses like any other can and should be forced to set and achieve emissions-reduction targets.It is worth noting that while the Church of England has sold out of positions in tar sands and thermal coal businesses, it retains large investments in oil majors BP and Royal Dutch Shell. Crucially, it has started voting against the re-election of chairmen of companies such as EOG Resources for doing too little to combat climate change. It is exactly the kind of activism that is needed.Ultimately, while it is clear that carbon emissions from fossil fuels are causing the planet to warm, the only way for fossil-fuel companies to be driven out of existence is for everyone to stop using fossil fuels. As that is not likely to fully happen for many years ndashever ndash it is better that investors like the Church of Scotland use their boardroom influence to ensure those businesses are contributing to the solution rather than just blaming them for creating the problem.It may seem counterintuitive, but the climate crisis will never be solvedeveryone simply stands shouting from the sidelines."},{"url":null,"title":"one-day-little-womens-jo-might-real-equality","story":"Throughout Greta Gerwigs radical new adaptation of Little Women, female economic and social power are questioned and explored, as are the ious effects of marriage on a womans le.What has changed, from then until now Here is Marmee, taking on the unpaid caring role for the entire town.Here is Meg, her domestic labours undermined and undervalued by her husband.Here is Jo, determined to be an independent, single woman, to \"paddle my own canoe\" but being pressured into marriage, questioned relentlessly about why she doesnt want to have a relationship.\"You remind me of myself,\" Marmee tells Jo, following Jos failure to keep a grip on her explosive temper.\"But youre never angry,\" Jo replies.\"Im angry nearly every day of my le,\" Marmee says. And such a lot she had to be angry about, and such a lot we still have to be angry about, particularly when it comes to men and womens equality in relationships.In one furious scene, Laurie, the March sisters neighbour and close friend, has had his marriage proposal rejected by Jo and is now moping around Paris, drinking his grandfathers money and behaving like a spoiled child.He attempts to give Amy a dressing down for her desire to marry into money she is, at that point in the film, awaiting a proposal. Amy will have none of it. There is no way, she tells Laurie, for a woman to earn her own keep. When she marries she will be the property of her husband any property she owns or money she might earn, will be the property of her husband any children she might have will be the property of her husband. Marriage removes a womans legal right to herself.\"Donrsquot sit there,\" she flares at Laurie, \"And tell me that marriage isnrsquot an economic proposition.\"There is the most obvious change between then and now. Women now earn their own keep. Their children belong to them, their property belongs to them. These are changes made more recently than its comfortable to think about, but they are changes the March girls would be astounded by.Marriage was a system designed to control and subdue women, and to limit their economic power.But marriage is still an economic proposition. Marriage comes with great financial risk for women. They are more likely, when children enter the equation, to give up full time work and so limit their earning potential and their pension contributions.According to the Chartered Insurance Institute, the average orced woman has less than a third of the pension wealth of the average orced man.Repeated studies have shown that the benefits of marriage for men far outweigh the benefits for women. Married men are likely to be in better physical and mental health than their single counterparts, have more money and have greater social support networks.For women, there is very little dference in these measures between single and married women, apart from money, where non-married women are better off. Other studies have shown that married women report lower satisfaction levels than co-habiting or single women and are more likely to initiate orce than men.In Louisa May Alcotts Little Women, Jo quits her writing and is married off, a decision Alcott, who never married, said she regretted. Jo should have remained a \"literary spinster\". In Gerwigs film, Jo is given a book.\"What I was trying to reverse-engineer,\" she said. \"Was this moment that Jo getting her book would make the audience feel like you usually feel when the heroine is chosen by the hero. I wanted to seeI could create that feeling, but with a girl and her book.\"It is a perfect ending to a feminist, questioning film. But, in real le, imagine we could move beyond an either or choice for women where a relationship is not a stymie to her creative output or stem from an oppressive institution.Couples are increasingly turning their backs on marriage. Co-habitation is the fastest growing type of relationship in the UK where the number of co-habiting couples has doubled to . million in  years.The risks for women, though, are even greater in an unmarried partnership. There is a general misconception that co-habiting couples have legal rights similar to those of married couples, leaving women and their children vulnerable.In England last week the first mixed-sex civil partnerships took place after a law change brought about following a y campaign by a couple, Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, who wanted a system that gives them legal protections without the patriarchal baggage of marriage.This is common in other parts of the world - from de-facto rights in Australia to Frances civil solidarity pact and mixed-sex civil partnerships in Netherlands, South Africa, New Zealand and the Isle of Man.Here, the Civil PartnershipBill is making its way through parliament to make mixed-sex partnerships legal in Scotland. Around , mixed-sex couples are expected to form civil partnerships next year.For feminists, for the non-religious, for those who want a new structure within which to define their relationships, this is an exciting development and it will be interesting to see how a civil pact, rather than a marriage, changes the way women feel and thrive in their relationships.The ambition of civil partnerships is to create true equality. If the much-adapted Little Women reflects how society feels about women at any given time, perhaps the next iteration will see Jo end up with both her novel and an equal match."},{"url":null,"title":"bafta-nominations-full-joker-leads-11-nods","story":"Scorsese.

Yet despite its continual deployment by all cultures, the usual political response to it has, until very recently, been not only to condemn, but to deny it as a practice.The example of Julius Caesar ndash where none of the conspirators came to power, and all were dead within a few years ndash may be one reason politicians are suspicious of its utility a more obvious one is that any political leader is a potential target.Very few people have mounted a moral defence of assassination. The closest would have been a claim of utility ndash that killing, say, Hitler, might have prevented millions of deaths in war. As with all counterfactuals, no one knows whether that would have been true.Since Hitlerrsquos death, the number of wars, the total killed in them, the number killed in battle and even the number of violent crimes has been declining sharply around the world ndash despite obvious and horric atrocities in Rwanda, Bosnia, Syria and where.Partly that must be because none of the ldquoGreat Powers has been overtly at war with one of the others for five decades, so conflicts are generally on a smaller, localised, scale.Even in those, fewer people are being killed. The figures remain awful: , people, two-thirds of them civilians, were killed last year by explosive weapons alone. But conflict, however horric, is becoming more selective.And consequently, more blatant about assassination. No one doubts that the US, under most presidents, always attempted killings of its enemies, but under Ford, Carter and Reagan, Executive Orders prohibited assassination as a policy.President Clinton was the first openly to advocate targeted strikes . George W Bushrsquos spokesman encouraged the assassination of Saddam Hussein in . Barack Obama was quite open ndash indeed, proud ndash when US forces finally got rid of bin Laden, as was Donald Trump when the ISIS leader Abu al-Baghdadi was killed.The dfering reaction to the death of the Iranian general Qasem Soleimani cannot be because the ethical considerations are dferent. Assassination is either acceptable or not. If, in certain circumstances, it is , he was as well-qualied as bin Laden, both on his atrocities and as an enemy of the US. No one disputes that he was responsible for thousands of deaths, war crimes and terrorist attacks.The only explanation for the dferent reaction is that, by dint of his political position, he was protected from direct attempts on his person: because any regimersquos officialsenjoy a kind of diplomatic immunity except in time of war, or for the connected reason that the consequences have not been considered, so it could be dangerous or counterproductive to kill them.From what we know of Mr Trump, it seems perfectly likely that he has not thought it through. But since wersquore dealing with Realpolitik rather than morality, the USA has a good case for claiming that this was not a provocation, but a reaction.This may have been Iranrsquos second-most powerful man, but he was acting, in other territories, as a terrorist. The US embassy had just been attacked, and sprayed with the Arabic graffiti equivalent of ldquoSoleimani was here. Then Ayatollah Khamenei, calling the US President ldquothis guy on Twitter, taunted him with the words: ldquoYou canrsquot do anything.You donrsquot need to be a fan of Mr Trumprsquos to see this as the kind of provocation the US doesnrsquot normally accept.

A lot of time is spent to-ing and fro-ing in the AE to decide what to do with them.\"That can easily endup being a four-hour, or an eight-hour or a -hour breach.\"This is one of the reasons I tell people not to get so hung up on AE compliance. Invest in social care for the elderly, in general practice, in district nurses. What you need are community-based staff to deal with all this.\"Miles Briggs, Scottish Conservative health spokesman, said: ldquoThese signicant increases in the numbers of patients waiting an extreme amount of time in AE are truly shocking.ldquoIt is particularly dreadful that these waiting times are so long when average attendance hasnrsquot changed very much at all.Monica Lennon, Scottish Labourrsquos health spokeswoman, added: ldquoEmergency medicine experts have been warning for months about a lack of preparedness in our NHS for winter pressures.

It would be completely wrong for us to hand those powers over to the Scottish Parliament because we would end up in a series of neverendums bad for the Scottish, bad for Scottish jobs, reducing tax income and, therefore, damaging already failing public services.One Whitehall source later told The Herald: ldquoIt would be completely irresponsible to hand over the power on referendums as it would paralyse Scotland and Scotlandrsquos economy.In the chamber, Kirsty Blackman, the SNP deputy leader at Westminster, who the party said had taken on the prime constitutional role ldquoin preparation for an independence referendum, claimed the Government had ignored Scottish peoplersquos voices and votes since , ldquocareering on with both Brexit and austerity.She asked Mr Jack what electoral event would convince him that Scotlandrsquos people should have the right to choose their own future.:Relationship between Westminster and Holyrood lsquoat low ebbrsquoThe Scottish Secretary picked up on the austerity issue, saying: ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos own independence figures show there would be a pound.bn hole in the Scottish finances and that would mean real austerity.ldquoRegarding when the time would be right, both Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond said it was a once-in-a-generation, a once-in-a-letime decision. I donrsquot feel a generation or letime have passed.David Mundell, Mr Jackrsquos predecessor at the Scotland Office, said the Scottish Governmentrsquos Right To Choose document was ldquojust another expensive and time-wasting stunt by Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP.He went on: ldquoThe people of Scotland chose in  decisively to remain in the UK and itrsquos time Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP accepted that and moved on.During his tenure at Dover House, the Dumfriesshire MP took Scottish Questions  times."},{"url":null,"title":"airlines-begin-rerouting-flights-amid-escalating-middle-east-tensions","story":"The UK has urged Iran not to carry out further ldquoreckless and dangerous attacks after Tehran fired missiles at military bases in Iraq hosting British and US troops.British Airways rerouted flight  from Mumbai to Heathrow mid-way through the flight, to avoid crossing Iraqi airspace.

Quite simply, there are none more iconic than our own national dish.“We’re fiercely proud of our Scottish roots and so narrowed down to a number of options for a limited run.

He helps to run the family-owned business with his father, Managing Director George Taylor.The crisps brand and Mackie’s at Taypack as a business were launched in  as the result of a joint-venture between potato farmers the Taylor family and Aberdeenshire’s Mackie’s of Scotland, which is renowned for its ice cream and chocolate.Its thick-cut and gently cooked potato crisps use the best ieties of crisping potatoes, grown on the farm, reflective of its “plough to pack” ethos.Subsequently, Mackie’s Crisps has become famous for its haggis and cracked black pepper iety, as well as launching the world’s first pigs in blankets flavour.Research on its new flavour started in earnest in  during a new product development push, after establishing Burns Night as an opening to deliver a new patriotic flavour combination.Meticulous sampling sessions helped it to master the flavour of haggis, neeps and tatties, building on its popular haggis-based flavours.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Members of Inverurie  District Mens Shed accept the donation from Barratt Homes\"  Funding boost for Inverurie Men’s Shed viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"The Mackie’s Crisps team were further convinced of launching the flavour when a student, Aileen McColm, joined the Perthshire business in  to shadow quality control manager Jamie McKell.

People in Orkney will be shocked to hear how often those making emergency calls are being forced to wait due to a lack of land ambulance cover. In many instances, these will be cases where the response time can be critical.“This is absolutely no criticism of Orkney’s ambulance crews, who do outstanding work in operating a service that is clearly over-stretched. Indeed, the admission from the Minister about the scale of the problem shows that local crews are being let down by a lack of resources and support. This can only be making an already dficult job even more challenging.“I am due to meet senior representatives of the Scottish Ambulance Service early next month. I will make clear the need for an urgent review into the resources available locally and calling for additional capacity to meet the needs of the Orkney community.

Leagues and clubs continue to govern their own relationships with gambling companies. Bet said in a statement: ldquoBet does not sponsor the FA or the FA Cup and does not have any direct commercial agreement with the FA. bet, along with multiple other operators, has the right to live stream certain FA Cup matches through a long standing media rights deal with IMG.ldquoThere is no obligation on betrsquos customers to place a bet on any FA Cup match to enjoy the live streams at bet.To do so, customers are simply required to either have a funded bet account or to have placed a bet on any event with bet in the previous  hours. This requirement importantly ensures that all such customers are fully veried to prevent under s from accessing the service.ldquoBet believes that these streaming services provide added value to its customers and enable them to watch FA Cup matches that they might not otherwise have been able to see.Last weekendrsquos third-round matches all signposted the Heads Up campaign, a joint initiative between the FA and the charity Heads Together, spearheaded by William.All fixtures other than the  that kicked off at .pm on Saturday were screened live by Bet, including Liverpoolrsquos derby against Everton and Arsenal versus Leeds.National mental health director for the NHS Claire Murdoch said: ldquoBet to view is simply wrong and needs to stop. Football needs to rethink its relationship with the betting industry and reconsider gamblingrsquos role in the beautul game.ldquoThis is another own-goal from the gambling industry.ldquoBetting firms talk a good game when it comes to tackling addiction but it is no wonder that ndash with tactics like these ndash more people are seeking help for gambling problems on the NHS.ldquoThe NHS never stands still as health needs change, which is why wersquore rolling out new specialist services to tackle mental ill-health linked to gambling addiction, as part of our Long Term Plan, but it is high time that all these firms who spend many millions on marketing and advertising step up to the plate and take their responsibilities seriously.The Royal Society for Public Healthsaid the deal ldquodemonstrates the need for a complete overhaul of regulation around sports and gambling.Chief executive Shirley Cramer said: ldquoThis is a rotten deal from start to finish, and it is extremely disappointing that the FA has been such a willing participant in the gamblication of football. Football has played an historic role in unying our society, yet problem gambling and gambling disorder can tear families and communities apart, and has led to the loss of far too many lives already.ldquoThe reality is that lives are at risk now and waiting until  is not good enough ndash urgent action is needed to prevent further harm and the FA must work to scrap this harmful deal without delay. The Bishop of St Albans, Dr Alan Smith, described the situation as ldquoextraordinary.He said: ldquoThis plan puts gambling at the very core of broadcast football and may be unilaterally breaking gambling firmsrsquo ad ban ndash made only last year.ldquoItrsquos extraordinary that football bosses are allowing bookies to carry out this wholesale lsquogamblicationrsquo of our national sport. Football bosses will have to explain themselves, not least to parents and young people.ldquoAdvertising and promoting gambling is widely understood to be linked with levels of gambling-related harm which are damaging public health at unprecedented levels. Promoting this harm must not be the fate for the national, beautul game.ldquoYet it is only through paper-thin regulation that this happened. The regulators have said they would stand against this direction of travel, so they too must provide an explanation.Malcolm Clarke, chairman of The Football Supportersrsquo Association, said: ldquoThis deal highlights the major concerns fans have about the growth of gambling in football ndash governing bodies need to take these concerns seriously.ldquoThrough our partnership with GambleAware, we are taking real steps to promote safer gambling in football and we call on the FA to get around the table on the issue. There is much more to be done to protect fans from the risks of gambling.In December it was revealed that Bet chief executive Denise Coates had kept her place as the highest-paid boss in the country after pocketing a pound million basic pay rise last year and taking home abasic salary of almost pound million in the year ended March .It comes on top of the around pound million she is believed to have received in idends as a major shareholder.copy -.

Così fan tutte has an unlikely plot but the most sublime music. That spell-binding trio, Soave sia il vento, is exquisitely moving although it is sung against a background of deception and a silly scheme. The plot of Wagner’s Ring is similarly absurd, and yet is elevated by the power of the music to something extraordinary. But who amongst us knows much about Lorenzo da Ponte, who was Mozart’s librettist  I did not, until I chanced upon Anthony Holden’s The Man who Wrote Mozart, an account of the le of the librettist of The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni and, of course, Così. Few who see his name on the score of these operas will be aware of the fact that da Ponte ended up as a grocer in New York – amongst other things.This is not to say that the librettist is unimportant – he or she may play a vital role in setting the emotional tone of the opera, or indeed inspiring it in the first place. Sometimes the spadework is done by a novelist – Benjamin Britten’s Death in Venice would not have been written were it not for Thomas Mann’s novella. Or the librettist may play an important role in establishing the basic argument of the piece: Nixon in China by John Adams was the product of discussions between composer, director and librettist, out of which the fundamental moral position of the piece was forged – one that treated Nixon’s trip as a serious matter and not just a ploy.: Alexander McCall Smith: This column is private and not to be read: Alexander McCall Smith: Remember, but don’t repeat, the crimes of historyOn occasions, the libretto may assert itself as a work of literary signicance in its own right, and not just as an adjunct to a musical composition. Auden’s libretto for Stravinsky’s The Rake’s Progress is worth reading as a self-standing work. The same goes for his libretto for Britten’s Paul Bunyan.Tolerance grows with ageI came to appreciate opera as a student. Like many, I benefited from the cheap tickets one could get for Scottish Opera’s performances at the King’s Theatre. My experience was broadened by the occasional treat where – including a performance of Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci in Rome, which I experienced, seated in the upper, upper circle next to an ancient musician – a retired conductor, perhaps – who had the score on his knee and vigorously conducted and hummed the music throughout. I was too young to go with the flow and share his transport of delight. For most of us, tolerance is something that grows with age. Today I would revel in such an experience.When, many years later, I devoted my time to writing, it occurred to me that it would be interesting to write material for musicians to set to music. I had met Tom Cunningham, an Edinburgh choral composer, whose work has an immediate appeal to it. So, when I had the idea of writing an operatic libretto, it was to Tom that I turned.The way it came about was highly peculiar. I was visiting the Okavango Delta in northern Botswana with my American agent, Robin Straus, and my New York editor, Edward Kastenmeier. I had long wanted to show them Botswana, since by then. they had been working on the Botswana books for some years. We were in a small boat going upriver when I happened to see a few huts in thick vegetation on the river bank, some distance away. I asked our guide, Mighty, what the settlement was and he replied, “That’s the baboon people.”The penny dropped. I have a very amateurish interest in primatology and I had just read a book by two American primatologists, Baboon Metaphysics. It must be the most obscure title published in recent years, but, as it happened, I had read it. I realised that this was the very camp at which the two primatologists in question – a husband and we team from Pennsylvania – were living with their troop of baboons.The No  Ladies’ Opera HouseI managed to persuade Mighty to take us ashore. As we approached, I cupped my hands and shouted out across the water, “I’ve just read Baboon Metaphysics!”The effect was immediate. Out of the huts there rushed the two primatologists, who then made us tea and told us all about their research. In the course of this they mentioned that female baboons could be very ambitious for their male partner. Lady Macbeth! That idea stuck in my mind, and there, on the banks of a river in the middle of Africa, the idea came of writing an operatic libretto setting the Macbeth story in a troop of baboons in Africa...Tom wrote some magnicent music and we premiered The Okavango Macbeth in a tiny opera housein the bush outside Gaborone. This opera house, which we ran for five years, had  home-made seats and was called The No  Ladies’ Opera House. It gave great joy to the amateur groups who used it for concerts of ious sorts. It was there that we mounted the first opera ever translated into the local language, Setswana. That was Cavalleria Rusticana.The same team went on to do The Tumbling Lassie, a chamber opera based on the story of a young girl held in slavery in late th century Scotland, and, most recently Dandie Dinmont, an operatic version of Walter Scott’s Guy Mannering. We are now doing a children’s opera for the Scotland-Malawi project, based on Livingstone’s travels in Africa. There is also a collaboration with Tom Hyde, a London-based composer. This is all about the disappearance of Lord Lucan.

Emergency legislation may now be required to have this suspended.MSPs now face a race against time to agree Scotland’s dferent tax rates and pass a budget before the end of March. The SNP’snormal budget partners, the Greens, are already threatening to block any spending plans which don’t include radical climate change proposals.The Scottish Government would normally begin its three-stage budget process with publication of Mr Mackay’s spending plans in mid-December, but the UK election saw this delayed.Although accepting a delay was inevitable, Mr Mackay questioned why it had to be as late as mid-March.He added: “The UK government’s approach to the Scottish budget is completely unacceptable – the delay of over four months since their original planned date cannot be blamed on the general election, and suggests a disregard for devolution and a lack of fiscal responsibility.”The UKBudget would normally be set in October or November, allowing good time for the devolved administration to assess their own budgets.Although a deal is likely to be struck,MSPs cannot reach agreement, it would jeopardise HMRC’s ability to collect income tax in Scotland.A spokesman for Mr Mackay added: “The single-biggest danger – however unlikely – isthe Parliament doesn’t pass a rate resolution in time then there is no authority to collect income tax, so that’s a £bn risk.”The UK government says it has already shared estimates of tax and welfare block grant adjustments based on latest forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibilitylast month to aid Scottish Government budget preparations.A Treasury spokesman said: “Nothing stops the Scottish Parliament from passing their budget before the UK Budget.“At the Spending Round, we announced that the Scottish Government’s block grant will increase by £.bn next year.”Scotland’s local government body Cosla attacked the decision.Cosla resources spokeswoman Gail Macgregor said: “By delaying the UK budget until mid-March, the UK government is putting thousands of essential public services at risk of going without funding.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"transport chiefs admit unwanted queensferry crossing traffic increase","story":"It followed Scotland on Sunday revealing last month that more than one million extra journeys had been made over the new bridge in the last year.That came despite ministers pledging that any cross-Forth growth would be by public transport after the replacement for the Forth Road Bridge opened in .MSPs were also told today that only nine of  planned measures to improve cross-Forth bus travel and other public transport as part of a strategy had yet been completed.These include reserving the Forth Road Bridge for buses, taxis, cyclists and walkers.BACKGROUND: Bus work lsquoincompletersquo as Forth Road Bridge starts new roleTransport Scotland director of transport strategy and analysis Alison Irvine confirmed the traffic figure to the Scottish Parliaments connectivity committee.She said: \"Its not the direction we would want the travel to go in\".Traffic less than forecastHowever, the Scottish Government agency official said current traffic levels were less than the anticipated increase fuelled by factors such as economic growth.She said: \"Traffic flows are less than we forecast.\"That does not step away from the fact they are increasing, which is not what we wanted to achieve.\"A total of . million vehicles used the Queensferry Crossing in the year to last October compared to .m the previous year.Ms Irvine said the new bridge added no additional capacity compared to its predecessor, and there were no intention to use its hard shoulders to ease peak-hour congestion.She said it was \"more reliable and resilient\" than the old bridge, such as because of windshielding to avert closures during strong winds.However, she added: \"We have always had a focus on promoting public transport across the corridor.\"We are seeing early signs that the public transport strategy is encouraging more people to travel by sustainable modes.\"Ms Irvine said that the public transport measures not being finished was not a failure as some were to be implemented over longer timescalesFantastic success storyStagecoach Scotland East, the main bus operator over the Forth Road Bridge, said passenger growth had accelerated to a  per cent increase over the last three months.It forecast the annual total would increase from .m to m by next year.Managing director Douglas Robertson said: \"We are seeing a big step change in demand on cross-Forth services.\"Its been a fantastic success story.\"He said there had been no signicant reduction in journey times but they were now more consistent.Previous congestion on the Forth Road Bridge could y them by half an hour.City of Edinburgh Council transport and planning manager Ewan Kennedy said adding bus lanes was not the answer because it just moved traffic onto other roads.Instead, he said travellers must be given a better choice between driving and taking public transport.Scottish Greens transport spokesman John Finnie said: ldquoThis evidence makes clear the Queensferry Crossing has not resolved congestion issues into Edinburgh.\"Why would it  Wersquove known since the s that building more roads increases traffic.ldquoThe growth in traffic is just not sustainable and it is clearly impacting on communities.\"The Scottish Government must listen to the experts. Bus lanes and road allocation isnrsquot going to solve the issue on its own.ldquoIn a climate emergency, there needs to be regular, reliable and integrated public transport so that it becomes the easiest option.\"Thatrsquos why the Scottish Greens propose public ownership and phasing in free bus travel.Chris Day, policy adviser at sustainable transport campaigners Transform Scotland, said: Transport Scotland said nine of  public transport schemes had been completed.\"We look forward to getting the details.\"The other ten schemes were long term. The crossing was approved in , and the first public transport strategy in , so this is clearly very long term indeed.\"It was clear even these ten were at an early stage of development, and hopes of funding them rely on the [Transport Scotland] strategic transport projects review or the Edinburgh city region deal.\"So theyll still be competing for funds with many other projects across Scotland.\"This doesnt look like the balanced managed crossing strategy it was supposed to be.\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"caravan vandalised in north ness ","story":"Police are investigating after a caravan in North Ness was vandalised.The incident took place in Lerwick between Saturday th December and Monday th December., where a house in Charlotte Lane had pipes ripped off its walls over the festive period.Anyone with information about either of these incidents should contact  or go to Lerwick police station..."},{"url":null,"title":"parkour groups fitting tribute gets community backing ","story":"A memorial bench dedicated to a young man who died in a tragic accident last year could soon be placed in Lerwick., owned by British billionaire Sir Jim Ratclfe, at the time of his death.Northern Focus Parkour, a group Mr Connor was a part of and coached for, has now applied for permission to place a bench in the town in memory of their friend, as a “fitting tribute”.The application for the bench was discussed at Lerwick Community Council on Monday, where community councillors gave the idea their full support, with no objections.The parkour group would like to place the bench in Heddle’s Park, replacing one of the old wooden slat benches, and said it would be a “fitting tribute for friends and family of Ray to come and remember him for what he loved to do”.The spot was one of the group’s favourite places to train, according to the application, which goes on to describe the influence that Mr Connor had on people around him: “Ray was a very well liked and respected inidual in Shetland who helped the group coach around Shetland and even in Orkney at Kirkwall Grammar School with hundreds of students being taught by him.”.."},{"url":null,"title":"carmichael demands comprehensive response to soleimani assassination ","story":"Liberal Democrat Alistair Carmichael.Mr Carmichael spoke of his fears that British citizens will be put a “further risk” as tensions escalate between Washington and Tehran.He demanded a comprehensive response from the government to the deepening crisis which has led to exchanges of threats between the two countries.Mr Carmichael said: “It is hard to see what President Trump seeks to achieve by this assassination.“That is not to condone Soleimani’s past actions or, for that matter, the actions of the Iranian government.

But away from Stormont it’s clear that the PSNI and its still relatively new Chief Constable have a lot of work to do in order to undo the damage done in what’s been a year of reversals and missteps for an organisation that appears to have lost its direction and purpose. Not to put too fine a point on it, it’s been a disaster for the PSNI vis a vis its relationship with the nationalist community. The support the new policing arrangements were given to allow devolution to forge ahead was contingent on a number of factors, most of which have either fallen by the wayside or are being flagrantly disregarded. At the most basic level, the urgent requirement for the policing service to reflect the community it serves has never been met –on the contrary, it now appears to be in reverse with calls growing for ato - recruitment. Coming two decades after the formation of the PSNI, this is desperately disappointing and places a question mark over the very concept of fair and balanced policing. But to make things immeasurably worse, the performance of Simon Byrne in the top job has led many to question the wisdom of his appointment. Any casual observation of recent history will reveal that there is no appetite within the nationalist political family for knee-jerk targeting of new PSNI Chief Constables. But when the PSNI needs to be held to account it is held to account in a robust and positive manner – the legacy issue being a recurring source of contention. But in the seven months since Mr Byrne took on the role, we’ve seen an extraordinary series of what we might charitably call unfortunate events – some cynical and deliberate acts, some common or garden incompetence – which have been incredibly debilitating to law and order in the north and which mean that the coming year is one in which his ability to see out his contract is going to be put under very serious scrutiny. First and most worrying is Mr Byrne’s increasing determination to use the PSNI as a bulwark against progress on the aforementioned legacy issue. His decision to go the Supreme Court to appeal adverse rulings on legacy investigations has seen him park the PSNI tank on the lawn of victims and survivors. His extraordinarily brutish threat to take children away from their parents quite frankly left some experienced observers here open-mouthed in astonishment. And his handling of summer bonfire issues – in particular the Avoniel and New Lodge stand-offs – underlined concerns around whether he’s possessed of the necessary insight and tactical nous to lead the PSNI forward. And to put the tin hat on an annus horribilis for policing here, Mr Byrne decided to pose for a Christmas pic with heavily armed officers at Crossmaglen barracks, to the consternation of nationalist politicians. Entirely unsurprising entirely unacceptable. Possibly fixable possibly terminal."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"danny baker to takes over as lord mayor of belfast","story":"SINN Féin Councillor Danny Baker has officially been installed as Mayor of Belfast. The Colin area representative has replaced newly elected MP for North Belfast John Finucane.Co-opted to Belfast City Council in Janaury , the -year-old told the Andersonstown News that it will be a “huge honour” to represent the people of Belfast.“What can I say, it’s amazing,” he said. “I’m honoured to have been asked by Sinn Féin to be the next Ard Mhéara of Belfast. “I have been an activist in the Colin area since I was . I’m very much about grassroots politics and that theme is something I want to continue. “I want to use the office of Mayor to bring politics from the ground up.” Having topped the council election poll in May, Danny spoke of how he will be continuing the civic work of party colleague John Finucane. “The role of Mayor is city-wide, I want to be a Mayor for all communities and to represent everybody. I want to champion the need for improvements to our mental health services. It’s something that has really impacted the Colin area. I want to use the office of Mayor to help in whatever way I can.

I want to pay tribute to outgoing Ard Mhéara John Finucane.

No worries. I can’t even think of how I’ll start pronouncing your very dficult Irish first name. Foreigners will take time to digest the following Gaelic names: Caoimhe, Oisín, Siobhán, Niamh and a host of others. There is a historical context to this and this could just be the colonial remnants that were left in Africa as official languages! But that’s not an excuse, we must spell your names correctly and we hope you compliment migrants likewise. Udhi nade jo Belfast  . Its dholuo language spoken by people of the Luo community. The Luos were split around the East African borders of Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda South Sudan by migration southwards and during the remapping of Africa in . That’s a story for another day. Luo is among hundreds of dferent African languages and dialects spoken in Belfast. Most Africans are in many cases authoritatively bilingual, spoken and written, no supernatural powers there, just a fact of le and that’s before you include the colonial language English, French etc, so effectively trilingual. In many encounters Africans residing in Ireland are often politely teased with the query, can you speak African please  Honestly, we don’t get offended by that question, generally the interlocutor would probably have assumed that “Africa” is a Pan-African language. I wish! The continent has over , languages, dialects and subcultures. Notwithstanding, the four countries listed above are just a small fraction of African nationalities in Belfast. There are many. The population of perhaps the total sum of  African countries as represented in Belfast could be in the thousands – although being hypothetical is not my cup of tea. West and North Belfast are probably the more African by headcount, followed by South and then East of the city. Some African countries are more visible than others here and we shall come to that in one of my future writings here at Andersonstown News. I just can’t wait. There is so much to explore in the lives of Africans in West and the rest of Belfast when you are inside the broth, it is the freshness you will get in this column moving forward, the smell, beauty and finesse of Africa. Having authored articles on migration in this past decade, it will certainly be a new environment to revisit, new faces, adults and also growing youthful population of first, second and third generation people who were either born in Africa or strongly identy with the continent because of family ties, social or legal reasons. n Elly Omondi Odhiambo is a freelance writer based in Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the ghost of policing past visits","story":"I WRITE this column on the th anniversary of the murder of Fearghal Caraher from Cullyhanna. Mr Caraher had been the victim of systemic harassment by the RUC in the lead-in to the Royal Marines shooting him dead. The harassing RUC were based at Crossmaglen Barracks. Sited beside Crossmaglen Rangers GAA club, RUC officers and British army soldiers had to be flown in via helicopter in military operations. All while the people who actually lived in the place trained, played and socialised in the GAA grounds on its doorstep. It was a physical epitome of occupation. Social media at Christmas is usually the pretty standard fare of hope and goodwill to all. Sadly, the PSNI’s Chief Constable social media was a wholly dferent offering, echoing Christmases Past in South Armagh. His pictures came from Crossmaglen , a strange choice of venue given the PSNI barracks in Crossmaglen has transformed from the days of conflict and is only open a few hours a week. Tuesday and Thursday from am-pm and on a Saturday from pm-pm. Not Wednesdays, not Christmas Day . But it was not the out-of-hours visit that caused people to stop in their tracks. It was the picture of Mr Byrne with four of his colleagues, two of them posing with heavy-duty rles. It was reminiscent of the heavy, dark days of conflict when the RUC would stand posing in their militarised version of disgraced policing. And all of the resulting echoes of the RUC, militarisation, shoot-to-kill and disgrace evoked by those photographs were heard loud and clear on Christmas Day as we read the tweet in disbelief. The response was unanimous from the population of Crossmaglen and the politicians that represent it: that it was ill-judged at best, and in no way reflected the contextual reality for modern policing. The wider response from commentators, journalists and others on social media was equally swt. This was an unwarranted, unhelpful and bizarre tweet and another misstep from a tone-deaf Chief Constable. This was in further evidence on St Stephen’s Day when he refused to withdraw the tweet and issued a statement justying the display of heavy weaponry as reflecting the terrorist threat his officers operate with. Presumably on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and Saturday evenings. It insulted the intelligence of anyone with half a genuine concern. His response displays the signs of a a weak man trying to act hard and when called out refuses to accept responsibility and blames the “bad boys”. The six counties have never had acceptable policing. Policing has always operated at dferent stages of history to reinforce British occupation: the Protestant State for a Protestant People since partition British military policy during the conflict and extremely sinister policies of shoot to kill and collusion. The PSNI is meant to be the new beginning we deserve and need. Human rights-compliant, accountable, community-based, responsive and supported policing that meets our needs as a community in its entirety. Many of us have tried to make that potential a reality. This Chief Constable doesn’t get it and, most worryingly of all, he appears to be too arrogant in his approach to learn. If policing was in crisis under George Hamilton for its defence of the RUC, which it was, then things have worsened under the clueless Mr Byrne."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":null,"title":"forget bridge tunnel best way to link northern ireland and great britain say experts","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Instead, they favour the construction of a tunnel under the Irish Sea. In fact, the plan is for two tunnels - one from England to the Isle of Man, and a second from the Isle of Man to Co Down.They say their proposal would be better than a bridge, as a rail tunnel would not be at the mercy of bad weather, and would avoid the problems in spanning Beaufort Dyke, a deep sea trench in the North Channel containing a million tonnes of dumped wartime munitions.The plan is part of a broader list of tunnel projects put forward by the society. They include a tunnel from Hampshire to the Isle of Wight, another under the Bristol Channel between the West Country and Wales, and a new tunnel under the Thames.Bill Grose, lead author of the ICE report, told the Sunday Times: \"A tunnel starting north of Liverpool that surfaced in the Isle of Man and then went back under to reach Belfast would solve all the problems\" he said.\"Tunnels are less prone to bad weather, and construction is getting faster and cheaper every year.\"The distance from England to the Isle of Man is around  miles, and from the Isle of Man to Northern Ireland is just over  miles.Mr Grose, a former chairman of the British Tunnelling Society, added: \"As prices continue to fall, tunnels will become increasingly attractive as a way of connecting the United Kingdom.\"It cost about £m per kilometre for a twin rail tunnel, but costs are falling. When we reduce them by another %, tunnelling will become popular and very long tunnels become feasible.\"Tunnels and bridges cost much the same - but tunnels are not prone to bad weather.\"The ambitious proposals are surfacing as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is known to be interested in major construction projects to unite the UK in the post-Brexit era.In September last year it was learned that Mr Johnson had asked Government officials for advice on the costs and risks of building a bridge from Scotland to Northern Ireland.Initial estimates put the cost at around £bn.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

industrial action by health workers has heaped pressure on the political leaders to get back into a devolved Assembly.Thousands of nurses are on picket lines at hospitals across Northern Ireland amid

the most recent talks process, which got under way following the UK general election.Sinn Fein has previously demanded a stand-alone Irish Language Act as a prerequisite of any deal to restore devolution.The DUP has expressed a willingness to legislate to protect the language, but only as part of broader culture laws which also include the Ulster Scots tradition.The long-running dispute has boiled down to whether new laws are contained in a stand-alone Bill or as part of a wider piece of legislation."},{"url":null,"title":"shuttle bus rams psni patrol after passengers taken hostage in

Find out more about the new licencing scheme, which includes mandatory safety controls ⬇️ https:t.co QgKBzGv pic AxpiOXH— Scot Gov FairerJanuary , The measures are being introduced following concerns about the impact such lets have on areas such as Edinburgh – one of the most popular places for Airbnb listings.Just over halfof all Airbnb  properties in Scotland are either located in the city or the Highlands.Announcing the changes, Mr Stewart said: “I believe that these measures allow us to make progress in this Parliament to address a pressing issue for some of our communities but they will not unduly curtail the many benefits of short-term lets to hosts, visitors and the Scottish economy.”The Scottish Government will monitor the impact of the moves, with Mr Stewart saying he could come back with legislationproblems persist.He said: “Short-term lets can offer people a flexible travel option and have contributed positively to Scotland’s tourism industry and local economies across the country.“However, we know that in certain areas, particularly tourist hot spots, high numbers of short-term lets are causing problems and often make it harder for people to find homes to live in.“That is why we are empowering local authorities to implement a system that works for their area.“By giving councils the power to set conditions around short-term lets licences and put in place planning control areas to tackle hot spots, communities across Scotland will be able to decide what is best for them and their local economy.”We have been calling for three things to stop holiday lets destroying our communities: new taxes, landlord registration, and limits on the number of holiday lets. Today the Scottish Government has announced actions on all of these: https:t.co RnciwIHi— Living RentJanuary , Mr Stewart added: “Everybody wants visitors, hosts, neighbours and local residents to be safe.“That is why the licensing scheme includes a safety element which will be mandatory across Scotland for all short-term lets.”Edinburgh City Council leader Adam McVey said the changes were “extremely welcome news” and would “give us the controls that we need over short-term lets for our residents and communities across Edinburgh”.He said: “Today’s announcement by the minister meets our request for mandatory licences and we will now be in a position to more effectively implement planning controls to stop the increase of short-term lets.“A review of taxation of short-term lets will also make sure that businesses are paying properly for income they’re receiving and local services they’re using.”He added: “We’ll now work with the Scottish Government on the details of the new system, which I hope will allow us to react quickly when rules are breached as well as addressing the particular challenges we face in Edinburgh, such as housing being taken out of supply, rising rents and antisocial behaviour.” with party co-leader Patrick Harvie. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Green MSP Andy Wightmanwith party co-leader Patrick Harvie. Andy Wightman, the Green MSP for the Lothians, who has campaigned for better regulation of short-term lets, said he was pleased ministers had acted.He added: “Those communities who have been adversely impacted by short-term lets will be pleased that the Government has now committed to introducing a much-needed, long overdue licensing scheme by .”But the Scottish Conservatives were cautious, saying: “Regulation is necessary but there are next to no details on how this might work.“For example, we don’t even knowcouncils will be able to refuse licences or on what grounds.“There is a danger that we could have a triple tax whammy on tourismthe SNP introduces an Airbnb tax on top of a tourist tax and a fee for licences.”Housing campaigners said the changes were a “welcome first step”.Graeme Brown, the director of homeless charity Shelter Scotland, said the “unregulated growth” of short-term lets “has led to too many people being locked out of homes that could be let privately to help tackle Scotland’s housing emergency”.Megan Bishop from Living Rent, Scotland’s tenants’ union, hailed the announcement as a “huge step forward for tenants in Scotland”."},{"url":null,"title":"travelex list of affected high street banks","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He met two men at a hotel and then took a bullet train to Osaka before boarding a private jet hidden inside a case for musical equipment. He flew to Istanbul and was then transferred on to another plane bound for Beirut, where he arrived on December .Ghosn portrayed his arrest as a plot linked to a decline in the financial performance of Nissan. He had been in favour of merging Nissan with industry ally Renault, of which he was also chairman.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Grab of a photo made available by IHA of packing crates, one of which IHA claims Nissan’s fugitive ex-boss Carlos Ghosn used to hide to escape from Japan “Unfortunately there was no trust. And some of our Japanese friends thought that the only way to get rid of Renault in Nissan is to get rid of me,” he said.“I should never have been arrested in the first place,” he said.“I’m not above the law and I welcome the opportunity for the truth to come out and have my name cleared,” he told a packed room of journalists.Ghosn said he would be ready to stand trial “anywhere where I think I can have a fair trial”. He declined to say what country that might be.Lebanon last week received an Interpol-issued wanted notice – a non-binding request to law enforcement agencies worldwide that they locate and provisionally arrest a fugitive.Lebanon and Japan do not have an extradition treaty, and the Interpol notice does not require Lebanon to arrest him. Lebanese authorities have said Ghosn entered the country on a legal passport, casting doubt on the possibility they would hand him over to Japan.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Carlos Ghosn faces the media At the request of the Japanese government, Interpol published the notice on its website on Wednesday as Ghosn was giving his news conference. The notice was previously only sent to Interpol’s member governments but not shared with the public.Ghosn, who is Lebanese and also holds French and Brazilian passports, was expected to go on trial in Tokyo in April. In earlier statements, he has said he fled to avoid “political persecution” by a “rigged Japanese justice system”. He also said that he alone organised his departure from Japan and that his we Carole played no role.On Tuesday, Tokyo prosecutors obtained an arrest warrant for Mrs Ghosn on suspicion of perjury. That charge is not related to his escape. Lebanon’s justice minister said Lebanon has not received any request related to that warrant.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Journalists outside the house of Carlos Ghosn in Beirut Japanese justice officials acknowledge that it is unclear whether the Ghosns can be brought back to Japan to face charges.Ghosn’s former employer, Nissan Motor Co, said it was still pursuing legal action against him despite his escape, adding that Ghosn engaged in serious misconduct while leading the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance. Ghosn denies all the charges.In France, meanwhile, prosecutors are investigating a ,-eurogt from the chateau of Versailles to Ghosn, linked to a lavish party there. Renault alerted French authorities after a company investigation found that Ghosn personally benefited from “an exchange worth , euros in the framework of a philanthropic accord signed with the Chateau of Versailles”.Renault said in June that an internal audit with partner Nissan found  million eurosin questionable expenses at their Dutch-based holding linked to Ghosn. The two carmakers recommended legal action in the Netherlands, where the alliance is based, and ordering Ghosn himself to reimburse the company for some of the expenses.Earlier in the day, Tokyo prosecutors raided a Japanese lawyer’s office where Ghosn had visited regularly before he fled. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Carlos Ghosn and his we Carole Japanese media reports said prosecutors were likely to have seized a computer to track down how Ghosn escaped and who might have helped him.An hour before the scheduled press conference, a Lebanese prosecutor said Ghosn will be summoned “in the coming hours” over a visit to Israel more than  years ago, according to the state-run National News Agency.Two Lebanese lawyers had submitted a report to the Public Prosecutor’s Office against Ghosn last week, saying he violated Lebanese law by visiting Israel. The two neighbouring countries are technically in a state of war. Prosecutor Ghassan Khoury met with the two lawyers who filed the case on Wednesday and asked them to bring additional evidence, adding he would summon Ghosn in the coming hours.Ghosn visited Israel in  and met officials including the prime minister and the president.

The extraordinary potential of this city and our people has been left undeveloped for far too long. My priority is delivering new jobs, investment and infrastructure that will provide everyone living here with the opportunity to fulfil their ambitions. It starts with the expansion of our university to give young people the chance to study, work and build a le for themselves here.

His kick-outs were ied and accurate.  – Karl McKaigue Adrian Mullen scored - in Ballyhales campaign but McKaigue kept him to just two touches in the first-half before also holding Eoin Cody scoreless after the break.  – Shane McGuigan Tasked with picking up TJ Reid, McGuigan held him to a point from play and followed him when he went to full-back after half-time. An imposing performance. googletag.cmd.push  - Pearse Dallas Dallas held Conaghys Bill Murphy scoreless in Saturdays All-Ireland semi-final. As his side gathered early second-half momentum, he got involved in their plans.  – Enda Downey More renowned as a forward, Downey basked in the freedom of a role at wing-back where his relentless workrate helped Lavey build from defence.  – Gerald Bradley – Swept up a series of Ballyhale attacks in the first-half of Sundays epic All-Ireland semi-final clash. Pushed up on Ronan Corcoran for Dean Masons puck-outs.  – Conleth McShane McShane was the dynamo in the middle third for Derry Us draw against Donegal. He saw a goal chance come off the post and passed to Tiarnaacuten McHugh for his goal. googletag.cmd.push  – Chrissy McKaigue If anyone wanted to know the pitch of Slaughtneils challenge, they needed to look no further than the skippers opening point and he led by example throughout. He was dominant on Conor Walsh before the Ballyhale man was replaced at the break.  – Jamie Duggan For the second game in a row, he blotted out the oppositions star man but his time he weighed in with two points to put Lavey on track for Ulster glory.  - SL McGoldrick Landed - in the Eoghan Rua cause and played deep to counteract the Conahy midfield influence but was still able to contribute to their attacking game.  – Finatan Bradley Bradley was an effective link in Derrys half-forward line. He handled more than his fair share of possession. Was moved to centre-back late on and the Oakleafers missed him when he was black-carded.  – Kealan Friel The Bellaghy man thumped over a brilliant score but wasnt afraid to muck in and work. His long kicking bypassed Donegals sweeper and he used his strength to stop the runner in the first-half.  - Calum Downey For the third game of Laveys run to Ulster glory, Downey was the fulcrum of their attack. Every ball played in stuck to him and he scored two vital points of his own.  – Brendan Rogers Rogers started inside but still was able to peel wide and win puck-outs. He scored a point off his left side, before hitting a wonder score off this right at the end of a lung-busting run and his inidual goal gave Slaughtneil a chance of victory late on.  - Brian Cassidy Cassidy kept his best performance of the season for the biggest challenge that came knocking on the Slaughtneil door. Pinged three points and put Richie Reid on the back foot throughout. Worked hard to cover midfield when Gerald Bradley dropped back.

His kick-outs were ied and accurate.  – Karl McKaigue Adrian Mullen scored - in Ballyhales campaign but McKaigue kept him to just two touches in the first-half before also holding Eoin Cody scoreless after the break.  – Shane McGuigan Tasked with picking up TJ Reid, McGuigan held him to a point from play and followed him when he went to full-back after half-time. An imposing performance. googletag.cmd.push  - Pearse Dallas Dallas held Conaghys Bill Murphy scoreless in Saturdays All-Ireland semi-final. As his side gathered early second-half momentum, he got involved in their plans.  – Enda Downey More renowned as a forward, Downey basked in the freedom of a role at wing-back where his relentless workrate helped Lavey build from defence.  – Gerald Bradley – Swept up a series of Ballyhale attacks in the first-half of Sundays epic All-Ireland semi-final clash. Pushed up on Ronan Corcoran for Dean Masons puck-outs.  – Conleth McShane McShane was the dynamo in the middle third for Derry Us draw against Donegal. He saw a goal chance come off the post and passed to Tiarnaacuten McHugh for his goal. googletag.cmd.push  – Chrissy McKaigue If anyone wanted to know the pitch of Slaughtneils challenge, they needed to look no further than the skippers opening point and he led by example throughout. He was dominant on Conor Walsh before the Ballyhale man was replaced at the break.  – Jamie Duggan For the second game in a row, he blotted out the oppositions star man but his time he weighed in with two points to put Lavey on track for Ulster glory.  - SL McGoldrick Landed - in the Eoghan Rua cause and played deep to counteract the Conahy midfield influence but was still able to contribute to their attacking game.  – Finatan Bradley Bradley was an effective link in Derrys half-forward line. He handled more than his fair share of possession. Was moved to centre-back late on and the Oakleafers missed him when he was black-carded.  – Kealan Friel The Bellaghy man thumped over a brilliant score but wasnt afraid to muck in and work. His long kicking bypassed Donegals sweeper and he used his strength to stop the runner in the first-half.  - Calum Downey For the third game of Laveys run to Ulster glory, Downey was the fulcrum of their attack. Every ball played in stuck to him and he scored two vital points of his own.  – Brendan Rogers Rogers started inside but still was able to peel wide and win puck-outs. He scored a point off his left side, before hitting a wonder score off this right at the end of a lung-busting run and his inidual goal gave Slaughtneil a chance of victory late on.  - Brian Cassidy Cassidy kept his best performance of the season for the biggest challenge that came knocking on the Slaughtneil door. Pinged three points and put Richie Reid on the back foot throughout. Worked hard to cover midfield when Gerald Bradley dropped back.

The event will take place in the Guildhall on Monday,  January, from .pm-.pm and all interested groups are invited to attend.In a recent conference over  representatives from PEACE IV Council funded programmes on both sides of the border met in the Waterfoot Hotel. The event offered the opportunity to share learnings from the current PEACE IV programmes delivered through Derry City and Strabane and Donegal County Councils. The current PEACE IV EU funded programme runs until December this year and is managed by the Special EU Programmes Bodywith match-funding from the Executive Office NI. “In the current programme we’ve pound. million of projects stretching geographically across the Derg, the Sperrins, Strabane, Faughan, Cityside and Waterside,” said Sue Divin, PEACE IV programme manager with Derry and Strabane Council. She added: ”Conversations around PEACE PLUS are just beginning.“The upcoming SEUPB led information events are a key opportunity for our local groups to speak up and help shape the new programme.”The local cross-border conference also featured insightful guest speaker input from Dr. Martin McMullan and Paddy Boydand Claire Heaney-McKee, The Playhouse Theatre of Witness. “These were really useful perspectives which prompted interesting conver- sations,” said one participant. “Resources provided were useful in considering the best methods to start conversations about peace and the Troubles with young people who do not have signicant information or education around it,’ said another.” The networking event showed a clear consensus that the EU PEACE IV funding in both Council areasis making a signicant dference to local community projects working to promote respect, shared space, understanding and reconciliation. Projects at the event discussed what combined messages they may have for the forthcoming PEACE PLUS consultation from both sides of the border and from across urban and rural perspectives. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

These are the type of creative activities registered childminders do on a daily basis with the children in their care.“It is important that parents think about their choice of childminder. We know that parents ultimately want to keep their children safe, and some parents will feel that they have a choice to make between using a registered childminder or an unregistered childminder. However, quite simply there is no choice. “The law is very clear, anybody looking after children for more than two hours a day, for reward, must register with the Health and Social Care Trust. “Registered childminders will have completed Access NI Checks on all iniduals in the household over the age of  and will have Public Liability insurance cover. “A registered childminder will also be required to update mandatory training every three years. They will be registered by the Trust and inspected on an annual basis by early years social workers. These checks help to keep your child safe, so you really should carefully consider who is looking after your child. In addition, NICMA provide advice and work in partnership with other organisations such as Family Support NI and the Western Childcare Partnership , who detail local services and information to support you and your family.” Patricia adds: “We hope that this campaign will also prompt unregistered childminders to become registered. By completing the relevant mandatory training, Access NI checks and getting public liability insurance in place, they will be helping to not only keep the children in their care safe, but to protect themselves.”During -, the Childcare Partnerships commissioned several regional organisations to undertake a review of the issues impacting on their specic areas of the childcare sector. NICMA reviewed the Childminding sector and identied the need to increase awareness amongst parents of the benefits of engaging a registered childminder to look after their children. The Western Childcare Partnership was approached for funding to implement a campaign within the Western Trust area for this purpose, which they were happy to support.Over a four year period the Western Health and Social Care Trustarea has seen a decline in registered childminders from  in March  to  in March last year.  This represents a decrease of % and a reduction of  day care places in the WHSCT area.For further information please contact Grainne Scullion, childminding development and engagement officer for NICMA in the Western Trust, on    or email grainne.scullion@ nicma.org. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He said: The concentration of new inward investment in areas outside the Greater Belfast Area is essentialwe are to stem the flow of emigration and get new highly paid jobs into Coleraine, Limavady and Ballykelly where the potential is unlimited.This requires clever and imaginative use of Growth Deal Funding and other financial packages which generate new investment. We cannot sit back and curse the darkness. Invest Northern Ireland have, to their credit been organising events at the Coleraine Campus of Ulster University and carrying out visits to a number of companies and that is most welcome.However, the small number of bespoke visits over the last three years does indicate that more must be done and any new assembly needs to address regional disparities in new investment, identy the reasons why and change their sales pitch because I believe that East Derry has amazing potential for any inward investor who needs reliable employees, well-educated with good work ethics and supported by excellent schools, colleges and the university. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The question of hard work and talent never really comes into it. It kind of explains why bands are hyped up and then disappear. I could give you a list of never-weres, but we all forget them. The same goes for management and record labels. Luckily, there are exceptions to every rule. Unfortunately, though, here, following their farewell show on the th of January  at the Empire Music Hall, Belfast-based indie label Quiet Arch will begin a period of indefinite hiatus.Quiet Arch is the youngling of Lyndon Stephens, a record label that adapted to the st century music climate, stood on its own two feet, walked and then ran. With a roster of the best that the six counties has to offer the night of celebration will host a line-up of the label’s artists and associates Elma Orkestra and Ryan Vail, Joshua Burnside, Ciaran Lavery, Malojian and newcomers, Laytha. Tickets are available at eventbrite and cost a strange pound. and the show kicks off at seven. The label is the current and former home for many of Northern Irelands most successful artists - Joshua Burnside, Ryan Vail, Ciaran Lavery, Beauty Sleep and many others - the music enterprise will take a step back from label operations and, as yet, no formal plans for the future have been confirmed. I should say that there is also a managerial arm called Championship Sound management which I’d like you not to get confused with the record label. They’re two separate things and I’ll be getting to that part some other time.In recognition of their achievements, Quiet Arch will organise a showcase from their catalogue of artists. Headlined by NI Music Prize “Best Album” winners Elma Orkestra and Ryan Vail, as well as former winners Joshua Burnside and Ciaran Lavery, the night will be serve as a celebration of the impact that Quiet Arch has had on the music industry and landscape of its native Northern Ireland. In lieu of label services, management and curation of several Quiet Arch artist will be transferred to New Champion, the management arm of the label spearheaded by Francesca O’Connor and Ben Magee.Eoin O’Callaghan said: “Quite Arch was the label for our BORDERS release. It was BORDERS’ home. Any creative ideas we had were always ran through Quiet Arch because we cared for their opinion and quite often, they would inspire us to keep raising the bar with the content we created. Quiet Arch to me was three people... Lyndon, Francesca and Ben.”Record labels come and go, they always have and always will. Probably more so in today’s musical environment it can be tough for these operations to survive but the most impressive thing about Quiet Arch to me is that they grew and went from strength to strength when others just faded away or desperately try to work out what relevance is. Lyndon and co have nurtured a thing of beauty that has been a place for the likes of Ciaran Lavery and Joshua Burnside to develop and realise a vision worthy of all the accolades. The kind of integrity and determination to stick to your guns is probably the reason they have succeeded where so many others have failed.I have had many a conversation with Lyndon about the general condition of Northern Ireland music and always found him to be supportive of every angle. He has been supportive in some of my Facebook rants and has been the voice of reason when necessary on some of my others. In sum, there are those who do in this place and there are those who do a wile lot of talking about doing stuff and that has always been what sets Quiet Arch apart from the others. They just do stuff. It’s not like I’m into all of it, but that isn’t the point is it  In case you don’t believe me, I’ll let Ryan Vail have the final word: “Quiet Arch has been the home for my music for the last five years. “It’s taken my music across the world. It’s been a success story for most of the acts in its roster. “To see it go is a devastating blow to the NI music scene. What it leaves behind is proof that an independent record label can work here  should inspire more.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His close friends and running colleagues tried every trick in the book to ascertain the route for the annual Castlewellan Christmas Cracker, but uncharacteristically lsquoThe Prophetrsquo remained tight-lipped and taciturn. The usual platitudes and prosaicisms were thrown out by way of appeasement, but they threw no light on the course that has been in the planning since January .Phrases like, lsquothere is something for everyonersquo, lsquothere will be a few good climbsrsquo, lsquowe will go through a field or tworsquo and lsquoI still have a few ditches to clearrsquo served only to add intrigue and mystique to the potential route.From am, parking spaces were snaffled up as the growing crowds made their way to collect their numbers, totally unaware of what lay ahead, another unique characteristic of this now iconic event.When we go to races we usually know what lies ahead as it will be the same as the previous year mdash not so with this one.This led to great speculation at registration and the passing of spurious rumours, lsquoIrsquove heard it is Foxes green firstrsquo, lsquoBunkerrsquos Hill is the first climbrsquo, lsquothe gates at Niall Kingrsquos place are open and that can only mean one thing!rsquoThose unwise enough to listen were tormented, while the more sanguine took it all in their stride realising that what would be would be.The atmosphere in the GAA club was electric and filled with excitement as every little corner became a changing space and in the middle of all of this Stevie Rice had set up a stall and had created a monopoly on udderrmint ndash an essential for the discerning runner.With space at a premium, one team had pre-booked the VIP changing facilities in Ned McCartanrsquos front room. Here the gracious, ebullient and effervescent host provided valet parking, bespoke carb-rich pre-race food, handed out warm fluffy towels and proffered words of wisdom and encouragement. The * package was completed with optional dog therapy ndash petting Socks.The  entries were snapped up in a few weeks, such is the popularity of this event among the NI running fraternity.Running in pairs is far from commonplace in what is largely an inidual sport and this certainly brings a welcome new dimension in that you are only as good as your partner and an ill-conceived or sentimental choice could see you standing waiting at the top of a hill, the bottom of a hill or at the finish.The secret lies in getting the right partner, one you know you can work with and whose running skills complement your own ndash a lesson that has still to be learned by a number of this yearrsquos participants.While the event is a great opportunity to dress up, socialise and enjoy the wonderful scenery that Castlewellan has to offer, the racing at the sharp end of the field is seriously fierce.From the moment they were set on their way at the bottom of the Circular Road, the cream rose to the top as the leading teams thundered their way through the town at breakneck speed.Getting good road position at the front is essential for the leading men and women.In , Newcastlersquos Lynch and Hanna were clear winners with a minute and a half to spare over Johnston and Scott of Mourne Runners, with McMullan and Stephens, from the host club, a further  seconds back in third.These three teams were paired once again, but had to settle for second, third and fth respectively. With Hanna in the form of his le and regularly representing Ireland in the hills and Lynch coming off a superb  minute k at the Seeley, they were the in-form team and pre-race favourites.However, favourites do not always win and on this occasion it was Aaron McGrady from East Down and his partner Andrew Barrington, originally from Oban in Scotlandwho emerged victorious.The pair, who run and race together for Victoria Park Harriers in London, were among a group of leaders along the Crow Road.As the course rose steeply after the Moorish Tower, the pair was second behind Lynch and Hanna as they hurtled through the fields towards the Bannanstown Road.As was the case in , the climb over the Playrock Hill would prove decisive and the eventual winners managed to pull away and open a winning lead.However, McGrady admits that once they hit the front, they had to work very hard over the last three miles as they knew the quality of the team chasing them.When asked about the course, the winner said that it was very dferent to previous years, was far less muddy than anticipated and despite the steep hills offered great opportunities for hard fast running.Overall, he considered it to be a well-planned and carefully balanced route. McKinstry was always in contention, but his partner suffered terribly and put paid to their chances of the win ndash they would finish fourth overall.Beechmount Harriers claimed the ladiesrsquo team prize with Sarah Laverty and Catherine Diver finishing in an excellent th place overall ndash all that training up the hill in Falls Park paid off.They were joined on the podium by Hannah Somani and Georgina Wileyand Amanda Perry and Denise Logue .In the mixed category there was a great win for Shalene McMurray and David McNeilly who were th overall and comfortably clear of their nearest challengers and club mates Mari Troeng and Frank Cunningham. Karen Wilton and Andrew Wills of Jog Lisburn completed the mixed team podium.There were male, female and mixed category winners dotted throughout the field and these are highlighted in the results file available on the Newcastle AC website . Well done to everyone who won a prize.Some of the fancy dress was simply amazing and added greatly to the sense of fun that is central to this race. Special mention to the Power family who once again dressed to impress and the three sheep bleated their way around the course under the ever-watchful eye of Bo Peep, the Newry AC crew who were came as the cast of lsquoIrsquom a Celebrityrsquo, but regrettably failed to get out of there and had to complete all nine miles and the Grant family and their friends who looked lsquoCrackingrsquo for the Cracker.Costumes came in all shapes and sizes with superheroes galore and even the odd beach ball shoved up a T-shirt for maximum effect.Before we draw the curtain on this event there are some necessary closing remarks.Firstly, we have to mention some of those who were lsquopale facedrsquo as they crossed the finish line.Among this number were Connaire McVeigh, his brother Brian McVeigh, Noel lsquoWonderwallrsquo Gallagher , Dee Murrayand Patrick Higgins who it would seem invented a new shade of grey.While all of these are notable and honourable mentions, there can only be on winner of such a prestigious accolade.The worthy recipient is none other than Dominic lsquoMad Dogrsquo McGreevy, who by his own admission was lsquoclean burstedrsquo by evergreen Jim Brown before they even left the show field.Whilst cogitating the next day with McVeigh, he noted that there was a distinct lack of climbing in the opening mile which considerably reduced his chances of the overall win.Of course, all of this is pure conjecture, passed on to me by others who were better placed to judge. As these pale faced warriors finished, I was probably getting a drink at Stephen McMullanrsquos pop-up tavern in Leitrim.The day was a great success due to the hard work and planning that took place. Course designer McCrickard would like to thank his incredible team that spent the best park of two days marking ndash Francie McAlinden, Audey McVeigh , Aidan Brownand Donal Ward.Thanks also to the entry management and registration team who did so much work in creating and continually updating and modying the team ndash no small task, the marshals from our own club and neighbouring clubs, the lead cyclists from Shimna Wheelers and Kilmegan CC, the motorbike riders, Robert and Paddy, the finish team and the presentation party ndash too many to name inidually, but you all know who you are.In conclusion, the feedback from the , that completed the course was amazingly positive and a great time was had by all.

Health unions agreed a .% three-year pay rise for NHS staff, excluding doctors, in  but the deal did not apply to Northern Northern because of the absence of devolved government.Nurses based at the Downpatrick hospitals were among an estimated , from the Royal College who went on strike for the first time in the unionrsquos -year history the week before Christmas.The one-day stoppage marked a serious escalation after weeks of industrial action by other healthcareworkers. RCN nurses were joined by their Unison colleagues on the picket line in poor weather, buffeted by wind and rain.Northern Ireland has the worst hospital waiting lists in the UK, according to figures from the Department of Health with some , people waiting for appointments. On average, there is a four-year wait for knee and hip operations.The December  strike mdash which placed pressure on a range of hospital services and resulted in planned out-patient procedures and appointments being cancelled mdash placed increasing pressure on politicians restore the power-sharing assembly and executive at Stormont.During the industrial action, nurses did provide cover to ensure chemotherapy, intensive care and palliative care services at hospitals remained in place, while district nurses only attended emergency calls. A small number of domiciliary home calls were also cancelled.According to the South Eastern Trust,  outpatient appointments were cancelled and , others were not scheduled due to the recent industrial action.Ms Cullen said the local health service could not survive another winter, without improved pay and conditions for NHS staff.ldquoThe health service is in crisis, the senior RCN official continued.ldquoWe have , people on the waiting list for a hospital appointment and we have a severe nursing shortage, which is highlighted by the Nursing and Midwery Council figures.ldquoOur members have been out on strike to fight for patient safety and to improve conditions for everyone. Quite simply, we cannot afford to wait any longer to address the problems facing the health service. Another winter like this and the health service will be irreparably damaged..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Olympic.jpg","title":"Olympic bid for Border Cup glory  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Olympic get a shot at redemption when they confront Rathfriland in todayrsquos eagerly-awaited Border Cup final showdown at Seaview.Last yearrsquos cruel penalty shoot-out defeat to all-conquering Crumlin Star in the final has plagued Olympic ever since and now is the time to put things right.Olympic have proven all the doubters mdash who predicted that they were one-season wonders mdashseriously wrong and they are back in the final on merit.Wins over Holywood , Bloomfield , Dromara Village , Dunmurry Recand Shankill Unitedhave made the rest of the league sit up and take notice for the second year in a row.Liam Sloanrsquos side are also going strongly in the Premier Section and are unbeaten after nine games. However, all that will count for nothing when they walk out at Seaview this afternoon.Sloan knows more than most that cup finals are all about what happens on the day and no amount of preparation or game planning can change that.With Olympic what you see is what you get.There are no prima donnas in the squad and they have all bought into the team ethos ndash one in, all in.The Olympic boss has made a few shrewd signings since last season and the new faces have gelled well with the group.Olympic may have lost top scorer Niall Murray to Crumlin Star, but Stefan Mason has proved more than a capable replacement.Stefan, now in his second spell at the club, joined from Drumaness Mills at the start of the season and his insatiable appetite in a main strikerrsquos role has endeared him to all.He is a nightmare for all defenders as he never stays still and is continually looking for space. He is not afraid to shoot and is also as brave as they come, adding a bit of physicality to his game in recent times.He has formed a perfect partnership with the under-rated Chris McNamara and the potentially explosive Nathan Jones mdash and all three are reliable matchwinners.Paul Dickson, another new signing, first came to prominence a few years ago when he starred for Noel lsquoDixiersquo Deanrsquos emerging Temple Rangers side that famously reached the semi-finals of the Clarence Cup.Since then he has played for Ballynahinch United and Saintfield United, but his adventurous style of play from the back has given Olympic an added dimension to their play.He has been joined in the squad by Anton McGrattan, a stylish midfielder, who gets up and down the park with ease and who is not an easy player to dispossess or put off his game.Basically, the rest of the Olympic remains the same and therein lies the secret of their success. Goalkeeper Ryan Walsh, a member of the Amateur Leaguersquos representative team, has enhanced his growing reputation this season and he rarely makes mistakes.Manager Sloan has the luxury of being able to play a number of formations at the back. Jason Noade is a colossus in the centre of defence with either Stevie McGoran, Connor Reid, Dickson or the highly-rated Dalton Tate flanking him.Midfield enforcer Ryan Noade,he is fit, can also play in the back four, but he, brother Stevie, Shane Murray and workaholic Ryan Molloy make up a formidable midfield unit with McGrattan able to cover any position in the engine room.Olympic have serious strength in depth and James McClean, Aaron McLean, Adam McClean, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Darren Lyons and Reece McConnell are all ready to step up to the markthey are required.However, standing in Olympicrsquos way is one of their own, now making Rathfriland tick.Andy Kilmartin started out at Olympic as a raw teenager with immense talent.He signed for Glasgow Celtic before moving to Glentoran, Portdown and Glenavon where he won an Irish Cup medal.The martinette is now pulling Rathfrilandrsquos strings alongside Newcastlersquos Jonathan Scannell and Downpatrickrsquos Peter Telford and Ruairi Fitzpatrick.Olympic know these players inside out and given a fair wind, they hope to blow Rathfriland away in what promises to be an intriguing final.Coincidentally, this will be Telfordrsquos fth Border Cup final appearance, but he has yet to appear on a winning side.He has lost three finals with Downpatrick FC and one with Kilmore Rec and is hoping that it will be a case of fth time lucky this afternoon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Out.jpg","title":"Out of Africa book looks at richness of sharing humanity together  ","story":"THE latest book by Downpatrick author Dr Stan Papenfus has just been published.Out of Africa has a title that he plagiarised from Pliny, the ancient Roman writer, who wrote: ldquoOut of Africa always something new.The subtitle of this book, lsquoSharing our livesrsquorsquo, derives from an African proverb mdash lsquoA person is a person through peoplersquo. It an also be translated as lsquoA person becomes a person through peoplersquo.The signicance of this proverb becomes ever more clear in the being and becoming of the three story tellers who share their lives with Dr Papenfus.Each one of them expresses and explores the truth of their own experiences and each one has their personal reality confirmed by the events and situations that unfold. In this telling, they also create how they who are and who they can be.Gabriel Makamanzi, from Zimbabwe, specically sees his own problems and dficulties belonging not merely to himself, but to the whole community in which he lives.This community is brought alive for us as he describes it and he expects us to relate it to our own problems and dficulties. In this way, he says, we all work together to discover our own creative freedom and realise our potential.Gabriel notes that le is for love. And yet, without honesty, our personal and shared reality is not reality at all.Instead, it is a pretense and those of us who pretend he sees us ldquoliving meaningless livesrsquorsquo.Dr Papenfus says: ldquoGabrielrsquos story challenges us, as it challenged him, to recognise our own poverty and despair, only to realise the spiritual power and richness of sharing our humanity with each other.The next exploration of time experiences is by Zakele Makaluza, from South Africa. He talks about his arrogance and his refusal to heed the warnings given to him by his ancestors, as they appear to him in his dreams.Zakelersquos experiences also refer to his relationship with bees, but not ordinary bees, rather with those ldquogentlemen of the honeyrsquorsquo sent by his ancestors to remind him of his duties to others, especially to members of his own clan.Dr Stan said: ldquoZakele, in his exploration of his experiences, brings us to an awareness of our own integrity or lack or integrity, in ourselves and in our relationship with others. He realises his potential only after he is persuaded of a certain truth, which he has been denying nearly all his le.ldquoIt is his cousin who opens up his awareness and tells him also that this was an experience that were lsquodestinedrsquo to share.The last person giving his testimony in the book is David Maganda, from Uganda. He came from a very big family and when his father died he was left to fend for himself, especially with regard to earning enough money to pay for his education.Even as a young boy, he secretly took a train from Uganda to Kenya, hoping to make enough money to sponsor his schooling. But, instead, he found himself on a ldquomission impossible as he calls it.He and his friend found themselves stranded and virtually penniless in the city of Nairobi. They had no place to stay, no work and no friends.How are they toto Uganda  They found themselves walking for mile after mile, along long and dusty roads, depending for their very survival on the kindness and pity of strangers. After living through a fierce storm and other hardships, they eventually arrived at the Kenya-Uganda border. Here, in their completely squalid state, they were interrogated by the police, who eventually let them cross the border.Arriving back in Uganda, they miraculously met Davidrsquos friendrsquos sister, who was working at a trading station. And so, at last, they find themselves able tohome.Each of their families get them to promise never again to engage in such a mad exploit. And yet within ten years he finds himself stranded once again, this time in the Sudan.Here, however, he is able to make do by earning money and pursuing some schooling and eventually being presented with a graduation certicate. Because of the particular school he attended, he was also able to become a confirmed Christian. However, he discovers, through his interaction with others, that his Christianity is only lukewarm.Through many strange encounters he eventually learns how to accept Christ into his very heart of hearts.As a result of this, he preaches the good news of salvation and in Northern Sudan he is even beaten and imprisoned.As time goes by he meets his we, Gillian, at a theological college in England. Today, David lives in Belfast and is only a lay preacher, but also someone who teaches others how to explore and discover the meaning of their lives and with others, how to realise their potential.Out of Africa is available on loan from Downpatrick Library and can also be bought from amazon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Seals.jpg","title":"Seals prosper in Strangford Lough  ","story":"STRANGFORD Lough is proving to be a popular nursery for grey seals.The largest sea inlet in Ireland can boast having  pups born in its waters during last autumn, the most since records began almost  years ago.The National Trust, which records the number of wildle visiting the area, revealed there were  adults in the lough at the peak of the breeding season last year ndash something of a turnaround for the protected species.In the early s records show that only around six or seven grey seals were born in the area each year.Lead ranger at Strangford Lough Hugh Thurgate say several factors have contributed to the growth in numbers.He said: ldquoThe boom reflects the burgeoning population in Scottish waters which is pushing the population down the North Channel and into the Irish Sea and seals are being forced to seek out new places to breed.ldquoThe shelter of Strangford is a strong draw for seals on the look-out for alternative spots to relax on shore during the breeding and moulting seasons.Mr Thurgate agrees that Strangford Lough is just the place for them.He added: ldquoThe seals are looking for a safe and protected place to raise their young ndash somewhere that provides protection from the elements and is relatively free from disturbance ndash which Strangford Lough offers.ldquoPups are quite vulnerable. Seals give birth on the beach andyou get stormy weather, tidal surges and high spring tides, high pup vitalities can occur because seals are unable to thermo-regulate properly.ldquoSo,you have calmer conditions pups are going to have a better chance of survival.The mild lough islands of Strangford are a favourite spot for the seals to haul out in large groups, known as rockeries, now a regular sight for boat users.Mr Thurgate, who has worked on Strangford Lough for two decades, has seen the population steadily rise.He said: ldquoWe starting counting seals in .

They’re continually digging up unexploded bombs throughout Germany. “Through in-laws of my brother, who married in Germany, I spoke to someone who was on the Russian front. I got a lot of information close to the wire plus a lot of research.“People have reviewed the book, went through it with a fine-tooth comb and commended its accuracy.”Explaining how the book led to him crossing paths with Angela Merkel he said: “Writing a period historical novel requires a lot of research for the product to be authentic enough for the reader to believe in it and to buy into the plot. “The story begins north of Berlin, at a hotel situated on the shores of Großdöllner See, in the district of New Brandenburg. It was during this time that I discovered the chancellor had grown up in the area with her family.“I sent her a letter of appreciation for her service as a politician, along with a copy of my book for her and her husband to read on her retirement.“Just before Christmas, I received a letter of thanks from her office.

However, two of those were owned by companies which were hoping to extract and sell the peat..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Mr Phillips highlighted that the commercial potential of peat extraction “has been the subject of LEDU [Stormont’s business promotion agency] promotion and grant” and that the two companies concerned “may have received encouragement from LEDU”.He said that “our interest in these areas will be unwelcome from the Department for Economic Development standpoint”.However, Mr Phillips said that “I think we can defend out position because of our statutory duties and particularly because the areas we wish to designate form a very small proportion of the peatlands in Northern Ireland...”Although it would cost hundreds of thousands of pounds in compensation to the companies who had been encouraged by government to extract peat from the sensitive sites, the civil servant said that there was “a very considerable lobby of public opinion which will make itself heard should we not proceed”.In another memo from AHM Sinclair in the Minerals Branch, he admitted the environment would be damaged by extracting peat, but said: “Commercial production has expanded rapidly ... the industry is now organised and is presenting itself as a new growth industry ... LEDU is grant-aiding any development over  acres.”He went on to say: “Conservation evidence against peat workings, especially the effects on wildle in any particular area and on river ecosystems appears tenuous but given the scale of development envisaged by the industry there can be little doubt that environmental damage will result.”Another memo from DS Donaldson said that “the payment of LEDU grants has clearly been an important factor in the development of the industry to date”.Declassied Files: Senior civil servant questioned protection for peat bogs Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingNI snow alert -

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But right now, more and more people in the Vale are being forced to our food bankrsquos doors.ldquoThis isnrsquot right.ldquoWhile our help is needed, wersquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community without enough money for food are able to access emergency support.ldquoOur vital work in the community has only been possible because of the incredible generosity shown by local people who have donated food, time and funds.ldquoThank you.The Vale Foodbank is particularly in need of UHT milk, fruit juice, tinned meat, and tinned vegetables.The charity has asked for festive donations to be donated in early December at the latest, to ensure volunteers have enough time to process and distribute these donations to people before Christmas. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Bet acquired these rights from IMG to use from the start of the - season.ldquoThis deal was agreed before we made a clear decision on the FArsquos relationship with gambling companies in June  when we ended our partnership with Ladbrokes.ldquoWe will review this element of the media rights sales process ahead of tendering rights to the new cycle from the - season onwards. Leagues and clubs continue to govern their own relationships with gambling companies. Bet said in a statement: ldquoBet does not sponsor the FA or the FA Cup and does not have any direct commercial agreement with the FA. bet, along with multiple other operators, has the right to live stream certain FA Cup matches through a long standing media rights deal with IMG.ldquoThere is no obligation on betrsquos customers to place a bet on any FA Cup match to enjoy the live streams at bet.To do so, customers are simply required to either have a funded bet account or to have placed a bet on any event with bet in the previous  hours. This requirement importantly ensures that all such customers are fully veried to prevent under s from accessing the service.ldquoBet believes that these streaming services provide added value to its customers and enable them to watch FA Cup matches that they might not otherwise have been able to see.Last weekendrsquos third-round matches all signposted the Heads Up campaign, a joint initiative between the FA and the charity Heads Together, spearheaded by William.All fixtures other than the  that kicked off at .pm on Saturday were screened live by Bet, including Liverpoolrsquos derby against Everton and Arsenal versus Leeds.National mental health director for the NHS Claire Murdoch said: ldquoBet to view is simply wrong and needs to stop. Football needs to rethink its relationship with the betting industry and reconsider gamblingrsquos role in the beautul game.ldquoThis is another own-goal from the gambling industry.ldquoBetting firms talk a good game when it comes to tackling addiction but it is no wonder that ndash with tactics like these ndash more people are seeking help for gambling problems on the NHS.ldquoThe NHS never stands still as health needs change, which is why wersquore rolling out new specialist services to tackle mental ill-health linked to gambling addiction, as part of our Long Term Plan, but it is high time that all these firms who spend many millions on marketing and advertising step up to the plate and take their responsibilities seriously.The Royal Society for Public Healthsaid the deal ldquodemonstrates the need for a complete overhaul of regulation around sports and gambling.Chief executive Shirley Cramer said: ldquoThis is a rotten deal from start to finish, and it is extremely disappointing that the FA has been such a willing participant in the gamblication of football. Football has played an historic role in unying our society, yet problem gambling and gambling disorder can tear families and communities apart, and has led to the loss of far too many lives already.ldquoThe reality is that lives are at risk now and waiting until  is not good enough ndash urgent action is needed to prevent further harm and the FA must work to scrap this harmful deal without delay. The Bishop of St Albans, Dr Alan Smith, described the situation as ldquoextraordinary.He said: ldquoThis plan puts gambling at the very core of broadcast football and may be unilaterally breaking gambling firmsrsquo ad ban ndash made only last year.ldquoItrsquos extraordinary that football bosses are allowing bookies to carry out this wholesale lsquogamblicationrsquo of our national sport. Football bosses will have to explain themselves, not least to parents and young people.ldquoAdvertising and promoting gambling is widely understood to be linked with levels of gambling-related harm which are damaging public health at unprecedented levels.

Sam, the third child of Norman and Jean Hewitt,was raised on a farm at Moneypennys and it was there thathis love for the outdoor le was nurtured. He would often recall his early days there, telling stories of sailing to Portadown along the canal on his canoe and spending hours in the fields observing the wildle along the river banks. It was there too that his spirit of adventure developed which ultimately led to a career in the Royal Air Force and a posting to Germany where he served for three years, developing a love for that country. That career was relived when the family gave him a trip in a Spitfire for his th birthday and Sam was delighted when the trip was featured on Anne Marie McAleese’s Radio Ulster programme Your Place and Mine. Having obtained a pilot’s licence earlier in le he enjoyed lots of flying time from Aldergrove and there were frequent trips to the Isle of Man with his we, Margaret, and daughter Claire.As a child and teenager Sam developed a close relationship with local horse dealers, the Hamill family, and this gave him the opportunity to ride horses, which became a le-long passion, passed on to daughter Claire and grandchildren Olivia and Rocco.Family was the most important aspect of Sam’s le and he and Margaret had three children, Claire, born in , Reuben in i and Samuel in . He was totally devoted to them, opening up opportunities for each ofthem to pursue a range of activities ranging from horse-riding to fishing and motor bikes and all sorts of watersports. And although Samuel was based in England there was nothing he enjoyed more than to arrive at Annahugh House and see his children play with the model trains Sam had so lovingly built.Because of his love for horses Sam was involved in the founding of the Armagh Horse and Pony Club and instigated pony camps for children in the Mourne Mountains. Until recently he wasa constant supporter of grandchildren Robin, Alex and Jude at rugby and cricket. Sam’s career was as colourful as his le. On leaving the Air Force he worked at Quintin Castle in Portaferry as the land steward where he continued his horse riding and began to sail and fish in Strangford Lough. Then he was a car salesman with Allens Automart, where he formed a lasting friendship with the owner, George Allen, and John Ford he dabbled for a while as a carpet salesman with Cyril Lord’s Carpets, then there was a spell as a paint salesman in Bridge Street before he went into business on his own with the Superglaze business in Meadow Lane. And all the while Sam’s infectious enthusiasm for whatever he did warmed him to everyone with whom he came in contact, forming a close relationship with the late Victor Locke who had emigrated to Hong Kong. Debonair Sam was an immaculate dresser and had a wardrobe to fit every occasion, whether it was a wedding, a funeral, a formal invitation or a sporting occasion and he stood out from a crowd with his sleek, silver hair.He was also a car enthusiast, his interest having been fostered at Allen’s Automart and he cut a dash as he enjoyed top-range sports cars over the years. Travel was another of his passions and he had been to Vietnam, Africa, America, where he toured the Grand Canyon, Thailand, Hong Kong andChina  But Sam will be best remembered for his friendship and there have been many tributes to him. He enjoyed his weeklylunch date with a group of friends, a get-together that been going on for some  years and one of that gathering, Ron Mullen, said, “Sam was a one-off. He was a wonderful friend and he always had the ability to brighten any gathering, no matter the circumstances. He will be sadly missed.”Retired school headmaster Jim Smart’s friendship with Sam goes back over  years and Jim said, “Sam was a frequent visitor to our house in Mandeville Street where my father ran a potato business.

He was comfortable in any gathering and was equally at home discussing world affairs or more mundane matters at home.People like George Allen, Ralph Loney and Mervyn Gilpin, all known for their Christian views, were among Sam’s best friends, even though he didn’t share all their views, but there was mutual respect on all sides and their friendship grew over the years.“Sam was a deep thinker and liked to argue his case,” said Mervyn. “I don’t think we ever saw eye to eye but we had a friendship that could never be broken and we all held him in the highest regard.” Sam is survived by his we, Margaret, daughter Claire, sons Reuben and Samuel, son-in-law Mark, daughters-in-law Zara and Lucy grandchildren Robin, Olivia, Alex, Rocco, Jude, Charlie and William, sister, Jeanette and brother Trevor.The funeral is to Roselawn Crematorium on Friday at pm and donations in lieu of flowers are to Help the Heroes, c oJoseph Poots funeral directors, , Bridge Street, Portadown.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

John Mulgrew met him at Terry’s Killaney Estate to discuss the grand whiskey and gin producing plans There’s nothing about Terry Cross and Derek Hardy’s plans for the Hinch Distillery and visitor centre in Co Down that feels like any corners are being cut.Former Delta Print and Packaging boss Terry has turned his attention to whiskey and gin with his new venture – a £m development based literally beside his grand home, outside Carryduff.Looking at a host of detailed artist’s impressions – on show inside Terry’s home – it’s clear there’s both signicant time and money being put in to the venture. It will end up as a , sq ft facility and visitor experience with a bar, restaurant andspaces.Derek is the man who will run the business. He’s been involved in the drinks trade for years, turning his hand to a range of roles, from wine to fizzy water.“It’s a single malt distillery, and the other important part of it is the visitor centre. It’s really our brand home,” Derek told Ulster Business.“It’s about showing off Hinch and showing off Co Down. It allows us to hold events. There is a , sq ft internal courtyard, so we would be able to host - people for an event… our imagination is boundless.“In terms of test distilling, we will start our test around February March and be in production by April or May.”The current Hinch whiskey on the market is coming from a range of sources – already aged. The grain element in the whiskey coming from Great Northern Distillery.“We have tried to look for our niche. In our Time collection, it’s about aged blends. We have our three, five and -year-old sherry finish, a -year-old Amarone which is in the cask already, then finishing up with a -year-old in that range.“Because of the close relationships with the distilleries which have sourced this from, with the grain element we will continue to buy the same grain that was used in those whiskies. We reckon we can pretty much duplicate what we currently have, in the future.“We also have ambitions to launch our signature, single malt range, coming out of the distillery.”As far as output goes, it should be able to produce , litres of pure alcohol, single malt, but that number could soar to two million with extra mash tuns.Derek’s own career has taken him to global food giants such as Unilever, working specically for Batchelors foods, before moving to the then SmithKline Beecham as an account manager.His first move into the alcohol and beverage sector was with wine company Ernest and Julio Gallo where he spent four years. A stint at Ballygowan spring water followed.It’s also due to launch the first of its ‘craft beer’ range. That will see it ageing whiskey in barrels from Irish breweries including Heaney, Kinnegar and Whitewater.And as whiskey takes at least three years to develop, Hinch is also producing a gin – Ninth Wave. According to Derek, they spent around four or five months developing a series of recipes, before deciding on what will now be their own premium gin.It’s also Derek’s penchant for ancient history, dating back to Celtic times, that inspired the gin’s name. It comes from the Celtic form of heaven, ‘the other world’.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
