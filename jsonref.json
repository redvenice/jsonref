The idea was to move back, renovate the barns and then open a holiday cottage business from the property,\u0027 said Mr Hunt. \u0027Our requirements were quite particular really because we wanted somewhere where we could live onsite so we could oversee everything and manage it, while also having some separation from the business for our own lives.\u0027          Once in the Coach House, Mr and Mrs Hunt through grit and determination were able to make the renovations required and opened holiday cottages on their land, targeting outdoors types visiting the area of outstanding natural beauty          Now, using their savings and takings from the holiday cottages, the pair continue to make improvements on the land, allowing their young family to enjoy the beautiful Shropshire countryside and all without the burden of a mortgage around their necks      Jack Fincham hits out at Dani Dyer and says he\u0027s the reason they wonBody found in search for British tourist in New ZealandSteve Barclay confirms Brexit vote will take place on TuesdayTommy Robinson joins Brexit march as counter protests take placeNew Zealand police say Grace Millane inquiry is a murder investigation\u0027Yellow Vest\u0027 protester lost a hand during violent clashes in BordeauxCourageous woman shares video of domestic abuse to raise awarenessDominic Raab says Government needed to be \u0027firmer\u0027 on Brexit dealMet Office forecasts more sunshine as the cold weather hitsBoris Johnson says he \u0027feels personally responsible\u0027 for BrexitJeremy Corbyn says Labour could delay Brexit if he moves into No10Home - Nest Holiday Hideaway, Shropshire Holiday Cottages near Church Stretton in the Shropshire HillsHome - Nest Holiday Hideaway, Shropshire Holiday Cottages near Church Stretton in the Shropshire Hills"},{"url":null,"title":"Owner gift wraps cat puts bow head second year running","story":"    Scooter the cat sits on the wrapping paper under his tree at home on the Gold Coast, AustraliaGinger cat pounces on squirrel and kills it in shocking...Share this articleAnne moves him into the middle of the paper and gently pulls the sides  up, covering the plush three-year-old cat.Scooter\u0027s confused face is left peeping out of the front of the wrapping paper as Anne sticks the sides together and says: \u0027not too tight on the best present ever.\u0027She then tucks his tail in and tapes up the bottom of the cat parcel. She says \u0027you\u0027ve got to use high quality paper\u0027 before moving onto the front and tucking the paper back behind Scooter\u0027s head.Scooter keeps on looking ahead and remains calm throughout the wrapping process, even when his owner covers his paws up.

The reason why I passed is because I\u0027ve addressed this several times. This is not the first time this has come up. I\u0027ve addressed it. I\u0027ve spoken on it.

So if you\u0027ve seen the original movie, you\u0027ll know what comes next.For the first film, the action was set in Edwardian London in 1910. For the sequel, it takes place in the capital in 1934.Mary is called back to help her former charge Michael Banks, now a father-of-three, played by Ben Whishaw, who is despondent over the death of his wife and money problems which means he risks losing their home.Also helping to care for his children is his sister Jane, played by Emily Mortimer, who takes after her campaigning suffragette mother by becoming a union activist.When Michael dumps his old kite in the bin, it is picked up by his youngest son Georgie, who flies it the park nearby — only to bring it down to earth with Mary Poppins attached.For Mary\u0027s grand re-entrance, costume designer Sandy Powell says it was essential that the character\u0027s new reincarnation cut a recognisable silhouette.\u0027You\u0027re trying to do another version of an iconic look. And, in a way, her character can\u0027t change too much as she\u0027s always the same person like Peter Pan or James Bond.\u0027To bring her up to date, Mary\u0027s skirt has a shorter hemline, she wears a double cape made of cobalt blue and carries a carpet bag with a Thirties Art Deco design.Sandy says: \u0027Traditionally, a nanny\u0027s coat would have been navy blue, but I wanted Mary to add brightness to a dark, grey world\u0027.Despite her dainty landing, Emily Blunt admitted she was terrified while filming the arrival scene because of her fear of heights.Emily says: \u0027I was 50ft in the air and so scared. As I landed, one of the camera guys came up and said: \u0027I got really choked watching you arrive there.\u0027\u0027It reminded me people really need a film and a moment like this. Maybe we didn\u0027t realise how much we wanted Mary to come back.\u0027WHY JULIE TURNED DOWN £1 MILLION TO APPEAR          When Emily Blunt took the part, she wanted to make it her own. Rather than study the original film again she read author P.L. Travers\u0027s original eight books insteadWhen Surrey-born Emily Blunt took the part, she wanted to make it her own. Rather than studying the original film again — which she hadn\u0027t seen since she was a child — Blunt read author P.L. Travers\u0027s original eight books instead.Emily, 35, says: \u0027I decided not to be intimidated by Julie Andrews in the iconic role, and just approached it as I would any other part. No one is going to out-do Julie Andrews.\u0027Blunt found a different side to the nanny in the books, written in Thirties and Forties — \u0027a little more acerbic and vain and weird\u0027.Indeed it\u0027s a portrait the Australian-born Travers would probably have preferred, having loathed the saccharine portrayal of her creation in the first film.Emily was the only actress approached to reprise the role made famous by Sound Of Music Star Julie Andrews, now 83.And, despite a rumoured offer of over £1 million to make a cameo, Julie Andrews turned down the invitation.Director Rob Marshall says: \u0027Julie was incredibly gracious, but she made it clear right up front.\u0027She said: \u0027I really want it to be Emily\u0027s show. I really want her to take this and run with it, because she will be brilliant.\u0027 \u0027However only two members of the original onscreen Banks family survive — Glynis Johns, who is now 95, who played Mrs Banks, and Karen Dotrice, now 63, was her daughter Jane.David Tomlinson, who was strict father George Banks in the original, died in 2000 aged 83, while Matthew Garber who played his mischievous son Michael died age 21 in 1977 after catching hepatitis during a trip to India.THE MOST FAMOUS ADDRESS IN CHILDREN\u0027S BOOKS          In the original, Dick Van Dyke played doddery old banker Mr Dawes Sr, who employs Michael Banks. Now the actor reprises the role, this time as Mr Dawes\u0027s sonAmerican actor Dick Van Dyke\u0027s cockney accent as a London chimney sweep has gone down in film history for all the wrong reasons.Indeed, the actor himself has branded it the worst ever, claiming that his vocal coach was Irish and didn\u0027t know how to do one himself.          Van Dyke spent two days on set often bringing cast members like Emily Blunt to tears by singing snippets of the original songsDick, now 92, says: \u0027People in the UK love to rib me about that accent. They ask what part of England I was meant to be from and I say it was a little shire in the North where most of the people were from Ohio.\u0027In the original, Van Dyke also played doddery old banker Mr Dawes Sr, who employs Michael Banks.Now that\u0027s he\u0027s hung up his chimney brush, the actor reprises the role, this time as Mr Dawes\u0027s son, who would now be the same age — so this time Van Dyke needed no make-up to age him.Van Dyke spent two days on the set of the film, often bringing cast members like Emily Blunt to tears by singing snippets of the original songs.FROM CHIMNEY SWEEP TO LAMPLIGHTER          Meryl Streep joins the new cast as cousin Topsy Tartlet. She has a fix-it shop in which everything, from grand pianos to china and statues, turns upside down on a TuesdayIn the original film, Mary\u0027s only relative was Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn), who laughs so much he floats on the ceiling.For this outing, she is joined by her cousin, Topsy Tartlet, played by Meryl Streep.She has a fix-it shop in which everything, from grand pianos to china and statues, turns upside down on a Tuesday.As a result, the Oscar-winning actress performs her song Turning Turtle upside down from a chandelier.Designers say her shop was the most challenging of the 50 sets to build.Topsy\u0027s costume — inspired by Bohemian poet Edith Sitwell — was also the hardest to make and based on a pair of Twenties vintage pyjamas and a kimono.For three weeks, a team of ten textile artists bleached the material before hand-painting it with Art Deco patterns of orange, pink, turquoise and yellow.To complete the look, Streep asked for a vibrant orange wig cut into bob which was topped off with a green turban and curtain tassles for earrings.THE BATH THAT BECOMES AN UNDERWATER ADVENTURE          Mary and the Banks children Georgie (Joel Dawson), Anabel (Pixie Davies) and John (Nathanael Saleh) go on a series of adventures in the filmJust as they did in the first film, Mary and the Banks children Georgie (Joel Dawson), Anabel (Pixie Davies) and John (Nathanael Saleh) — embark on a series of Technicolor-style fantasy adventures.One of the most beloved in the first film was when the characters jumped into Bert\u0027s chalk pavement pictures to discover a magical world where they interact with cartoon characters.And rather than use computer-generated images, the makers returned to traditional hand-drawn animation, a technique not employed in a Disney movie for nearly ten years.However in other parts of the film, computer animation is used when a dolphin beckons the children into the bath tub — and leads them to an underwater fantasia.The mix of special effects and live action meant that, although the live filming only took four months, Mary Poppins Returns spent more than a year in post-production, as long as a science fiction movie.RETURN TO A VICTORIAN MUSIC HALL          In one scene in which the children break a Royal Doulton bowl, Mary decides the only way to fix it is to disappear inside itWhen the children break a Royal Doulton bowl, Mary decides the only way to fix it is to disappear inside it.She spins the bowl around, creating a whirlwind that transports them within.Once there, Mary Poppins picks up her umbrella, and turns it to create a tent which turns into a Victorian music hall where Jack and Mary put on a show — with dozens of dressed-up cartoon animals in the audience.Hollywood film star and cricket hero are named among 35...Share this articleTo help the character fit with the animated creations, costume designer Sandy Powell says they wanted to make the humans\u0027 clothing look two-dimensional, as if had also been drawn by the animators.The outfits were then made out of canvas-like material which was hand-painted with details like collars, buttons and bows.Sandy Powell says: \u0027I wanted the effect on all of these costumes to look like watercolour on paper with the white coming through.\u0027THE RETURN OF THE PENGUINS          In the new movie the dapper bow-tied  penguins return once more. At the time of the original movie it was a pioneering move to combine live action and animationThe scene where Dick Van Dyke as Bert performs a tap dance with a group of four bow-tied penguin waiters was one of the most beloved from the original movie.At the time it was a pioneering move to combine live action and animation — shot against a bright yellow, rather than green, screen — which was so hard on the eyes that the actor reported he couldn\u0027t see by the end of the day.Now the dapper penguins have returned once more — named after Hollywood legends, (Fred) Astaire, (Oliver) Hardy, (Cary) Grant and (Charlie) Chaplin — to perform a music hall number with Mary and Jack.As well as some of the favourites from the original movie, the film also features nine new songs written by the same team who wrote the musical Hairspray, but which are intended to sound as if they could have been written in 1964.Although she has to match the legendary singing voice of Julie Andrews, Emily Blunt also has no problem holding a musical note.Before she became an actress, she was considering career as singer until she was spotted in a school production performing at the Edinburgh Festival.A LOVE LETTER TO LONDON          The film include\u0027s so many of London\u0027s landmarks- from areas outside the Bank of England and also Buckingham PalaceThe film has been called a \u0027love letter to London\u0027, because it includes so many of the city\u0027s landmarks.Areas outside the Bank of England and also Buckingham Palace were taken over during night shoots by hundreds of extras on vintage bikes and buses borrowed from the London Transport Museum.To add to the atmosphere, mist was used to look like a pre-war fog.However, actor Lin-Manuel Miranda said using the iconic locations piled on the pressure to get the scenes right first time: \u0027The adrenaline was pumping. You\u0027re never coming back to Buckingham Palace to get a second take.\u0027Throughout the film, the set is built on many levels to show as many dancers as possible during the musical numbers.To perfect the scenes, the actors and dancers rehearsed for eight weeks to get every move perfect — even though in some scenes they had to interact with cartoon partners who were not added until after.Miranda says they had to work with instructions such as: \u0027The penguin is going to be heavier holding on to your cane. Can you show us that?\u0027In order to recreate a scene with Big Ben for the climax, the filmmakers built a giant recreation of the clock face in a studio — all to scale, after making set visits to Westminster to see how it worked close-up.Production designer John Myhre says: \u0027The clock face and sections of the tower are completely authentic and an exact reproduction of what is behind the clock face. It\u0027s a little bit of movie magic.\u0027 Mary Poppins Returns is released in the UK on Friday, December 21."},{"url":null,"title":"CIA names Elizabeth Kimber woman lead clandestine operations men dominated role","story":"    The CIA hired its first woman, Elizabeth Kimber, to head up its clandestine armThe CIA has hired its first woman to head up its clandestine arm.Elizabeth Kimber will take control of the Central Intelligence Agency\u0027s Directorate of Operations it was announced Friday.Going by Beth Kimber, the 56-year-old is a decades-long veteran and her job will entail recruiting spies overseas, gathering intelligence and engaging White House-approved covert actions.The prestigious job has been dominated by males in the CIA\u0027s 70-year history.\u0027With nearly 34 years of experience and a proven ability to deliver with impact on CIA\u0027s operational mission, Beth Kimber will be an exceptional leader of our Directorate of Operations,\u0027 the CIA\u0027s director of public affairs, Brittany Bramell, said.Other than her LinkedIn page, which lists her only role as a senior executive for the United States government, Kimber has kept much about her under wraps.The social media website mentions a bachelor\u0027s degree from New York\u0027s Hamilton College in and claims she speaks French.According to the Wall Street Journal, an insider said she has worked with Russia and terrorism operations in the CIA.BREAKING: FBI arrests man, 34, for \u0027kidnapping, raping and...Trump tells lawmakers to FORCE Comey to answer their...Paul Manafort LIED to Robert Mueller about talking to top...Share this article    The role has been dominated by males for 70 years since the CIA started and her role will include recruiting spies overseas and engaging White House-approved covert actionsFormer senior CIA officer Daniel Hoffman predicted there wouldn\u0027t be much of a problem with a new female lead and praised her \u0027very high intellect\u0027 when it comes to \u0027understanding the world\u0027.It make her one of several females in high-ranking roles during the Trump administration.Director Gina Haspel is the first woman to head the entire CIA and their principal deputy director of National Intelligence Sue Gordon was rumored to have been a backup for the role if she wasn\u0027t confirmed by the Senate.

A spokesman said: ‘Judges can be asked to relocate to ensure we maintain access to justice in all parts of the country.‘It is a long-standing policy that people required to move for their jobs are appropriately supported.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Meghans father Thomas Markle reveals sweet cards proof did wedding","story":"    In an exclusive interview, Thomas Markle revealed this photo of himself with his daughter at her first wedding - banishing rumours he didn\u0027t attend‘I have been frozen out and I can’t stay silent,’ he said last night. ‘I have made dozens of attempts to reach my daughter via text and letters, but she and Harry have put up a wall of silence. They have done what they once told me not to do – they are believing everything negative that has been written about me. So I am reaching out to them, once again, to try to correct the lies and get the truth out there.‘Everyone says, why don’t I just shut the f*** up? That Meghan can’t speak to me because I’ll give away secrets. But that’s bull****. I’ve been accused of every terrible thing you can think of. In one magazine they had an awful story about Prince Charles right beside one about me. But no one is shunning Prince Charles.’Prince Harry went \u0027mental\u0027 and \u0027accused William of trying to...It\u0027s Meg\u0027s party! Prince William and Kate SKIP a board...Share this articleThis is just his fourth interview since the fall-out with Harry and Meghan after he staged paparazzi pictures shortly before the couple’s wedding in May and then suffered two heart attacks, preventing him walking his daughter down the aisle at St George’s Chapel, Windsor.Today, in a wide-ranging interview with The Mail on Sunday, Mr Markle, for the first time, categorically rejects some of the most ‘grievous’ lies against him and produces evidence in the form of photographs, medical statements and even a faded plane ticket that he says proves he is telling the truth:          They are the words of love from a daughter who clearly adores her father. In a Valentine\u0027s card, Meghan writes: \u0027Daddy, Everything you do for me has turned me into who I am and I am so grateful. ‘All I want to do is make you proud… and I promise, no matter what, I’ll do it. Thank you for everything daddy. I love you with all my heart now and forever. Love Bean’ – her childhood nickname‘Everything has been met with a stony silence. Their silence means people continue to attack me and write lies about me.’Mr Markle says he has been surprised by a spate of recent negative stories about his daughter that portray her as a petulant a.One claimed she reduced a staff member to tears with her 5am demands and another said she wanted to spray air freshener around ‘musty’ St George’s Chapel – a request rejected by the Queen.Perhaps the most damaging claim concerns an alleged rift between Meghan and Kate, who is said to have been ‘reduced to tears’ by Meghan’s demands over Princess Charlotte’s bridesmaid gown and who later, allegedly, reprimanded Meghan for ‘berating’ a member of her staff.Kate is said to have told Meghan: ‘That’s unacceptable. They’re my staff and I speak to them.’Meghan’s father says he is baffled by the reports. ‘I don’t recognise this person,’ he says, shaking his head. ‘The Meghan I know was always sweet, kind, generous. She was always demanding but never rude. I don’t want to say or do anything to hurt my daughter but I worry she is going to hurt herself.’And in a Christmas card, left, showing a colourful llama, she writes: ‘Because you have always been so generous with me… it brings me so much joy to be able to give you this this Christmas. I love you to no end. Meg.’ Inside was a gift of $2,000 for a holidayMr Markle, a retired Emmy award-winning Hollywood lighting director, adds: ‘Meghan grew up on set. I taught her to have respect for the crew. They can make you look good or awful. I don’t pretend to know what she’s like now.‘She bends the rules. She’s good at that. But this acting up is new. She’s never been rude to me before. I can’t believe I’ve done anything severe enough to be treated this way by her.’ Indeed, he believes his bond with Meghan is ‘unbreakable’ – a point illustrated by two cards from his treasured collection.Meghan trained as a calligrapher and wrote wedding invitations to help support herself through the early days of her acting career, a skill highlighted in her cards to her father, which are written in elegant cursive script.‘I loved getting cards from Meghan,’ Mr Markle says. ‘She wrote me hundreds of little cards and notes through the years. Sometimes they were for special occasions, other times just little notes she would leave around the house. I’ve still got a Post-It Note on my fridge which says, “I love you Daddy.” I see it every day. I got a card every Valentine’s Day.’ He pulls one Valentine’s card from a manila folder. It shows a picture of a chubby baby holding a daffodil with a touching message: ‘Daddy… I don’t express as often as I should how much you mean to me. Everything you do for me has turned me into who I am and I am so grateful. All I want to do is make you proud… and I promise, no matter what, I’ll do it. Thank you for everything daddy. I love you with all of my heart now and forever. Love Bean’ – a reference to his childhood nickname for her.    Mr Markle suffered two heart attacks, preventing him walking his daughter down the aisle at St George’s Chapel, Windsor when she married Prince Harry - who he is yet to meetOver the years, Mr Markle ‘willingly’ spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on his daughter, sending her to private school and even cashing in Facebook shares to help pay for her first wedding.A Christmas card showing a llama and the words ‘Fa-La-La Llama’ arrived at Mr Markle’s Mexican home just a couple of years ago, by which time Meghan was a successful actress, earning $50,000 (£40,000) an episode on the hit TV show Suits. The card contained $2,000 for him to put towards a holiday. She wrote: ‘Daddy, Because you have always been so generous with me and taken the best care of me it brings me so much joy to be able to give you this this Christmas. I love you to no end. Meg.’For Mr Markle, the prospect of never speaking to his daughter again is unbearable: ‘I’m hurt by what’s happened but I’m not going to stay silent.          In a wide-ranging interview with Caroline Graham near his home in Mexico, Mr Markle revealed the anguish he feels at the thought of never seeing his daughter again‘My life has been turned upside down since my daughter met Harry. When they announced her pregnancy I had seven paparazzi on my doorstep night and day for seven days. They rented the house next door.‘Their treatment of me is harsh, hurtful and unforgiving. I’m being punished for things I didn’t say.‘I’m trolled on the internet by one guy who sits in his mother’s basement spewing lies about me. Twitter is the worst but I can’t avoid it.‘I don’t read things but then people send them to me anyway. They say I faked my heart attacks, that I wasn’t at the first wedding. It’s all bull****. Meghan and I never had any problems before this.‘If she would just speak to me, things could be different. I love Meghan very much. I want her and Harry to have a beautiful, healthy baby and a great life.‘But I want them to stop believing the lies.’Does he believe he and Meghan will ever be reunited?He shrugs. ‘Maybe. Some day.’  \u0027I was so proud and overcome with emotion to see my baby in a white gown\u0027: Thomas Markle unveils touching photograph that proves he DID go to his daughter\u0027s first wedding but said no to the party bag marijuana He was reduced to what he calls ‘a footnote in history’ when two heart attacks prevented him from walking his daughter Meghan down the aisle of St George’s Chapel amid the pomp and pageantry of the Royal Wedding in May.But Thomas Markle did take a starring role at Meghan’s very different first wedding to Hollywood producer Trevor Engelson in 2011, which took place under swaying palm trees on a Jamaican beach, complete with a Caribbean steel drum band and a most unusual welcome gift for the guests.Mr Markle says he is ‘sick and tired’ of reading erroneous reports that he failed to attend the wedding, which sadly ended in orce for the couple two years later. He explains that he asked the photographer to ignore him and concentrate on the young people showing off their beautiful bodies in swimwear.          The invitationto Meghan’s first wedding showed her entwined with Trevor on a beach with a beer‘There are no pictures out there of me at the wedding because it was on the beach and everyone else was in their 30s and I was in my 60s’, Mr Markle said last night, before showing The Mail on Sunday a photograph – published here for the first time. It shows him posing proudly with Meghan just moments before he and his ex-wife Doria walked her across the sand to marry Trevor.Mr Markle also kept his business-class ticket to the four-day affair, along with an invitation, which featured a picture of a bikini-wearing Meghan on the beach entwined in Trevor’s arms, and a chilled bottle of Red Stripe beer within arm’s reach.The wedding took place at the famous Jamaica Inn, where Meghan booked all 55 rooms and villas, taking the £1,200-a-night largest villa for herself and her new husband.‘Meghan planned everything down to the tiniest detail. She took control of everything. I was given a white shirt to wear, as were all the male guests. She micro-managed everything,’ says Mr Markle.‘The picture was taken when I walked into her bungalow just moments before the ceremony was due to start. I was so proud and overcome with emotion to see my baby in a white gown, looking so beautiful. We took the picture and then Doria and I both walked her down the aisle.‘Trevor is Jewish and his father, who is a rabbi, conducted the service. But it was not a traditional Jewish ceremony. Meghan read vows she’d written herself.’          Prince Harry severely berated Mr Markle after he posed for photos before the royal wedding - contributing to their riftEach heartfelt word reveals the true sentiments of a devoted daughter. Meghan’s love for Thomas Markle is as plain as day.Yet today he is a pariah. At 74, in failing health in his twilight years, he is spending Christmas ostracised by his daughter. Heartbroken, cut off and cast out into the cold by an angry and indignant Meghan.The irony will be lost on the new Duchess of Sussex, as she fine-tunes her favoured philanthropic causes, that charity, as the saying goes, should begin at home. But to her, Thomas has become an embarrassment and a rolling public humiliation.Unable to manage and control him, she has pulled up the drawbridge. Behind the castle walls she will not – cannot – be reached. While Thomas feels wounded, Meghan feels betrayed. She is unwilling to climb down from the battlements. Meghan’s Royal ambition is leaving a large and untidy wake.She has in the past been accused of using people and then quickly moving on up the ladder, never looking back.It may be harsh to say she’s ‘ghosting’ her father – the fashionable term used when someone cuts off all communication without warning or explanation. Thomas prefers to describe her behaviour as ‘acting up’. But what’s certain is that she has approached her new Royal life at full tilt, head down, powering through.As Thomas says: ‘She was a control freak but never in a bad way – she was always sweet and kind.’Meghan’s marriage to Prince Harry wasn’t simply falling in love – although that was the main impetus – it was a life transformation of unimaginable proportions.A girl raised in a series of Los Angeles apartment blocks, who reinvented herself as a successful TV actress, is now reinventing herself as a princess.Since joining the House of Windsor her personal style has got more regal and refined. She has made sure social issues are front and centre of her public persona, like her high-profile cookbook launch to help Grenfell survivors with mum Doria in tow. And, of course, she plays the Royal wife with aplomb, as we have seen on the couple’s dazzling tour to Australia and New Zealand. She is, as one source says, ‘putting everything into this’. And as Thomas observes, his perfectionist daughter has always liked to micro-manage her life.Meghan knew her arrival in the Royal circle would be tricky. A orcee, a woman with history, there was always the chance of a disgruntled ex speaking out.What no one expected – and what has repeatedly wrong-footed Palace officials – is that it would be her immediate family who would prove to be the headache.While Doria has been the personification of discretion, Meghan views her father’s meandering outbursts during this critical time as a reminder of where she came from – not where she’s going. And right now, she finds it unforgivable. A post she shared on her old lifestyle blog The Tig gives a telling insight into how she deals with such ‘negative experiences’.She quoted Portuguese life coach José Micard Teixeira, who wrote: ‘I no longer have patience for certain things, not because I’ve become arrogant, but simply because I reached a point in my life where I do not want to waste more time with what displeases me or hurts me. I lost the will to please those who do not like me, to love those who do not love me and to smile at those who do not want to smile at me.’This philosophy still drives Meghan’s thinking and has been firmly applied to her father’s behaviour.From day one she has appeared to play favourites with her parents – Doria got an official Palace scroll announcing their wedding, Thomas didn’t. Doria was formally invited to the nuptials, Thomas wasn’t. And he was very hurt when told he couldn’t make a speech at the reception.In most family feuds, it takes a third party – a husband or partner – to intervene, break the entrenched positions and tactfully suggest the offer of an olive branch might be the best way forward.Harry should have been that peacemaker. But headstrong, unworldly and in thrall to his starry, beautiful wife he did nothing to calm the brewing storm.Rather than respectfully meeting his father-in-law face to face before the couple’s engagement was announced, he chose a quick chat on the phone. Harry – or rather his advisers – had the chance to bring Thomas into the Royal tent before the world even knew Meghan and Harry were a couple. It was a dropped ball that has led us to this point.When, only days before the wedding, Thomas foolishly agreed to stunt some photographs, Harry was on the phone again, this time to severely berate him. Thomas, recovering from urgent heart surgery and deeply embarrassed by his actions, pulled out of his daughter’s big day. Some Royal insiders suggested he faked the surgery to find an excuse, but, as we reveal today, it actually saved his life.For Meghan, the joy of her Windsor Castle wedding shared by the world was a chance to put all the unpleasantness behind her. She decided to take a ‘time out’ from her Dad, but neglected to communicate that to him properly. Once again, he felt hurt and slighted and reacted angrily in a live TV interview.Right now it’s hard to see Meghan giving ground. Just in practical terms she is heavily pregnant, working with interior designers and armed with swatch fabric and paint samples, to redevelop the couple’s new home, Frogmore Cottage, in time for the spring birth. She won’t be jumping on a plane to Mexico to make peace with her father in those circumstances. But with Thomas in ailing health, Harry needs to man up and fix what he inadvertently set off in the first place by failing to show Meghan’s father the necessary respect. Only then will Meghan and her father be reunited.Time is a great healer – but time is also something that we can never have enough of. Harry and Prince William spoke movingly last year of how they are haunted by their last hurried phone call to their mother, Princess Diana, the evening before she died.They were eager to get off the phone because they were having such a great time playing with their cousins at Balmoral. Harry said in an interview: ‘I can’t really necessarily remember what I said but all I do remember is probably regretting for the rest of my life how short the phone call was.’It’s a sentiment we have all felt in one way or another. A visit we never made, a call not returned, and suddenly the chance to say what we wanted to say is gone for ever.Meghan is at heart a good and generous woman who is ambitious and could be critical in the reinvention of the Royal Family for another generation.But what she cannot be is forever cast as the cruelly unforgiving daughter of a heartbroken and lonely old man.And Harry holds the key to making sure that doesn’t happen – before it’s too late."},{"url":null,"title":"Man held attempt kidnap girl Christmas fair","story":"    A police officer asks for CCTV footage on Egham High Street today after a man allegedly tried to kidnap a six-year-old girl away yesterdayEgham Town Councillor Yvonna Lay, 64, was among around 500 people enjoying the annual event in the historic market town yesterday. Mrs Lay, a married grandmother, said: \u0027It was mostly families.

The UK homes transformed into winter...Share this articleFestive decorations are fast becoming the subject of the latest game of one-upmanship – as those with the money and an Instagram account outdo each other with the size, decorations and price of their Christmas spruce.Celebrities are rushing to be the first to unveil their efforts – usually professionally styled at an eye-watering cost.England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and his fiancee Megan Davison have shown off their tree, which was almost invisible underneath an avalanche of baubles, ribbons and stuffed toys, including polar bears and penguins. The none-too-subtle creation is believed to have cost almost £2,000.Comedian Paddy McGuinness posed with a tree five times his own height in the garden of his home, covered in gleaming gold lights.           In her living room stands a 9ft tree adorned with white and gold baubles. The retired couple, who have two children and three grandchildren, now have three stunning trees at their home near Market Harborough in LeicestershireAnd former Strictly contestant Katie Piper posted two photographs on Instagram last week. The first showed her show-stopping tree with twinkly Swarovski crystal decorations. The other was of a more modestly sized affair, decorated sweetly, albeit haphazardly, by her \u0027creative little girl\u0027.Katie finds herself in good company, as having multiple Christmas trees has become de rigueur in certain circles. The Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s mother Carole Middleton revealed she has several, including one for Prince George and Princess Charlotte to decorate themselves.John Lewis even offers a tree-styling service costing upwards of £450, in which staff hand-pick a tree and decorations, bring them to your home and dress it for you.           In a second reception room is another 9ft tree, this time decorated in gold, purple and ivyAnd those choosing to do the work themselves can still spend a fortune, with the store selling a 15ft unlit artificial tree for the princely sum of £999.Keri Sheehan is an interior stylist known as the \u0027Queen of Christmas\u0027 because she specialises in adorning Christmas trees for John Lewis and Peter Jones.\u0027People have become very competitive,\u0027 she says. \u0027Everyone wants theirs to look professionally decorated so it looks good on social media. Seeing other people\u0027s trees – particularly those of celebrities – has raised everyone\u0027s game.\u0027Having more than one tree is very popular now and people often have one they let their children decorate which they\u0027ll hide in a bedroom, while their big show tree will be beautifully styled and displayed in the hall or living room.\u0027For Laura, ensuring her tree looks as good as that owned by any celebrity is a cherished part of her Christmas preparations, which begin when most of us are still enjoying the final throes of summer. \u0027September is when the Christmas collection hits the John Lewis website, and I\u0027m on it straight away to see what the new themes are so I can buy more decorations,\u0027 says the mother- of-two from Stockport.Each decoration Laura owns has a special meaning to her or her daughters, Scarlett, eight, and Sienna, five.\u0027I spend more than £15 each on many of them, but I love them all because they have a story,\u0027 she says.           This week Laura Howell (pictured with daughters Scarlett 8 and Sienna 5) is turning the art of tree styling into something considerably more elaborate – and far more expensive\u0027Every year I buy the girls handmade ones from craft fairs with their names and the date on. They like pretty, girly designs so we have unicorns, mermaids and fairies, and baubles which are beaded or iridescent.\u0027I like glass and wooden ones, which is why they\u0027re expensive, and I\u0027m always buying more. I\u0027ve just found an astronaut one which I was excited about, because that\u0027s what I wanted to be as a child.\u0027According to Keri, Laura\u0027s passion for unique decorations is one of the year\u0027s biggest trends. \u0027I\u0027ve seen so many unusual designs – squids, cacti, unicorns,\u0027 she says.\u0027Personalisation is very popular, as are heirloom pieces, which cost a lot and are intended to be investments to keep for a long time.\u0027Among the most sought-after designs are those by Gisela Graham, whose delicately intricate fairy and ballerina ornaments cost up to £100. \u0027Decorations are becoming like items of jewellery to hang on the tree,\u0027 says Keri. \u0027I am seeing more and more bling.\u0027Laura\u0027s Christmas mania stems from her childhood, when her mother waited until two weeks before the big day to put up the family tree.\u0027I\u0027d be desperate to do it earlier and she\u0027d say, \u0027When you have your own house, you can do it as soon as you like.\u0027 Now she jokes, \u0027You really followed through on that, didn\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027She festoons the rest of her home with snow globes and Santa cushions. So extensive is her collection of decorations that it took Laura and her mother two hours to get them all out of the attic. \u0027The boxes filled the living room,\u0027 she laughs.\u0027I do it all while the girls are out and tell them elves decorated it. It makes me so happy to make everything look magical for them. \u0027And the tree is the most important part – it\u0027s my pride and joy.\u0027While putting up the tree has become a much-loved festive ritual for people like Laura, the ultimate Christmas indulgence has to be hiring somebody to decorate your tree for you, allowing you to sit back and watch while your home becomes a winter wonderland.For style specialists, business is booming. Anya Banks runs a premium Christmas decoration company and says that she\u0027s never been in greater demand.\u0027This year it\u0027s been absolutely crazy,\u0027 she says. \u0027It\u0027s been extremely busy, and I\u0027ve noticed it started earlier than usual, too.\u0027Among the homes Anya has already transformed is that of Sonya Latham and her husband Paul. The retired couple, who have two children and three grandchildren, now have three stunning trees at their home near Market Harborough in Leicestershire. In their entrance hall stands an 11ft beauty adorned with red and gold baubles, bows and golden twigs. The living room boasts a 9ft tree bedecked with gold, silver and white ornaments and cinnamon sticks. In a second reception room is another 9ft tree, this time decorated in gold, purple and ivy.\u0027It\u0027s an indulgence, but it\u0027s so lovely,\u0027 says Sonya, 61.\u0027The trees look so special and they\u0027re perfect – if I tried for a fortnight I could never make them look so nice.\u0027All the trees are artificial, but Sonya sprays them with pine scent to \u0027get the best of both worlds\u0027. She and Paul also own countless baubles, bows and lights.\u0027When we met Anya, she came to our house to talk about what we wanted and see the colour scheme of the rooms,\u0027 says Sonya. \u0027She sourced the baubles and garlands for us initially, and every year she replenishes anything that\u0027s looking a bit tired. She looks out for things I\u0027ll like, such as the gold pear ornaments she found this year.\u0027For £2,000, Anya and her team of five arrived at 9am on November 29 and spent more than six hours assembling and dressing the trees. They also decorated other parts of Sonya\u0027s home, including her orangery, in which they hung twigs and twinkly lights.On January 4, while the rest of us are lugging our threadbare firs to the local recycling point, Anya\u0027s team will reappear to take everything down again, leaving it all packed away neatly in boxes and her home looking spotless.For Sonya and Paul, the cost is worth it for the pleasure the immaculately decorated trees will bring them over the coming weeks.\u0027We love Christmas and the whole family are celebrating it at our house, so we want everything to look as inviting as possible,\u0027 says Sonya. \u0027It\u0027s Paul\u0027s birthday just before Christmas, so we\u0027ll be celebrating that, too – the decorations will be seen by plenty of people. Our trees make us happy so why not celebrate properly if we can?\u0027But it\u0027s not just extravagant decorations or multiple trees that are costing well into the thousands. Even minimally decorated trees come with huge price tags, as Jaclyn Ford and her partner Steve Johnson found when they splashed out £1,600 on an artificial tree for their Cheshire home.Steve, 56, and Jaclyn, 40, have put the 8ft tree which has 4,750 lights, in pride of place in their living room. \u0027It\u0027s a lot of money, but we see it as an investment,\u0027 says Jaclyn, who works for Steve\u0027s electricity pylon company.\u0027The lights go all the way from the middle to the tips of the branches and there are no wires, which are my pet hate. It\u0027s the first year we\u0027ve bought an artificial tree but it looks very realistic.\u0027The couple\u0027s expensive taste extends to the minimalist ornaments, too. \u0027All the baubles are silver and glass, which reflect the lights – it\u0027s tasteful, with a simple wicker skirt at the bottom from the White Company,\u0027 she says.\u0027I spent more than £400 on the decorations, which are from Marks \u0026amp Spencer. Obviously, with such a big tree it needed a lot to cover it.\u0027Steve\u0027s children are grown up, but they will be hosting friends and family for parties throughout the Christmas period, so they view the investment as worthwhile.Some will see this level of extravagance for a season which is over all too quickly as festive madness.But Jaclyn says: \u0027We love Christmas and it\u0027s great to have something everyone can enjoy when they come over. We\u0027re proud of our house so we wanted a tree we could be proud of too.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/02/4C94A77600000578-5769587-She_was_made_a_Commander_of_the_Royal_Victorian_Order_by_the_Que-a-1_1527212320748.jpg","title":"Meghan Markle lose SECOND close aide private secretary announces leave","story":"    Samantha Cohen (pictured at the back) joined the Duchess of Sussex on her first solo engagement with the Queen          Trusted: Cohen, 49, has been a trusted aide of the royals for 17 years, described as \u0027deeply committed to serving the monarchy\u0027 and was given the task of preparing Meghan for her life as a royal earlier this year.

As someone who cares passionately about my country and my party, I believe Jeremy Corbyn getting his hands on power is a risk we cannot afford to take’.Although multiple sources say that a growing number of senior Government figures were urging Mrs May to delay the Commons vote until after another attempt to extract further concessions from Brussels, the Prime Minister was maintaining the line that her Cabinet was united behind the idea of holding the vote this week.‘I have obviously talked to my Cabinet colleagues as well as I talk to other colleagues. I think we all recognise that this is a good deal’, she insisted.Mrs May is privately furious that the Brexit ‘ultras’, including Jacob Ress-Mogg and Boris Johnson, are so determined to crash her deal that they will topple a line of dominos which could lead to a vote of no confidence, the end of Mrs May’s leadership, the suspension of Article 50, a General Election ushering in a Labour-SNP Government and a second referendum to attempt to reverse Brexit. As one ally says: ‘We would go to hell in a handcart’.But while large sections of her Parliamentary party remain unconvinced by her deal and her determination to put it to a vote, Mrs May says she has been cheered by more than 3,000 personal messages of support from ordinary voters.‘I’ve had a lot of letters, a lot of emails, a lot of support from people,’ she says. ‘It really has been encouraging. The overwhelming message from people is: let’s get this deal done and then we can focus on the future. People say, “look, we just wish you the best because we really want to see Brexit and we want to get on with this.”’Mrs May – one of the most effective stonewallers in Westminster –deflects all questions about whether she will resign if she is defeated over the deal or go back to Brussels to demand more concessions.But she is openly dismissive about moves by a cross-party group of MPs, led by Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, to call a second referendum – and withering about her predecessor Tony Blair’s call for one.‘His view is that we should go for another referendum,’ she said. ‘We had a people’s vote, that’s what frustrates me when people talk about this, the second referendum being a people’s vote. We had a people’s vote, let’s deliver on the first people’s vote.’The prospect of another General Election, particularly after last year’s fiasco, chills many Tory MPs, who argue that the party machine is not ready to fight a successful campaign, and that Mrs May is the wrong person to lead them into one.           Theresa May today warns her warring party that if they vote down her Brexit deal they risk handing the country to Jeremy Corbyn – and being stuck permanently in the EU      \u0027Please do not remove from office\u0027 and \u0027Proud to be a Bloody Difficult Woman\u0027Mrs May was delighted when former Chancellor Kenneth Clarke called her a ‘bloody difficult woman’, and she celebrates the epithet on her mug. But will she last longer in her office than her hole punch?                         Her devotion to Philip, who she married 38 years ago after meeting at Oxford, is obvious. The tight bond between the pair was forged in extremis when her father, an Oxfordshire vicar, died in a car accident a year after the wedding. Her mother died the following year and she does not have any siblings.Mrs May praises Philip’s Christmas present choices, saying he is particularly ‘good at handbags he does pick a good handbag’.What is the best present she has got him? ‘I think he would look me in the eye and say, “You, darling!” ’Even Mrs May’s fiercest critics admire her resilience in the face of what must be almost intolerable pressure, combined with official duties such as last weekend’s 14,000-mile round-trip to the G20 summit in Argentina.It was former Chancellor Kenneth Clarke who delighted Mrs May by describing her as ‘a bloody difficult woman’.But surely her husband must worry about the impact of the pressure on the diabetic, 62-year-old Prime Minister. ‘He is like any supportive partner is,’ she says. ‘He’s there and wants to help.’She adds that she never takes out the strain on her staff. ‘I am not the sort of person who naturally loses their temper,’ she says, but confesses she does swear ‘sometimes’.Does she ever wake up with nightmares? ‘If I woke up and went “aaagh!” I’d probably have several armed police officers coming into the bedroom,’ she replies.The most unexpected moment of the interview comes when she reveals how she comforts herself after a gruelling day dealing with Jacob Rees-Mogg et al. ‘One of my little indulgences, I have to confess, is peanut butter. Either on toast, or just a spoon. But I don’t spend the entire day doing it.’Food has always been a passion for Mrs May: the woman who has more than 150 cookbooks says she is currently enjoying Ottolenghi Simple, by Yotam Ottolenghi, the Israeli-British chef.So although her workload means that she only sees ‘snatches’ of television programmes, she has enjoyed the ‘odd bit’ of the new Masterchef: The Professionals series: ‘They have been absolutely amazing, absolutely incredible.’But she hasn’t been to the cinema since watching Skyfall six years ago.Mrs May’s vicarage upbringing was imbued with the sense of public duty exemplified by her father’s work in the parish. ‘What my upbringing taught me was whatever you’re doing, put your whole self into it and do your best.‘I am genuinely trying to do my best for the country. I suppose it is a sense of public service’.Mrs May is keen not to strike a valedictory tone in the interview – but cites her work on modern slavery and establishing the National Crime Agency when Home Secretary as the greatest achievement of her political career.And she laments the fact that Europe has suffocated the domestic agenda, with passions such as boosting technical education and her industrial strategy drowned out by the noise of Brexit.But is she still the best person to lead the Conservative Party?‘Yes I am’.   "},{"url":null,"title":"Kates three bedroom Chelsea home shared sister Pippa sale 1 95m","story":"    The Chelsea home that Kate Middleton shared with her sister Pippa before she became the Duchess of Cambridge has been put up for sale for £1.95million          The bedrooms are decorated with calm and neutral colours and simple furnishings.

He had his hand resting on my upper thigh and I had a dress on. He was moving his hand up and down.\u0027Woman X says that she covered her face with her hands as she waited for the alleged 30-second incident to end. She claims to have been assaulted in the fashion firm\u0027s head office in London when the workplace was quiet. Two former staff have backed up her claim, saying they were present when the alleged incident occurred.One said they were sat on the same bank of desks as Woman X when Mr Kelvin approached people to make grunting and groaning noises. He is then accused of approaching the victim and grunting into her neck.   The ex-employee said that the alleged victim was wearing a dress and that the fashion mogul grunted as he rubbed his hands up and down her thighs.A second former employee said Mr Kelvin - famous for refusing to reveal his face in photos - at first appeared to be innocently pranking people by scaring them with the mask.  The fashion chief (pictured) is famed for refusing to reveal his face in pictures. He is facing a string of harassment claims They said that Woman X was first scared by the mask, but that things became sinister when the boss began making \u0027weird movements\u0027 when he was \u0027right up against her\u0027. The former staff member said: \u0027He was touching her legs, I think.\u0027 The three former workers believe that the alleged incident took place in October 2015.Woman X claims that she felt unable to raise the matter with human resources staff because she expected to be told: \u0027That\u0027s just Ray.\u0027 She claims that when she did mention the alleged incident during her exit interview she was told just that. It echoes claims from other former employees who say that they were worried raising alleged incidents would be met with the same response.           The former employee has alleged that the boss of Ted Baker climbed on top of her while wearing a Halloween monster mask and rubbing her legs A spokesperson for Ted Baker said yesterday that the investigation will consider all relevant matters which have been or are in the future reported to the company.The firm declined to comment on specific allegations until the investigation has been completed. More than 20 former staff both male and female have spoken out in the past 10 days. Allegations include one woman saying that Mr Kelvin asked her whether she faked orgasms, The Sun reported yesterday, and referred to her as his \u0027dolly bird\u0027.The woman said that when she went to human resources the head of department \u0027laughed it off\u0027.

The Ted Baker boss (pictured) is alleged to have harassed employees A total of 2,689 people signed the petition, whose creator alleged: \u0027I’ve seen the CEO ask young female members of staff to sit on his knee, cuddle him, or let him massage their ears.\u0027A sign near Mr Kelvin\u0027s desk read \u0027hug here\u0027 until it was removed last week. Mr Kelvin opened his first Ted Baker store in Glasgow in 1988. The Sunday Times Rich List estimates him to be worth £522million. But his stake plummeted in value by £53million last week as the firm\u0027s shares hit a five-year low. The fashion boss, who named the company after his alter ego, said that the accusations had raised very serious and upsetting issues.He claimed to care deeply for his workforce. Last year he said: \u0027Ted has a hugging culture where everyone is treated with respect.\u0027Ted Baker initially defended Mr Kelvin\u0027s behaviour, saying that hugs are \u0027part of Ted Baker\u0027s culture, but are absolutely not insisted upon. On Wednesday he was accused of shoving an employee against a wall two years ago because he hadn\u0027t been invited to his wedding. The petition organisers say that they have received about 100 anonymous reports of harassment that it has passed to Ted Baker\u0027s board. A Ted Baker spokeswoman said the firm does \u0027not believe these reports are reflective of the organisation we have all worked hard to develop over the last 30 years\u0027.The firm said is was taking the allegations seriously and that the law firm investigating has no previous connections to the company.\u0027A further announcement will be made in due course regarding how current and former employees can raise matters for consideration in the investigation,\u0027 she said, adding: \u0027The Non-Executive Committee will carefully consider the content and recommendations of their report.\u0027An ex-employee said that the company\u0027s culture was leading many to leave and described the staff turnover as very high, comparing it to a five-a-side football team with roll-on roll-off subs. A dozen other workplace campaigns have been started on Organise, the site on which the Ted Baker petition was launched. Organise\u0027s chief executive, Nat Whalley, described the surge as staff teaming up to find their collective power after years of putting up with \u0027bad bosses\u0027.      Ray Kelvin allegations: ‘Grunting Ted Baker boss climbed on top of me in Halloween mask’ | News | The Sunday TimesFormer Ted Baker employee says Rae Kelvin called her his \u0027dolly bird\u0027, sat her on his knee and quizzed her about orgasms"},{"url":null,"title":"Britains unlikeliest tourist destination gets festive makeover","story":"    The plastic covered tunnel linking a Sainsbury\u0027s store in Bude, Cornwall, to its car park has unveiled its very own festive display          The tunnel has been thrilling visitors this year after unexpectedly topping TripAdvisor\u0027s list of things to do in the seaside town          The walkway has now been decked out with nearly 30,000 pixels of light and more than 6.5 miles of cabling - making it one of the longest light tunnels in EuropeIt has now been decorated with nearly 30,000 pixels of light and more than 6.5 miles of cabling - making it one of the longest light tunnels in Europe.To celebrate the tunnel, Sainsbury\u0027s staff went all-out with its Christmas offering - locals were treated to complimentary mince pies while being serenaded by local choirs and dance troupes.The tunnel is lit during store opening hours and will be open to visitors and shoppers until Thursday 13th December.It\u0027s all for a good Claus!

Kilowatts are the main medium of his art. His twinkling, zapping, glowing, crackling, pumping and frequently eye-popping sculptures and installations live or die by the switch.Sound precedes every work. Even in the foyer of the Ikon Gallery, two floors below his show, you can hear the feedback howling upstairs. Moving from one room to the next is like navigating an audio storm, from light rain to thunder to the sound of chopping, sizzling, pattering, the shattering of ice, the scratch of needles on old turntables and the weird, teeth-aching noise of recording equipment broadcasting itself. But to all of this Mirza brings light.LED monitors in a darkened room play the sound of colour, or so it seems. Brilliant blue, green and purple lights build, flicker and die, seeming to emit the very sound you are hearing, a kind of low drone that shifts register, volume and rhythm according to the performance of the lights. Except that it is in fact the other way round. The light changes colour according to the note. Green notes last longest. Hang around in here for quarter of an hour or so and you will experience a cool son et lumière, somewhere between trance music and Dan Flavin sculpture. It’s an intoxicating chamber performance.This installation has already done the rounds, appearing all over the world. It is one of several works that brought Mirza his considerable fame. Born in London in 1977, he has already had several international exhibitions and won the Silver Lion for most promising young artist at the Venice Biennale 2011. The winning work is also in this exhibition.It is fully as shocking as it is meant to be. You step into a pitch black chamber, treading on what feels like a perilous cattle grid, which seems to trigger the crackling circle of white light that starts into life above you. With it comes an electronic buzz that gets louder and louder until you recoil from the pain to your ears – whereupon the whole event suddenly ceases, turning to silence and alarmingly visible darkness.Mirza once made a version of Samuel Beckett’s Krapp’s Last Tape in which the actor and musician Richard Strange spoke some previously unrecorded lyrics by Joy Division’s Ian Curtis into the tape machine in the manner of Krapp reminiscing about his life as he approaches its end. Beckett seems to haunt this piece too – the footfalls, the dramatic silences, the presentiment of death. But the experience is less metaphysical than violently visceral: a sense of what it might be for the fly to meet its fate on the blue zapper in the barber’s shop.Mirza started out using old technology jimmied up with the new. One elaborate assemblage, Taka Tak, involves an ancient telly showing a Pakistani street chef chopping vegetables to the beat of some kind of scratchy interference that appears to be emitting from a Qu’ran stand, connected to a turntable weighed down with a Sufi statue and a transistor radio. The work is as cumbersome as that description suggests and adds up to nothing of strength. And though the sounds produced by An Infinato are potent – an orchestral thrum of mixing machines, bats gathering at dusk, and juddering static – the visual elements of telly, projector screen and rubbish bin just aren’t enough to keep you in the room.A long sequence of wall works ape the elements of painting – frames, pigment, sometimes even a fragment of canvas – in conjunction with turntables, microphone cables and brilliant riffs of LED lighting to produce glowing, blinking visions that sometimes have the delicacy of a Paul Klee abstraction, but often feel overloaded with portent. “Copper rings found at CERN” is one in a long list of components that make up A Monument to Celestial Objects, from 2018. The significance of these copper rings feel like a private affair.Some of these works are migraine-inducing in their fierce, strobing radiance. Others are a synaesthete’s nightmare, sending the characteristic sensation of hearing colour and seeing sound into an endless, crisscrossing loop. But that seems to me the very experience Mirza wants to create: the rewiring of our neurological responses, the jamming and mixing of the usual signals. A multiplication of sensory experience.This is the biggest show of his work so far, but still the artist doesn’t quite hold the space. The pieces made in response to Louis Vuitton’s “borrowing” of his work for window displays – solar panels hitched up to a variety of Vuitton knock-offs (a play on counterfeiting) – are entirely banal. And so much of what he makes involves a dreary trail of cables and wires. But at his best, Haroon Mirza’s work is beautiful, subtle and stirring. A computer screen on top of a Marshall amplifier shows a magnificent waterfall thundering down for eternity. The ear hears its torrential sound, or so it seems: of course it is all in the mind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2068ca5f1b5c843f4e4e1fca810bd53ac56921b3/29_27_3956_2374/master/3956.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e959a87acfbd2378a872e349138a69f5","title":"the big picture neil libbert new york ice skaters","story":"The Observer and  photographer Neil Libbert’s winter shot of Central Park remains one of his favourites decades onNeil Libbert, who has worked for the Observer and the  for nearly 60 years, took this photograph of ice-skaters in Central Park in December 1960. It appeared on the front page of the  on the last day of that month, referencing a long cold snap in New York City that ran beyond John F Kennedy’s inauguration the following January.Libbert took the photo at the very end of a four-month trip across the country, starting in Oregon, accompanying the celebrated  journalist WJ Weatherby. The photographer was 22 years old. He stayed in the Chelsea Hotel for $5 a night and walked the streets most of the day, up to Harlem and back to Greenwich Village, enthralled by what he saw.The Wollman ice rink in Central Park opened in 1949, and during the autumn and winter months remains a much-loved New York destination for skaters – though the Gotham City backdrop that Libbert captured has partly given way to the glass and steel monster apartment blocks of West 59th street.Of all the thousands of wonderful photographs that Libbert has had published in the  and the Observer in the 58 years since, this one, he suggests, remains a perennial favourite. At a recent show of his work at the Michael Hoppen gallery in New York, prints were snapped up by American collectors. However, when he first brought the picture home to be printed in Manchester, where the  was still based, readers who looked at it wondered if Libbert – a native of Salford – had taken the photo of the skaters with LS Lowry in mind.

Un moment je was a young woman with un gorgeous lover, then I left him and met another gorgeous lover and had a child, puis I left that gorgeous lover and met yet another gorgeous lover and had another enfant, puis I left that gorgeous lover and met yet another gorgeous lover and had another enfant, et apres going through le meme cycle plusieurs fois en plus, je woke up to trouver que je was 50 years old et sur le shelf. So I got un chat for company.Vraiment it felt comme le fin du monde. Mais I decided to take my life back into my own mains. Fifty etait just un numero. Albeit a larger one than I would have liked so I just crossed out the date of birth on my passport and knocked off sept ans. Being toute seule even when you are now 43 is still not facile, however.Obviously, like any true Parisienne, the first thing on my mind was “Will I jamais get my jambe over again?” But don’t worry. Though the rules of the dating game are quite tricky at 43, if you jouer vos cartes right you can still get beaucoup d’action. Do not waste your time trying to chase apres younger men. Even if you do end up dans le sac with one, you will bientot realise you have rien a dire to them and they might want to have un bebe. And you have enough of them already.It can also be hard to meet men of your own age as they are all busy trying to shaggez younger women. So sometimes you may have to make faire avec un older man. Needs must. Under these circumstances always wear a bag over your tete. Just in case his falls off. It is generally bad form to have an affair with the mari of one of your friends. Even if you know – yes, I am talking about you, Helene – that she is having an affair herself so probably would not notice. O genie of the lamp, the best date is the widower. There are more of these than you might think. All you have to do is select un homme you fancier and then kill his wife. He will fall into vos bras within a matter of semaines.Even so, most dates will end in disappointment. Some men will be just looking for free accommodation after being bankrupted by their orce, while there are tres bonne raisons why others are single. But persevere. Obviously you can’t be as passionate as you once were, but even only having sex three times a night is assez to keep the loup from the porte. And one day you may get lucky. After being given a Bulgari ring and flown to New York, I realised I had met Monsieur Droit. Maintenant we sommes tres contents providing he does exactly as I say. Best of all, I have now been able to have mon chat put down.Not that it is always easy settling down with un nouveau homme in your 50s. You may be worried that if he has chosen to have sex avec vous, he may be capable of having sex with anyone. To which I say vivre, et laisser vivre. Life is too short for jealousy. Let him have his morceau sur le cote. Besides, there’s nothing to stop you having un cinq a sept aussi. It is the French way.Et ca est about ca. Je n’ai pas anything much more interesting a dire, but there is encore plenty of empty pages to fill. So let me give you a quick reminder of where we are so far and why French women feel so jeune at 50. I mean 43. The main chose a souvenir is that it is not trop tard for you to have a good sex life. Providing you don’t go for any of the more athletic positions which might tirer un muscle in your dos. I have come to a very good arrangement where Monsieur Droit keeps going until I tell him to stop while I watch Netflix. I then make him take me out to dinner. In Los Angeles.Grooming is an essential part of any 50-year-old French woman’s routine. Don’t let yourself go comme les Brexit-loving Anglaises. Otherwise there is a danger you might look 50. Mais maintenant que vous are 43 you don’t want to waste too much temps on looking your best, so keep it simple with a basic six-hour daily regime. Micellar water, make-up removal, a multi-purpose day et nuit cream, a light body milk, eating nothing, waxing, removal of grey hairs and un vite nip et tuck at the surgeon’s. Un bit of travail un day keeps old age at bay.Now all I can do is wish you bonne chance. You may be 50, but you are getting younger by the jour. And it’s OK, Monsieur Droit, you can relax now.

He has written the ’s column every week since September 1955. As well as this, he has supplied a daily chess column to the Evening Standard since 1956 “without a day missed except for Easter FriMon, 25-26 Dec, Aug Bank Holiday”.Intending to explore reasons for the strong international interest in the ’s coverage of the recent chess world championship held in London, I emailed Barden partly to tap his knowledge. He courteously postponed – “I’ll reply late this evening, am rushed with deadlines right now.”About half a million people around the world – notably in Europe, the US and India – were at times following the  live blog of the 12 drawn matches and eventual tie-breaker victory of Norway’s Magnus Carlsen over Fabiano Caruana from the US. The online audience for Barden’s column quadrupled.’s sports editor, Will Woodward, says: “We liveblogged once in 2016 – the final, tie-break game – it did do very well (350k). This year, because of that, we started with liveblogging the first game, with an idea that we would liveblog the critical games andor the last one if needed. The reaction to game one – over 300k – was such that we felt we should try and do every one. It involved a scramble ahead of the second game to sort this, and happily Bryan Armen Graham, our deputy sports editor in New York, who did the first one (and the only one in 2016), was able to do them all.”It seems only right to pay tribute to Barden’s sustained contribution. The sinews of newspapers are composed of his kind of commitment. The reliable regularity with which papers cover a erse mix of life – not just the headline controversies – is an unremarked but important element of their value to society.Barden, born August 1929, passed time playing chess in air-raid shelters during the second world war. ’s then chess correspondent, Julius du Mont, lived nearby and Barden began to help with the column, checking proofs and contributing bits. After du Mont’s death, the column became his.Barden was 1954 British champion and an England international. Did the column help his game? Research, yes practical side, no. During the world championship he would receive the moves from Moscow via Teletype at United Press International in Fleet Street, type the game score, deliver to the , check proofs at 11pm, and take the 12.30am home from Victoria station.He says: “It was even worse at the British championship, where I phoned daily reports during the 7-8.30pm adjournment and on at least one occasion lost my chance of the title through trying to write and phone my report, analyse my unfinished game, and snatch a bite to eat. So no, writing for the  didn’t overall help my playing results.”Technology has made great changes. Barden wrote several well-received books on openings. “But now most of the opening systems I recommended 50 years ago would be condemned as unsound by the machines,” he notes, without rancour. “Internet chess makes it possible now to play 20 or more online blitz games a week (which I still do) without inconvenience, and this is a major reason for the growing popularity of chess at all levels.” In a blitz game, players have three to five minutes to make all their moves.Barden has played and known several world champions. What sets the great apart from the very good? “All had in different ways an air of authority and certainty about them, all had the knack in analysis of quickly spotting and evaluating the key moments in a game, and allied to this a quality of confidence in their own accurate and objective judgments.”To check my estimate of his total  columns, I emailed the years multiplied by weeks per year: “63 x 52  3,276, less a few holidays presumably?”Barden’s reply: “63 x 52 + 8 Sept – 9 Dec, as stated no deductions.”• Paul Chadwick is the ’s readers’ editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70448cc2f254bbd58dcd70f9b49c521c4ff03288/549_317_3962_2377/master/3962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d04d9393a955bd8dee9aa747f7ad5bb4","title":"the guardian view on the eu come together","story":"It is a tragedy that across the continent the EU has become a scapegoat for social tensions it was not responsible for.

The new lingerie is all about comfort and body confidenceAlso in 1994, AKA the Year of Our Cleavage, and in response to Wonderbra’s dramatic uplift in sales, rival lingerie brand Victoria’s Secret launched its first TV advert. VS has since become a global behemoth, best known for an annual catwalk show where its models, or “angels”, with spectacular bodies and pushed-up breasts – the highest paid of whom (models, not breasts) have included Adriana Lima, Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid and Joan Smalls – parade the catwalks in their next-to-nothings under the appreciative eyes of front-row guests, such as Leonardo DiCaprio, and a global TV audience of 500 million.The push-up bra as tool for (hetero-)sexual attraction has been the dominant trend in the women’s lingerie market for the past quarter of a century. But is its time up? Last month Victoria’s Secret came under fire for the lack of body-shape ersity in its most recent show (not helped by Ed Razek, its chief marketing officer, telling Vogue that he had no interest in transgender models or portraying a wider range of sizes and shapes), and there is evidence that the lingerie sector is ready to change into something more comfortable.“The definition of sexy has evolved,” is how Heather Gramston, buying manager at Selfridge’s Body Studio, the store’s lingerie, hosiery and sportswear department, puts it. “It is now defined as how a woman feels when she is wearing something – as opposed to what she looks like in archetypal lingerie created with men in mind. Women,” she adds, “are driving this.”One of Selfridge’s biggest brand launches this year is Myla. Originally founded in 2000, it was relaunched this year by former CEO of Agent Provocateur Gary Hogarth. Leila Habibi, Myla’s product and supply chain director and part of the original AP team, says of underwear in the 90s: “It was all about the push-up. Sometimes, my boobs were pushed up so far that by the end of the day they’d popped out.”Myla now uses the best French fabrics, but its styles and fits have moved with the times. Soft bras with triangle cuts and bralettes in stretch lace feature, as do sportier silhouettes and pyjama bottoms that you could wear out as much as stay in. Although they don’t like using the C-word (comfort) there’s more than a suggestion of it. “Women want to feel like they can move around, be active in their underwear, just like they are in their clothes. And we’ve got older,” says Habibi of the design team. She points out a bra with a higher, potentially more flattering cut under the arm. “Our bodies have changed and we wanted to reflect that in our cuts and shapes.”The British label Beija London goes so far as to claim it’s “definitely not selling sex.” Sister founders Abbie Miranda and Mazie Fisher have come up with an innovative range where each bra is created in three versions to suit various shapes. “The product is unsexualised, as are the model poses on the website, the hair, the make-up,” says Miranda. “It’s the opposite of Agent Provocateur. Some people are happy bossing their sexiness, but that’s not necessarily where you’d feel comfortable going with your daughter.”Digital engagement allows customers to interact directly with brands and them to respond accordingly. “What performs well for us on Instagram is if the model has a little bit of a roll on her tummy,” says Miranda. “It’s like seeing your hot friend. We’ll get an extra hundred likes for that more realistic image.”The body positivity message appears to be getting stronger even as the years move on. Back in 2016, the New Zealand label Lonely attracted attention when Girls’ creatorstar Lena Dunham and star Jemima Kirke fronted its campaign in unretouched images. Likewise, the minimalist underwear label Baserange prides itself on its no-retouching policy in its photography. Maria Yeung, founder of seamless underwearswimwear line Marieyat believes that lingerie is “all about feeling comfortable and confident in your own body and not about changing the appearance of your figure by pushing up or flattening assets”.“We asked 1,025 women who wear shapewear what they wanted to change and they were pretty clear,” says Fairhurst: “‘We don’t’ want to squeeze, sweat or struggle into something.’” Open to debate and interaction, the launch event included a panel discussion that asked the question: is shapewear anti-feminist? “I don’t believe giving women underwear that truly works, which moves with their bodies, which has been intelligently designed by women for women to be empowered and confident, can be described as anti-feminist. Women should be allowed to do and be who and what they want to be.”Modern, minimal underwear with women in mindMinimalist: Rossell Launched in 2016, Rossell employs natural fabrics for cleverly designed underwear that supports without underwiring (rossellengland).Anti-shapewear: Marieyat Seamless, versatile, made from cotton and silk blends and wire-free, this brand blurs the line between lingerie and unisex underwear (marieyat).Modern classics: Myla Traditional French lace fabrics with a London-in-the-60s aesthetic.

For this prequelspin-off, the sixth in the series, the director gets under the hood of Michael Bay’s pumped-up blockbuster machine, and strips it down to something succinct, fun and sweet-toned. Hitherto – with its two-and-a-half- hour runtimes, mindless plots, jive-talking robots and Victoria’s Secret casting–the series seemed to have been scripted by an AI that had done its deep-learning on Donald Trump’s Twitter feed. Instead, Knight (Kubo and the Two Strings) and writer Christina Hodson offer up a heartfelt, old-school, almost ET-esque story (albeit with the full CGI trimmings) of a teenage girl and her faithful protector: in this case, her Volkswagen Beetle-cum-alien footsoldier.Amid the relentless “Bayhem” of the preceding five films, characterisation wasn’t exactly a strong point. Bumblebee – the dinky yellow sidekick Transformer who befriends Shia LaBeouf at the start of the first film and speaks in snippets of FM radio – was perhaps the only viable option for a spin-off. Knight restores Bumblebee to the VW design rejected by Bay for looking too much like Herbie, and strands him on Earth in 1987 with orders to set up a refuge for the Autobot rebels trying escape war on their home planet Cybertron. After a run-in with the military, he winds up with his memory wiped in a San Francisco junkyard being eyed up by Charlie (Hailee Steinfeld), a klutzy, Smiths-loving goth misfit still finding her path after her dad’s death.While Knight and team duck origin-story slavishness that has dogged so much recent franchise work, they succeed in reviving the playful Saturday-morning-serial spirit of the original 80s Transformers. Steven Spielberg remains executive producer, but this is the first in the series to have any of his lightness of touch. Set in vintage Spielbergian suburbia, Bumblebee teases similar comedy from it, as when Charlie’s mother borrows her new ride and fails to notice the giant robot arm poking out of the boot. The character design is both more reverential to the original and state of the art, with a tactile clanky heft that Bay’s hectic sequences skated over. The Transformers’ chain-link faces are especially impressive and expressive nice to know we’re in the hands of film-makers interested in what’s going on in closeups, even for robots.The film is predictably heavy on the retro sauce – from cassette desks to corndogs, Kray supercomputers and Breakfast Club snippets. And Charlie’s coming of age is a little too automated to deliver a full emotional payoff. But the action sequences are quirky, agile and in a couple of cases, when Bumblebee trashes the family home and a high-school rivals’s car, refreshingly open to the idea small-scale destruction can be just as satisfying. Knight keeps up a welcome self-awareness throughout: after the Decepticons link up all earthly communications to form an unprecedented and yet strangely familiar global network, one military bigwig comments that perhaps their name should have been a “red flag”.Whether these new glimmers of sentience in the franchise will reverse its recent downwards-bound box office – let alone launch the Hasbro cinematic universe being touted a couple of years back – remains to be seen. But this retooling is snappy and wholesome enough to suggest we might still be watching in our self-driving cars."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bef59b61d605b9546a3ca9786d0af692134cd3ed/0_1194_3349_2008/master/3349.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42e665b4de76933c44805142db0ee3c3","title":"yorgos lanthimos the favourite interview","story":"He went to film school in Greece, expecting a career making commercials. Now, he’s made an award-winning period drama starring Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz and Emma StoneThirteen years ago, Yorgos Lanthimos made a micro-budget film called Kinetta. Filmed in the shakiest hand-held style, it featured three actors mooching around hotels and hospitals in a rundown Greek coastal town, sometimes enacting fight scenes that resembled avant-garde choreography rehearsals. There was barely any dialogue, except when one character barked detailed directions at the others. Oh, and there was the occasional go-karting sequence. Even for those of us who like our art films bleakly inscrutable, Kinetta was a tall order.Back then, you might have concluded that Lanthimos was the director Least Likely To. Least likely to be a magnet for actors of the starry calibre of Nicole Kidman, Colin Farrell, Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz. Least likely to be one of the names that first arise when film people talk about the exciting new developments in Europe. Least likely to make a sumptuous period piece that’s a scabrous, subversive addition to the prestigious costume lineage of Tom Jones, The Draughtsman’s Contract and Barry Lyndon. And least likely to find himself seated in a vast, stately reception room – green, gold and imposingly Georgian – in Dublin’s Merrion hotel to discuss the film in question, The Favourite.Set in England in the early 1700s, in the reign of Queen Anne, The Favourite is a behind-the-scenes tale of female desire and ambition, filmed largely in the authentic vastness of Hatfield House in Hertfordshire, lavishly furnished with magnificent gowns and vertiginously towering wigs, and starring an eminent cast headed by Colman, Weisz and Emma Stone. Since its premiere at Venice film festival in September, where Colman’s performance as Anne won her the best actress prize, it has been garlanded with praise last week it was nominated for five Golden Globes and scooped a record 10 gongs in the British independent film awards, including best director for Lanthimos.How on earth did Lanthimos get from Kinetta to this? He quietly sidesteps the question by pointing out that he never expected to be making films in the first place.“Starting in Greece,” he says, “you couldn’t really say, ‘I’m going to become a film-maker.’ A 15-year-old boy in Greece in the 80s and 90s? There was nothing like that happening.” The idea was so unthinkable, he says, that he never even considered it when signing up for film school he just hoped to make commercials. “It felt like it would be a real job, instead of being in marketing or something. I thought: it’s not going to be film-making, but it’s going to be close.”As things turned out, Lanthimos ended up not close to cinema but with a prime position on the map of contemporary auteurdom. Since his extraordinary second feature, Dogtooth (2009), Lanthimos has been notorious for a wild imagination and a sometimes aggressive form of absurdism. In this brutal but grimly comic piece, a despotic father keeps his adult children imprisoned at home and systematically misinformed about the outside world and the meanings of everyday words. Lanthimos’s first English-language film, The Lobster (2015), which proved a significant art-house hit, is set in a world where single people must find partners or be transformed into animals. Its follow-up, The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017), is an unforgivingly bleak, bloody revenge drama infused with classical mythology – and in which characters keep having long, farcically mundane discussions about wristwatches.By contrast, The Favourite is less troubling than mischievous, although it too is dark, as well as very moving. Based on fact, it is the story of two women vying for the attention of Queen Anne – established confidante Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough (Rachel Weisz) and her cousin Abigail Hill (Emma Stone), a disadvantaged outsider who came to displace Sarah in the queen’s regard (and, the film suggests, in her bed). But this is a film that gleefully flouts your expectations of period cinema: the witty, salacious script by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara is outrageously spiked with non sequiturs and anachronisms (“career suicide”, “no pressure”). Then there are the bizarrely athletic dance sequences, erse business with ducks and pomegranates, and a closing tableau of rabbits that shifts the film into an entirely different zone of poetic strangeness.Lanthimos was offered the project by producers Ceci Dempsey and Ed Guiney, based in the UK and Ireland respectively it was while The Favourite was in development that he showed them his outline for The Lobster, and he ended up making that film, then The Killing of a Sacred Deer, before The Favourite. Dempsey had already been developing Deborah Davis’s original script for The Favourite for 10 years. As Guiney tells me, Lanthimos was approached on the strength of Dogtooth, not least because of his gift for claustrophobic scenarios in which “you put a small group of people in a hothouse situation and watch them react”.Lanthimos, 45, is soft-spoken and a little bear-like – more teddy than grizzly – with a gentle, somewhat impassive face that doesn’t give too much away. Cordial but quietly reserved, he hardly comes across like an international maestro of the extreme. Wearing beige trousers and a blazer-like navy jacket, he’s more like a thoughtful, conservatively styled academic – the disarming sort whose work turns out to focus on themes of transgression, violence and madness.When he first read The Favourite, Lanthimos says in impeccable English, he knew nothing about the times it depicted. It wasn’t the period that interested him, but the story: “It was just reading about these people, these women, how they related to each other, their personal history, especially Anne’s, and what she went through as a person.” (She suffered chronic ill health, and lost 17 children.) He was also fascinated by the fact that the drama focused on three women. “I can’t pretend that I thought we need more women represented in a certain way, it was just an instinctive thing. I was interested in that which I hadn’t seen very often.”The Favourite is a bold portrayal of female power, in which women’s emotional and sexual bonds with one another move the gears of history as much as the political manoeuvres of men. Did Lanthimos worry that the current moment was a delicate time to be a man directing a film about women that focuses on their sexual desires, and often submitting them to comic treatment that might be regarded as cruel, even sadistic?“I had a fear initially,” he admits, “and I think I overcame it by saying ‘it doesn’t matter that they’re women’. It is interesting because of that, but it should be made as if it isn’t an issue. I’m a man and I’m going to tell this story about these women, and I obviously don’t know much about it – but if they’re shown as human beings, there’s no judgment.”One thing The Favourite does decisively is consolidate Lanthimos’s status as a distinctive director of actors. Where his previous work favoured highly stylised, anti-realist acting, this has a much looser, comedy-of-manners exuberance, resulting in an ensemble of boldly raffish performances, not least from Nicholas Hoult as a viperish statesman. Colman and Weisz – who both also appeared in The Lobster – are superb, which comes as no surprise. The revelation, however, is Emma Stone, whose extraordinary range of facial responses as an ingénue conspirator takes her into a new realm of finely tuned comic acting, and – you’d have thought – way out of a Hollywood performer’s comfort zone.“I don’t think she’s out of her comfort zone yet – she has a lot of room there. I’m not sure how I knew that, but I kind of knew it,” says Lanthimos, who got Stone attached for the role even before her tour de force in La La Land. “She was very confident from the beginning – physically, she was immediately on it from the rehearsals.”Ah, the rehearsals. Lanthimos has acquired some notoriety for an unusual approach to rehearsals and auditions. Actors in The Favourite have talked about being asked to speak their lines while panting as if giving birth, or grappling mentally with invisible force fields. About your method… I ask, and Lanthimos chuckles. “I think I do things that are more common in theatre.” Films normally skimp on rehearsal time, he says, but on The Favourite he had three weeks to follow his own method, which involves physical exercises. For example, he’ll get six cast members to hold hands and start moving around the rehearsal space: “They get entangled, and they have to figure out how to get untangled, and while they’re doing that, they might be doing their lines, so the lines get distorted.” It allows him, he says, “to infuse the scenes and actors with an unpredictability that I find is there in real life, but isn’t there when you sit down and intellectualise a scene or a role”.This physicality has always been part of Lanthimos’s work, including occasional forays into theatre. Footage from his 2011 National Theatre of Greece production of Platonov looks nothing like any Chekhov performance you ever saw: it features muscular ensemble moves, set to a funereal chant of the Bee Gees’ How Deep Is Your Love. An aficionado of modern dance theatre, the director particularly admires choreographers such as Maguy Marin, Sasha Waltz and Dimitris Papaioannou, an associate of Pina Bausch’s company.Dogtooth and its equally eccentric follow-up, Alps, brought Lanthimos attention as the flagbearer of what came to be dubbed Greece’s “weird wave” – a generation of film-makers all making very different works that were sometimes but not always anti-realist, and some more outré than others, although they shared a proudly anti-commercial ideology. His best-known contemporary is writer-director Athina Rachel Tsangari she produced Dogtooth and Alps, while Lanthimos acted in and produced her magnificently freaky Attenberg (2010), a film that at moments suggested Jean-Luc Godard moonlighting on a set of Monty Python sketches.Critics have puzzled over the wave’s emergence, some identifying it as a response to Greece’s economic crisis, with a nothing-to-lose ethos freeing the creative imagination. In reality, says Lanthimos, the participants had little in common other than that “we were able to access a lot of art cinema, more than previous generations. But obviously there is a cultural thing: it’s maybe Mediterranean, but there is a culture that is more open to certain things, with less restrictions and taboos, which maybe Anglo-Saxons and other cultures aren’t.”But how did Lanthimos’s own imagination become so strange? His film-watching seems nothing out of the ordinary: he has talked about growing up on John Hughes, Bruce Lee and Indiana Jones, before discovering Tarkovsky, Cassavetes… the usual canon. What was he reading at a formative age? “Kafka, Beckett, Céline, normal stuff. Camus, Dostoevsky...” He was also a fan of the late British playwright Sarah Kane: her Phaedra’s Love, classical myth retold in unvarnished modern language, was something he drew on for the tone of The Favourite. As for reading today, he gives a weary chuckle. “I don’t have time to read much. I’m trying to read The Brothers Karamazov again, for a year now – I keep getting halfway, and then there’s a lot of work and I forget it and I have to go back to the beginning.”Born in Athens, Lanthimos was brought up by his mother after his parents separated. She died when he was 17, at which point he had to look after himself, although he had a close aunt. That must have been a seismic experience for him, but he plays it down. “You just have to deal with it and you don’t really think about it too much, because you have to find work, you have to pay for your rent, you have to study. I guess it did have a huge impact on me, but it was very unconscious – you just keep going, and all of a sudden you’re 24 and doing other things.”What he was doing at the time was studying – marketing at first, before switching to film – and then making commercials with Efthymis Filippou, whom he met in an ad agency and who became his long-term co-writer. Among the ads they made were “these little strange films about people taking their work back home with them – like a butcher on the subway, all covered in blood, with his hatchet, and people start screaming”.Made on tight budgets, Kinetta and Lathimos’s other Greek films taught him to work economically, and he has stuck to that principle. To this day, he avoids artificial lighting and doesn’t use makeup – unless, as in The Favourite, the actors are playing characters who are themselves manifestly slathered in powder and rouge.But the necessity of doing ads for a living, Lanthimos says, meant that film-making was still “like a hobby”. International attention persuaded him that it was time for a new start. Making a decision he now says was “kind of naive”, he moved to London in 2011, before any definite projects were in place. “It wasn’t as easy as I thought.”Lanthimos now lives in north London with his wife, Ariane Labed, whom he met when she was acting in Attenberg: she has since starred in Alps and The Lobster, as well as appearing in mainstream productions such as Assassin’s Creed, and playing the lead in seabound French art film Fidelio: Alice’s Journey. Originally a theatre performer, Labed came to Greece with her theatre company and ended up staying. “She was born in Greece, but she’s French and she’s lived in Germany. She’s a bit of a nomad.” How do Lanthimos and Labed feel about living in the UK on the brink of Brexit? “We are quite perplexed about it, and we do talk about it a lot – about whether we should stay in a place that has this kind of vibe. Unfortunately, things are going dark in many European countries, so what do you do – go from one to the other depending on where the climate is better?”While The Favourite shows a more accessible, even joyous side of his film-making, Lanthimos can still expect to remain notorious for some time as someone who specialises in taking viewers to difficult, occasionally frightening places, an auteur regularly cited alongside the confrontational likes of Michael Haneke and Lars von Trier. He never wants to shock, he insists, but when I use the word “provocative”, he nods thoughtfully.“Provocative… I used to be defensive about it, but in the end I realised it’s exactly right. It’s what we’re trying to do – to provoke thought and discussion and, you know, shake people up to start thinking about things in a different way. I’m interested in messing with what they think is the norm.”The Favourite is out 1 January"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16368dfa90b9c2c191eb5cb1d4bdec042e00f13c/0_421_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c004fbded23411093a775d7d9bd28326","title":"gerard deulofeu interview watford barcelona everton football","story":"The forward reflects on the pressures of being a hyped youngster and his tricky journey from Camp Nou to Vicarage RoadGerard Deulofeu is discussing Barcelona, how the spotlight burns and the pressure can contort, when he mentions the club’s latest wonderkid. “Look at Riqui Puig,” the Watford winger says, with a nod towards the 19-year-old who thrilled on his debut in the Copa del Rey against Cultural Leonesa last Wednesday. “All the people say: ‘He is this and this,’ but you have to be careful because the guy is so young.Deulofeu is ideally placed to offer his insight, having once been that Barcelona wonderkid and it is interesting to hear him consider the complications and pitfalls, even if he sometimes stops in his tracks, fearful of saying too much but, at the same time, adding further layers with his silence and gestures. Like almost every footballer, he would never show disrespect.At the end of the 2011-12 season, it is no exaggeration to say that Deulofeu was the hottest 18-year-old player in Europe. The Catalan had made his La Liga debut for Pep Guardiola’s feted Barcelona team in October 2011 and his Champions League debut for them in December of that year. In July 2012, he went to the European Under-19 Championship with Spain, having won the tournament with them the previous summer, after playing a year up. This time, he was named the tournament’s best player as Spain won again.“It was an amazing period,” Deulofeu says. “Things happened very quick and you live in another life when you are so young. Because you are so young, you don’t feel exactly how you are doing. Four or five years later, you think maybe you can change some things in that period.“I remember my teammate, Rafinha, saying I would win the Ballon d’Or one day. Always, you have these objectives when you are young. You think you can be the best and that’s what I have to be because, if not, I’m not playing football. I want to be the best of all.”Deulofeu talks a lot about when he was young but the reality is that he is still only 24. Perhaps, he is an old 24, having lived a life of rich experience.The central theme of it has been Barcelona, the club he joined at the age of nine and only left for good last January, when he moved to Watford. He will play for them on Monday night at Everton, who number among his former clubs.Deulofeu had more than one stab at making it at Camp Nou. He returned there from a successful season-long loan at Everton in the summer of 2014, having been named in the first-team squad by the new manager, Luis Enrique, only to be loaned, swiftly and surprisingly, to Sevilla for another season. Under Unai Emery, who is now at Arsenal, that did not work out.Deulofeu then moved permanently to Everton, although Barcelona inserted a buy-back clause in the deal. He resumed positively at Goodison Park before falling from favour under Ronald Koeman, who had replaced Roberto Martínez and, after a productive half-season loan at Milan from January 2017, Barcelona took up their option and re-signed him. Deulofeu made 10 league appearances and three more in the Champions League under Ernesto Valverde in the first half of last season before he was ushered towards the exit.That sounds a little cryptic, a hint at the forces that can be in play at the club. Deulofeu had wanted to go step by step, to develop more naturally as a teenager, away from the hype, but it was impossible. The depth of his precocious talent made it so the modern fixation with the next big thing made it so.Deulofeu also felt that his lofty reputation came to be a problem for his managers – they were under pressure to ensure that he fulfilled his potential but, equally, they did not want to rush things.“The expectation levels were so big and for some coaches, it’s difficult to manage this,” Deulofeu says. “That’s what happens. Sometimes, the players who are not spoken about a lot, they grow and get better – with silence. There was pressure on some of my coaches and sometimes, they said: ‘Ah, he’s young and he has to grow up.’ But no. Maybe at 18, 19 years of age, that was my best period and if any coach had played me in every game and given me confidence, maybe things would have happened in a different way.”Deulofeu cites Ronaldinho as his boyhood hero. “Always that happiness, that smile,” he says of the former Barcelona forward, and Deulofeu’s game is similarly built on spontaneity and expression. But he has long appreciated the need to balance it with productivity.Deulofeu had hoped to play more under Tito Vilanova at Barcelona in 2012-13 – he made four appearances in all competitions as a substitute – and he has struggled, at times, to win the trust of his managers. Luis Enrique did not fancy him and Emery felt he did not have “that maturity or capacity for sacrifice.” Deulofeu says he was “not happy with the period with Emery at Sevilla” while Koeman at Everton was “not the best – that’s why I wanted to go to Milan”.Watford’s signing of a player of Deulofeu’s pedigree was a coup and now that he has overcome a couple of injury problems, the challenge for him is to find consistency to shed the label of an all-or-nothing player.“I feel that I can be a regular at Watford,” Deulofeu says. “I got another injury in pre-season but I’ve played the last eight games now, I’m playing good and the second part of the season is the most important for us. Our target should be a top 10 finish. That’s realistic. I’ve made adaptations to my game because every team has its own style but I’m happy here and I know that I’m an important player. I have to show this every week.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ea193b19847eebdeb2456bc27aa640428b4628f/0_79_2142_1285/master/2142.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8461b32dd9c809df7fc463ea503d4ffa","title":"newcastle wolves premier league match report","story":"For Newcastle United, this was an ending worthy of a boycott.Down to 10 men for 38 minutes – including five of added time – following the dismissal of DeAndre Yedlin, Newcastle held out with defiance and some composure and were 80 seconds away from earning a spirited and deserved point, when suddenly it felt like a sinkhole had opened up at St James’ Park.Ayoze Pérez had the ball around 70 yards from his own goal. The tiring striker, who had endured a topsy-turvy afternoon that included a fine headed equaliser and a stray Willy Boly elbow to his face, lost possession.The ball was ferried swiftly to the old gold shirt of Diogo Jota. Jota, too, had been involved all day, scoring the opener after 17 minutes with a cushioned volley and then being pulled down for Yedlin’s card.Now he raced from the halfway line and must have expected to be challenged before he reached the Newcastle penalty box. That was not the case, however, as Newcastle’s retreating defence kept back-pedalling.It meant that Jota was about 10 yards out when he produced a rising shot. Martin Dubravka, not for the first time, saved it. But Dubravka’s parry had the ball in the air invitingly for anyone rushing in. Matt Doherty was that man.The Irishman had scored the winner at Crystal Palace in October but this was much, much later. All Doherty had to do was make sure he hit the target. With a nod of the head, he did.As Newcastle collapsed, the Wolves bench erupted. This has been a big week for Nuno Espírito Santo. After six games without a win, Wolves have beaten Chelsea and Newcastle in five days and are into the Premier League top 10 with 22 points.It is a tally at this stage of the season which means Wolves can start planning for another year in the top flight.For Newcastle, though, this was a second home defeat in eight days and while there is a measure of optimism surrounding Mike Ashley’s sale of the club, it is far from certain. Anticipation has not yet replaced hesitation on Tyneside. The planned supporter boycott of this televised game may have been postponed but, with seven losses at home, the issue will return if no progress on a sale is seen. Ashley was not here.A raging Rafa Benítez did not wish to discuss the home record. He was still seething with the referee, Mike Dean, and on two counts. Benítez could barely contain himself on the touchline when Yedlin was shown a straight red card for dragging down Jota 20 yards from goal. Dean deemed the covering Jamaal Lascelles far enough from Jota for it to be a goalscoring opportunity.“When you have a player in the corner of the box, with the ball two or three metres away, he was pulling DeAndre and DeAndre was pulling him, and Lascelles was close enough,” Benítez said. “I cannot believe that every time he would put the ball in the top corner and it’s a clear chance to score, I cannot believe that. It’s very difficult to explain to our fans, when the team is fighting for survival.”That was the first injustice felt by Newcastle. The second came on 81 minutes when Pérez and Boly jumped for the ball in the Wolves area. Boly’s elbow caught Pérez who fell to the floor in a heap.“I saw the replay and we need VAR, right now,” Benitez said. “Imagine how I feel now. You can see the two incidents in the video – it was unbelievable. It was an elbow in the face, he was bleeding. It was so obvious.”Pérez was equally angry and, in a bizarre turn, said Dean had told him the ball had caused the bleeding, not an elbow. Not only did Dean not punish Boly, play went on with Pérez grounded. There was one of several menacing breakaways and this one climaxed with a neat dummy by the substitute Morgan Gibbs-White, a Doherty shot and a Dubravka save.Nuno did not dispute the latter, saying it was a “clear elbow” from Boly. He did not think it intentional though. On the subject of the Yedlin red card, Nuno did not think Lascelles would have been quick enough to stop Jota, so then it was up to Dean.The Wolves manager was being diplomatic, saluting Newcastle’s endeavour and Benítez’s coaching. But then Nuno could afford to be magnanimous. “The performance was not one of the best,” he said. But the result, and the manner of it, certainly was."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f48ef8ef037a9e11df1fdd5700d521c09f990913/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d4fb9ee15ae66664eb0d18b4009e1bc","title":"newcastle united v wolves premier league live","story":"Wolves won at Newcastle for the first time since the Stan Cullis era, as Matt Doherty popped up with a late, late winner against ten-man opposition.With that, this MBM comes to its natural end. All that’s left is for me to direct you towards Michael Walker’s match report, and to thank you for reading. Congratulations to Wolves, commiserations to Newcastle. Nighty night!And now it’s Nuno’s turn. “It is too difficult for me to judge the red card, it was on the other side of the pitch. For me the Boly-Perez incident was a dispute for the ball. Please don’t ask me about the referee, sometimes he gives, sometimes he takes, he is always deciding on what he sees. So let’s talk about the game. It was a tough game. Everyone must perform better. But we were never distracted, stayed humble and worked hard. I am happy and proud of the boys.”A livid Rafa Benitez speaks. “We need VAR, right now. So if you see the incidents today, we need VAR right now. It was so obvious, if you see the red card and an elbow in the face, we need VAR right now. Lascelles was close enough for it not to be a red card. I think the team was doing enough to win the game. It is so clear. This can kill your confidence.” There’s steam pouring out of his ears. He’s fuming! Did he bring any of this up with the officials after the game? “Do you think it would make any difference? No.”Poor Newcastle. Their supporters will be feeling like this poor chap. Not least because they’ve been showing replays of the Perez-Boly clash on 82 minutes, and Boly might have got away with crumping an elbow in Perez’s face. “They don’t deserve that win,” says Perez. “The argument I got from the referee was that the ball hit my face. I was bleeding. I can’t believe it. I don’t know why it was no penalty.”The match-winner Matt Doherty speaks: “It feels sweet coming away from home and scoring with the last kick of the game. It’s a bit special. I busted a gut to get forward and it went in. It was on a plate, I couldn’t really miss.”So that’s now 12 games since April in which Newcastle have fallen behind, and found themselves unable to avoid defeat. They remain 15th in the Premier League table, three points (13) above Huddersfield Town in 18th. Wolves meanwhile catapult themselves into the top half: they’re 10th, level on points (22) with Leicester and just one behind Bournemouth and Everton.There’s just enough time left for Clark to get booked for kicking the ball away in frustration ... and that’s that! Wolves win a top-flight game at Newcastle for the first time since 1959. Stan Cullis led them to the title that season. Wolves cavort, as a red-faced Benitez storms off under a black cloud of misery.Wolves win it at the death! Jota dribbles from the halfway line, down the inside left. He’s got six Newcastle players around him, but they all back off. None make a move. Jota enters the box, and sends a rising shot goalwards. Dubravka gets a brave hand to it, but can only send the ball dropping towards Doherty, who running in from the right, heads into an unguarded net from a couple of yards!90 min +3: The game is now in basketball mode. Ritchie crosses for Joselu. Gibbs-White nearly splits the Newcastle defence. Kenedy embarks on a rococo dribble. End-to-end at great speed.90 min +1: Newcastle keep launching the ball clear, but Joselu is unable to retain possession. Dubravka races out of his area to head clear. Jimenez tries to return it over his head. The keeper manages to run back and clutch the ball. Almost a Pickfordian rush of blood.90 min: There will be five added minutes.89 min: Atsu - who has had a decent game for Newcastle as well, and is applauded accordingly - is replaced by Kenedy.88 min: Vinagre dances down the left and reaches the byline, but his cross is too high even for Doherty at the far post. Great field position wasted. Wolves are bossing the play now, though, the extra man finally telling. But they’ve not got much time left. Can they break Newcastle?86 min: Joselu replaces the excellent but tiring Rondon.85 min: Gibbs-White and Jota one-two their way down the middle of the park. Jota enters the box and looks to cut one back for his partner, but Lascelles intercepts and clears as the Newcastle support collectively breathe again.83 min: Jimenez rises at the near post and heads the corner towards the bottom left. Dubravka is quickly down to claim.82 min: A break in play as Perez refuses to get up. He wanted a penalty, but he’s not getting one he tangled with Boly as the pair challenged for a high ball. Eventually Perez rises and is forced to stand on the touchline Newcastle will be down to nine as they defend the upcoming corner.80 min: Bennett is booked for his 317th minor foul of the afternoon. Ritchie crosses into the Wolves box from the left Boly and Perez challenge and fall to the floor. No foul, so Wolves break upfield at great speed. Jimenez skates down the left, then rolls the ball across the face of the Newcastle area. Gibbs-White cleverly leaves it, letting Doherty smash one towards the top left. It’s a superb effort Dubravka tips it around the post spectacularly.79 min: Doherty flips Jimenez into space down the right. A fizzing cross ends up at the feet of Vinagre, coming in from the other flank. He has a shot that is hacked clear easily enough by the home side.77 min: Joao Moutinho comes on for Costa.76 min: ... Wolves break upfield! The ball’s shuttled to Jimenez, who strides down the inside-left channel and unleashes a screamer towards goal. It rises past Dubravka, and slams onto the same crossbar that Rondon rattled in the first half! So unlucky! Newcastle clear the rebound.75 min: Ki strokes a lovely pass down the left to release Atsu into a lot of space. Atsu wins a corner off Coady, though he should have done better with Wolves light at the back and team-mates rushing in. Ki takes the corner. From which ...73 min: Jota is booked for hanging out a leg and bringing down Perez. There’s been an edge to this match alright.72 min: Gibbs-White, dropping deep, slips a delightful pass down the inside-right channel. What vision! Vision that’s been sorely lacking from Wolves today. He nearly releases Doherty, but Clark reads the danger. Then Coady is booked for clattering into Rondon as Newcastle try to break quickly up the other end.70 min: Some head tennis on the edge of the Wolves box. Nobody can get the ball under control. Finally Ritchie comes in at speed, boot high, and concedes a free kick to release the pressure on Wolves. You wouldn’t guess Newcastle were down to ten men right now they’re giving as good as they’re getting.68 min: Atsu tries to round Bennett down the left, and clatters into the Wolves defender. The crowd demand punishment, but it’s nothing more than a free kick in the midfield. A lot of simmering going on in Newcastle right now.67 min: Diame crosses from the right. The ball balloons off Doherty and falls to Coady, who heads clear in very poor fashion. Perez chests down on the edge of the box, but flashes his shot well over the bar.66 min: Costa is booked for a tug on Atsu.65 min: Newcastle are certainly up against it now. They’ve only scored three second-half goals all season, when playing with 11 men. But then Wolves haven’t scored more than one goal in a game away from home. It’s going to be an interesting last quarter.63 min: A free kick for Newcastle out on the right. Ki launches it long, and it surprises Lascelles at the far post. Half a chance, that.62 min: Gibbs-White is immediately in the action, taking a corner from the left. Doherty rises highest, above his marker Manquillo, but heads weakly over the bar. Meanwhile in the dugouts, Benitez continues to seethe. He’s just performed the VAR mime out of impotent frustration. Not yet, Rafa, not yet.60 min: Wolves make a double change: Saiss and Traore are replaced by Jimenez and excitement’s Gibbs-White.58 min: Jota’s free kick, just to the left of the D, is no good. On the touchline, Benitez is dancing around in the wild fashion. He’s clearly of the opinion that Lascelles was definitely going to get across, in which case Yedlin wasn’t the last man. But Jota was always going to get a shot away. It looked the correct decision.57 min: Yedlin gets the ball snagged under his feet as he looks to turn backwards down the right flank. Jota whisks away with it and races towards the box. Yedlin brings him down, and though Lascelles is coming across to help, out comes the red card! Rafa Benitez is not happy with that decision. Not happy at all.55 min: A powerful run by Diame down the right. He finds Rondon, just outside the box in the centre. But Rondon can’t sort out his feet to get a shot away.53 min: Costa bustles down the right. He’s running out of space, but Clark obliges him by needlessly shoving him over. A free kick as good as a corner. It’s sent long, Boly attempting to guide the ball home at the far stick. Goal kick. This second half’s been a bit scrappy so far.50 min: Clark and Ritchie probe down the left. Clark is eventually brought down by Traore. It’s a clear free kick, though Traore isn’t too pleased, as he was cynically shoved by Lascelles a few seconds earlier as he romped up the other end, only for the ref to wave play on.48 min: Injury update: Fernandez has a calf injury. So it wasn’t a tactical change. Yedlin has dropped into Newcastle’s back three, with Manquillo taking his place out on the right.46 min: Atsu dribbles down the left. His run is brought to an abrupt end by Doherty. Free kick. Ki takes, and it’s not very good. But a fast start to the half from the home side.And we’re off again! Wolves - who were sent back out onto the field early by Nuno - get the ball rolling once more. Newcastle have made a change, hooking Fernandez and replacing him with Manquillo.Nothing happens at the corner. Ritchie has another go at worrying Wolves, flinging in a cross from the left. But Coady heads clear, and the teams are going in level. Well, that was fun. Don’t go anywhere, now!45 min: So having said that, Diame latches onto a loose Wolves pass and cracks a rising shot goalwards. It deflects out of play to the left of the target, and so Newcastle will have a corner in the one minute that’ll be added onto the end of the half.44 min: A free kick for Wolves out on the left. Neves takes, and curls a harmless one into Dubravka’s arms. This has been a highly entertaining half of football, but it’s petering out a little bit.43 min: Jota runs with purpose down the middle of the park. He thinks about a shot, but slips the ball wide left to Vinagre instead. Bad choice, because Vinagre’s cross is easily hacked clear. Jota had the chance to work Dubravka.41 min: Wolves ping it around for the first time in a while. They don’t go anywhere in particular, but they’ve been second best since taking the lead, so a period of relative control will be most welcome.39 min: Rondon is having a superb game. A study in perpetual motion. Here he closes down Rui Patricio, forcing the keeper to shank a pass out of play. It leads to nothing, but the home crowd appreciate his efforts anyway.37 min: Doherty turns on the jets and bursts through a gap in the Newcastle defence down the inside-right channel. Before he can get a shot away, Ritchie is across to slide the ball out for a corner. A perfectly timed tackle it had to be. From the resulting corner, Bennett heads harmlessly over the bar.35 min: A bit of space for Ritchie down the left. But he runs down a cul-de-sac.33 min: There’s not a lot of this game being played in the middle of the park. Delightful. Doherty cynically clips Atsu’s heel as the Newcastle man makes good down the left. A free kick in a very dangerous position. But it’s wasted, Ki hoicking it miles over everyone’s head and out for a goal kick, with all the big lads up, their time and energy wasted.31 min: Ritchie sends Atsu scampering down the left. Atsu hooks immediately into the centre, slamming the ball into Rondon’s chest. But Rondon can’t control and the ball flies out for a goal kick."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67ec86d9fb5f3beb73e5db5e68909714d8228595/1254_233_3328_1996/master/3328.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0f2f12e48ec0192df2e7fc8f17282ff","title":"river plate v boca juniors copa libertadores final second leg live","story":"47 min: Maidana meets it – but heads over! River have started with plenty of intensity, almost as if they got a dose of the hairdryer at half-time. Martínez, in particular, has been busy, with River attempting to get on the front foot.46 min: We’re back under way in Madrid. Can Boca hold on? River win an early corner after good work by Montiel. Martínez will swing it in.45+1 min: The ball breaks kindly for Boca and, suddenly, it’s 4 v 3 against the River defence, but Benedetto’s pass is poor. He takes the wrong option, slowing the game down by looking to his right when Pavon was unmarked on his left.45 min: We will have two minutes of added time.45 min: Pinola flies through Benedetto in frustration. The Boca end is truly bouncing. It was a fine finish, a slick counter. Benedetto strikes, dropping to his knees in front of a sea of roaring supporters. Boca countered upfield superbly, and the striker applied a composed finish beyond Armani. It could have been so different, had River made the most of a gilt-edged chance moments before after a mistake by Andrada.42 min: A bit of argy-bargy ensues, after a meaty challenge, with the referee booking Pablo Perez for a lunge on Enzo Pérez. 40 min: Boca go close, but Armani does brilliantly to claw the ball away from Benedetto. A brave, two-handed save kickstarted a River counterattack, with Montiel bombing forward 70 yards to attack. The final pass lets River down, with Martinez driving harmlessly over. 38 min: River are attempting to settle things down. It’s all a bit pedestrian, but then, it’s better than Boca having the ball. River look a little predictable.37 min: All of the lads are in the house:35 min: Pablo Perez, for one, is absolutely pumped. Boca do seem a little zippier at the moment, with River more flat. Right on cue, Ponzio pings a wild pass straight out for a goal-kick. Boca will be feeling quietly confident.33 min: Nandez does brilliantly for Boca, wriggling away from not one but two River shirts, before winning his team a foul on halfway. Boca have had the two big chances, and have dominated the last 10 minutes or so. River’s play has been a bit bitty, with Palacios and Pratto largely alienated.30 min: River go straight up the other end, with Pratto going over in the box but the referee is unmoved. Just the one booking so far. 29 min: Boca go close! Benedetto’s strike is poor but, deflected by the River wall, it causes havoc. It drops kindly for Perez, who pings an effort goalwards. It is blocked and the ball duly loops up into the air, but Nandez cannot reach it. Boca thought they had scored for a moment. It whistled past the post.27 min: We have a yellow card, with Ponzio going into the book. It was a hearty challenge on Nandez, but it was one of the cleaner tackles in this game. Boca earn a free-kick right on the edge of the box. They’re queuing up to take it. Perez fancies it.25 min: Boca’s Barrios is fouled, and they have another chance to pile on some pressure. Maidana initially repels the ball in, but Perez tries to keep it alive, before Villa takes over. A neat spell of pressure for Boca. 22 min: Maidana upends Villa on the wing, as River hand Boca another free-kick on a plate. Villa’s trickery caused problems, but the resulting ball in doesn’t, with a deep free-kick evading everybody. River look vulnerable at the back.21 min: Pavon causes panic, and Boca hack the ball away for a corner. River twice nervously cleared to a blue shirt, before eventually alleviating danger.20 min: Ponzio gifts Boca a free-kick on halfway, a chance to have a breather of sorts and regain some territory. It’s all ebbed and flowed nicely so far.18 min: River win a corner ... it’s played short, a training ground routine – but Fernández ultimately makes a mess of it. His left-footed effort is always rising, with the ball angling up into the Gods of the Bernabéu. 17 min: Izquierdoz makes another crucial interception to prevent Pratto from finding joy down the left flank. The full-back is being dragged all over the place by the River forward, but just about holding his own. River are enjoying perhaps their best spell of this game.15 min: River win another free-kick, with Buffarini pulled up for a clumsy foul 25 yards or from goal. It’s played short, but Pavon does well to hound out Pratto.13 min: And then Boca promptly whack the ball straight out of play. It’s all a bit nervy at the moment. Nobody wants to be the one that makes the mistake, or the butt of the jokes in Argentina tomorrow morning. 12 min: Boca win a free-kick deep inside their own half, with Nández fouled just as River seemed to be growing into the ascendency. 11 min: Pablo Perez – the man whose eye injury played a large part in the last game getting called off – has been ubiquitous for Boca. 9 min: Boca chance! Pavon steals possession in halfway, owing to a poor pass out the back by River. Olaza then whips the ball in, and Maidana swings a leg at it. It could have gone anywhere – the huge gasp inside the stadium tells you as much – but in the end it runs out for a corner. Perez hits the target at the back post when it comes in, stabbing an effort at Armani, with Montiel totally absent. 7 min: River boot a long ball up to Palacios, but Magallan and Andrada snuff it out. No problem. Time for some Boca possession.6 min: Boca take an age to get play back started from the throw-in, seemingly in an attempt to wrestle some control of the game. The ball ends up back with Andrada, who soon wellies the ball upfield. And then another crunching challenge by Pablo Perez. It’s a matter of time before the Boca captain goes into the book.5 min: Martínez twists and turns before arriving at the byline, but eventually he overruns the ball. River have started the livelier. Madrid is bouncing.4 min: It’s flighted in towards the back post, but Izquierdoz nods clear.2 min: Benedetto cannot control the ball, and River turnover possession. They fly forward, and the referee is quick to have a word with Magallan. River win a free-kick 20 yards or so from goal ...1 min: River get tight to Pablo Perez, and the Boca midfielder ends up rolling on the floor, clutching his ankle. It was a late challenge.The Copa Libertadores final second leg is under way. Six thousand miles away from home, Boca and Rivers fans have Madrid rocking.Here we go then! We’ve had the pre-match formalities, the national anthem. The football, at long last, is up next at the Bernabéu.Lionel Messi, and his son, are among the thousands in Madrid to watch the final. He is not the only one, with Slavisa Jokanovic also in situ. Messi is unlikely to have paid for a ticket but, according to AFP, the 20,000 tickets allocated to fans in Spain and elsewhere sold out within hours but some of the 5,000 for residents in Argentina remain available. The cost, and short notice, is likely to have put them off. Around 2,500 police officers are expected to attend. Outside, the Paseo de la Castellana, the road that runs from the city centre to the stadium, has been closed off since 9am local time, as police seek to keep rival fans apart. Good news: both team coaches arrived safely at the Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid without any bother, escorted by Spanish police every step of the way. That hasn’t stopped a feverish atmosphere building in the city, with Boca and River fans going bananas, jumping up and down throughout most of the day as the realisation that this match should actually happen – at last. Six thousand miles away and 15 days later than planned, at least. There is an army of security, a layer or two round the entire stadium, a sea of half-and-half scarves and the sweet smell of anticipation.This will whet the appetite, should you need to: Copa Libertadores final, take three: action! And we almost never made it this far, given Boca Juniors’ late attempt to postpone the second leg was rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas). Carlos Tevez, the Boca striker, said it was “embarrassing for the people” to see the final moved to Madrid, after the initial match in Buenos Aires was marred by a River fans attacking the Boca team bus, with talk of tear gas and shards of glass dominating the discourse, instead of the game which was billed as the biggest in Argentine football’s 127-year history. “They took away our dream of playing the final in our country,” Tevez said. The first leg ended 2-2. The second, we are still very much waiting for:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e05fce1107b02f297a5db951742f55703c160540/604_451_2565_1539/master/2565.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=025ca1ceb698469c0338823ed08f0353","title":"fir crying out loud 2018 most underwhelming christmas trees","story":"Readers have been sharing pictures of the least impressive Christmas trees so far this festive season"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/faac2655d5f2ebaee13498e4ac5d97eb5d8a3271/195_0_5326_3196/master/5326.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7829af5b3f40cd52baab6a1bbf9c438b","title":"in the room for the brexit showdown","story":"In July, Nick de Bois found himself as chief of staff in the Brexit department after the sudden resignation of David Davis and the appointment of Dominic Raab.

She’s stuck it out. She is a British bulldog.” Linda Williams is among a group of lively older women putting the world to rights over their knitting, in a cheerfully lit room at Trinity Methodist church, in Kirkby-in-Ashfield.Her sentiment is one heard repeatedly by the Labour MP Gloria De Piero as she chats to voters in her Ashfield constituency, with just days to go before Tuesday’s momentous Brexit vote.The knitting friends voted on opposing sides in the 2016 referendum, but they are united about the hash they believe Britain’s politicians have made of things over the past two years – and the prime minister’s resilience in the face of mounting chaos.“Why are they letting the politicians just walk away?” says Joyce Bradshaw of the string of ministers who have resigned rather than sign up to May’s deal. “Some of the politicians want to be in a person’s shoes – not paddling their own little boat.”“She’s been up against it big-time,” agrees Susan Gilbert. “Her cabinet should have stuck by her.”And there’s scant sense here of anyone here changing their minds about Brexit. “I don’t like Brussels telling us what we can or can’t do,” says leave voter Brenda Walker. “We can stand on our own two feet”.Gilbert agrees. “The reason Brussels doesn’t want us to go is because we put the most money in – we’re giving too much money to other countries.”Judith Stirland, meanwhile, supported remain, and would be happy to go to the polls and do the same a second time. “I voted in. I would like to go and vote again,” she says.De Piero explains that she will vote against May’s deal on Tuesday, and that Labour hopes to be able to force the prime minister back to Brussels to come up with something better.Just down the corridor, against the backdrop of cheerful chatter from a toddler group, retired British Coal worker Mike Wood, who has just turned 75, says he voted remain, and has watched the past two years’ manoeuvres with mounting disquiet.“I think it’s a bit of a mess really. I voted to remain, because I could see that it’s not cut and dried it’s not black and white it’s all very, very grey,” he says.Labour appears to be edging towards the idea of supporting a second Brexit referendum, under intense pressure from grassroots activists.But Wood, while a remainer, is against a re-run. “Now we have voted to come out, we have got to come out, otherwise governments will never be trusted again,” he says. “They had that vote, they said they would abide by it – they’ve got to abide by it.”Kirkby-in-Ashfield is one of three towns that, together with Eastwood and Sutton-in-Ashfield, and much of the surrounding countryside, make up De Piero’s constituency a few miles north of Nottingham. Eastwood was the birthplace of the author DH Lawrence, and the local Wetherspoon’s is named the Lady Chatterley after his racy masterpiece.Unemployment here is not high by national standards, but average wages are low, and De Piero says too few young people see university as an available option.These were pit towns, where the men overwhelmingly worked in the mines and many women in the other once-thriving industry, hosiery, for firms including Coats Viyella and Pretty Polly.Several constituents De Piero meets bring up the 1980s miners’ strike, which cast a long shadow over many families’ lives, and gives a hard edge to the sense of resentment against politicians in London.She fears there would be a significant backlash in constituencies like this if MPs at Westminster were to throw the question of Brexit back to the public to resolve.“People who voted for Brexit are much more likely to say, ‘we feel that politicians don’t listen to us’. This is going to compound that feeling and that sentiment – it’s going to be off the scale,” she says.She had a Twitter row recently with Tony Blair’s former spin doctor, Alastair Campbell, now an ardent enthusiast for a “people’s vote”, who told her, “you and other Labour MPs who are just caving in on Brexit will never be forgiven”.But De Piero says: “A lot of times I read in the papers, my constituents, or constituents who voted leave, are sort of portrayed as angry people who did it through resentment. There’s optimism. They think Britain can be better – and actually, I think it’s not our position to go, ‘well we’re going to prove you wrong’ it should be our position to do our very bloody best to prove them right.”In Scoffers, a Kirkby sandwich bar doing a brisk trade in filled rolls and baked potatoes, that optimism is voiced by local businessman Paddy Moore.He is not reliant on just-in-time supply chains, so the details of a customs union do not bother him too much. “We’re not really going to be affected,” he says. Asked if there should be another referendum, he adds “absolutely not: that is it”.Back in her constituency office – in between ducking out to help the owner of the local Chinese restaurant with a complaint about drains – De Piero says: “I don’t want a second referendum unless absolutely every other single option fails. There is no appetite for that here. People do want to move on and talk about other things. It’s just sucked the life out of our politics.”On a busy day meeting and greeting constituents, De Piero does find one constituent who would be willing to think again.“I have got more information about it now than I had in the first place,” says Chris Varnam, propping up the bar in the Kingsway pub in Kirkby, recently taken over by the chair of Ashfield constituency Labour party, Julia Long.Varnam says politicians have been “lying through their teeth on both sides”.“You start to think, hold on a bit, this is going to affect a lot of people’s jobs – so then you think you made a mistake. There’s more and better information.”Shane Wilds, who has popped in for an interview for a job in the pub’s kitchen and joins in the Brexit chat, was a remainer. “I want freedom of movement: I have had it all my life and I don’t want it to go,” he says.But rather than reach for a second referendum, he says warring politicians in Westminster should put their differences aside and “hug it out”. As Tuesday’s crunch vote looms, with both main parties deeply ided, that looks a forlorn hope."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b14667c16f28218e2816da001a5b4a70fc3861f0/35_296_2867_1721/master/2867.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90ef57263a36e099e038aeb4cace81b3","title":"esther mcvey hard for theresa may to stay if she cant renegotiate brexit deal","story":"Senior Tory Brexiters suggest they could be interested in role should Theresa May be toppledThree Brexit-supporting former cabinet ministers have signalled in television interviews that they would be interested in running for the Conservative leadership if Theresa May is forced to resign after Tuesday night’s critical Brexit vote, in a sign of the prime minster’s crumbling authority.Boris Johnson, Esther McVey and Dominic Raab all refused to rule out leadership bids and called on May to persuade the EU to ditch the backstop and withhold some of the £39bn orce bill, though Brussels has said no further negotiation is possible.Soft Tories immediately sounded the alarm over the leadership jostling, with former attorney general Dominic Grieve suggesting the party could be on the brink of a formal split.Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show, Johnson said he felt a “deep sense of personal responsibility” for the 2016 referendum result and when asked directly about whether he would rule out trying to become prime minister, declined to do so.“I will give you an absolute, categorical promise that I will continue to advocate what I think is the most sensible plan,” the former foreign secretary said, although he dismissed as nonsense speculation he had begun offering Tory colleagues jobs in a future administration.An hour earlier, McVey, the former work and pensions secretary, said she believed it would be “very difficult” for May to stay on if she failed to renegotiate the Brexit deal.McVey did not rule out running for the leadership herself, saying she would do so “if people asked me”. She said she was “looking for a person who can unite the party behind the Brexit deal” and said Brexiters should get behind one candidate, but did not name anyone.Grieve, who authored an amendment for next week that MPs could use to attempt to block a no-deal Brexit, said a formal split looked possible.“There is a risk the party will split and cannot continue in its current form,” he said, adding that Johnson would be a “disastrous leader” for the Conservatives and he would personally find it “very difficult in those circumstances to take the Conservative whip”.The former cabinet minister Justine Greening hinted that she believed parliament was unworkable in its current form. “People are utterly fed up to the back teeth with parliament being stuck on Brexit and nothing else – it can’t go on like this,” she told the .Brexit minister Kwasi Kwarteng played down the prospect of a formal split in the party, although he said it was possible some MPs could resign the whip.“I think that when the party split in the 19th century it was so devastating that the Conservative party is almost wired in its DNA not to split,” he told BBC Radio 5 Live. “I think one or two people might leave, I don’t know who they will be.”Speculation about the leadership intensified over the weekend, with suggestions that the cabinet ministers Sajid Javid and Jeremy Hunt, and the former Brexit secretary David Davis would also run if May were to quit. Javid is hosting a joint Christmas drinks for MPs alongside the Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom.Speculation has also mounted that the newly returned cabinet minister Amber Rudd could be mulling an alliance with the environment minister, Michael Gove, though it is unclear which of them would put themselves forward for the top job.Appearing on Sky News, Raab, another former Brexit secretary, said when asked about his leadership ambitions: “I’ve always said I wouldn’t rule it out, but I’m just not going to get sucked into that debate.” He said the public would think it indulgent to do so.Raab said he believed May could still hang on as leader “even in the event of a big loss on the vote” because he thought “she could still turn it round” by immediately trying to renegotiate the deal. “If parliament has voted the deal down I think she can go and say this deal doesn’t work for the United Kingdom.” Raab said no deal could be a better outcome if May could not force further concessions. “Ultimately we need to be willing to walk away,” he said.Johnson and McVey made similar points about the need to remove the backstop and withhold some of the £39bn orce bill until a comprehensive free trade agreement is signed between the UK and the EU.The prime minister resigns after a humiliating defeat. Many MPs believe she will have to go if she loses by more than 100 votes. An interim prime minister would have to be chosen while the Tory party plans a leadership contest.May begs Michel Barnier, the European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator, left, to go the\u0026nbspextra mile and reopen the talks. She asks for\u0026nbspconcessions over the Irish backstop, and then puts whatever she can secure to a second vote in the Commons.Plenty of Conservative and Labour MPs would be happy to see a soft-Brexit, Norway-style solution that keeps Britain in the single market, as suggested by Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary. Although she has\u0026nbsppreviously rubbished the idea, May could do a U-turn and try to sell it\u0026nbspas a compromise to avoid the disaster of no deal.With her deal ditched, and if “no deal” is also ruled out by parliament, May’s least worst option could be to go back to the people. Many Tory MPs are pushing her to do so. If Labour officially backs the idea, a second referendum –as suggested by Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary – could happen.If parliament cannot agree on what kind of exit from the European Union it wants, and if there is no majority for a second referendum, Britain hurtles towards a no-deal departure on 29 March 2019. A hardcore group of Brexiters led by Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg would rather accept trading with Europe on basic World Trade Organisation terms than May’s deal or any form of soft Brexit.If there is no agreement on anything, and “no deal” has been blocked off as an option by parliament, the other choice available is no Brexit. May or whoever is in charge could form a cross-party government of national unity, revoke Article\u0026nbsp50 and call the whole thing\u0026nbspoff.McVey argued the party’s support for May as prime minister was conditional on renegotiation. She told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday that if May “goes out and gets the deal we want on those key points then she will remain as our prime minister”, adding: “If she doesn’t it is going to be very difficult for her.”Greening, who has said she will vote against the deal in order to push for a second referendum, said it was up to all MPs in parliament to find a way out of the spiral. The former education secretary said she was not convinced that a Norway-style deal would be any more acceptable than the prime minister’s deal.“Communities across the country are telling their MPs they don’t like the ‘one foot in, one foot out’ approach of the prime minister’s deal, but the reality is it’s the same problem with the Norway approach – they just leave everyone unhappy,” she said. “However unpalatable it is for MPs, if it’s gridlock in parliament, then MPs have to allow people to choose and find a consensus for themselves.”Grieve told Sky News that the European issue was of such “fundamental character” that it was clouding all the other issues where Tory colleagues could essentially agree. “That bothers me very much because one of the products of Brexit has been total paralysis on virtually every other area of policy,” he said.He said he opposed Johnson’s leadership because of his record, not just his hard-Brexit views. “It’s perhaps got less to do with issues around Brexit than I’m afraid my own assessment of his competence,” he said.Pressed on McVey’s leadership ambitions, Grieve said: “There are all sorts of people who may wish to throw their hat into the ring. At the moment I’m not very interested in finding a new leader because I think the process of finding a new leader in itself would be disastrous for us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44d686651169a2a0f570754c634c77443adce0d3/0_89_1783_1069/master/1783.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32b0260f4585a5598f122eb710ab7323","title":"parliament to vote on mays brexit deal what happens next","story":"The likely scenarios around Tuesday’s vote and what each could mean for the PMTheresa May is facing the reckoning of her premiership on Tuesday, when she is expected to put her negotiated Brexit deal in front of her mutinous MPs. Here’s what could happen in that fraught 24 hours.The numbers who say they will vote against the prime minister’s deal are going up rather than down. Over the weekend a handful more have added to the tally, including the former chief whip Andrew Mitchell and the ministerial aide Will Quince.That would be more than half of all Conservative backbenchers – those not on the government payroll. Such a defeat would be unprecedented in recent political times and a sign that Tory whips had little effect.Faced with such a defeat, May would need to decide whether to resign or pledge to seek changes from Brussels. Under the terms of the EU Withdrawal Act, she would need to make a statement to the Commons within 21 days – although in practice it would probably take place the following day. Labour may also decide this is the moment to attempt a vote of no confidence in the government or Tory MPs could trigger a confidence vote in May.It is hard to see the prime minister managing to reduce the number of Tory rebels below this number. It is roughly the number of MPs who have either signed no-confidence letters in May’s leadership or resigned from the government to vote against the deal. It would still represent a staggering defeat, but the numbers that have vowed to vote against her deal are so vast that reducing it by half begins to look like an achievement.Under those circumstances, May might be able to keep her job and pledge to seek some cosmetic changes in Brussels or some additional written assurances – or offer some concessions to Labour. It is possible then that she may survive long enough to put the deal again to parliament, perhaps with the hope of additional Labour support. That in turn could also lead to Brexiters forcing a vote of no confidence in May.Highly unlikely, but still technically a possibility. Downing Street remains insistent that this is plan A and there is no plan B beyond it. One of the tactics whips have used to convince MPs is to insist this is the final decision day and that only chaos lies beyond it.Other possibilities include a surprise new amendment or written guarantee on some aspects of the backstop from Brussels that assuages Tory fears. That seems extraordinarily far-fetched at this stage in the game.Even if May wins the vote, she is not out of the woods. Brexiters have threatened to amend and block the legislation needed to enact the withdrawal agreement and the DUP has said its confidence and supply arrangement with the government will be over if the deal passes.The prime minister resigns after a humiliating defeat. Many MPs believe she will have to go if she loses by more than 100 votes. An interim prime minister would have to be chosen while the Tory party plans a leadership contest.May begs Michel Barnier, the European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator, left, to go the\u0026nbspextra mile and reopen the talks. She asks for\u0026nbspconcessions over the Irish backstop, and then puts whatever she can secure to a second vote in the Commons.Plenty of Conservative and Labour MPs would be happy to see a soft-Brexit, Norway-style solution that keeps Britain in the single market, as suggested by Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary. Although she has\u0026nbsppreviously rubbished the idea, May could do a U-turn and try to sell it\u0026nbspas a compromise to avoid the disaster of no deal.With her deal ditched, and if “no deal” is also ruled out by parliament, May’s least worst option could be to go back to the people. Many Tory MPs are pushing her to do so. If Labour officially backs the idea, a second referendum –as suggested by Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary – could happen.If parliament cannot agree on what kind of exit from the European Union it wants, and if there is no majority for a second referendum, Britain hurtles towards a no-deal departure on 29 March 2019. A hardcore group of Brexiters led by Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg would rather accept trading with Europe on basic World Trade Organisation terms than May’s deal or any form of soft Brexit.If there is no agreement on anything, and “no deal” has been blocked off as an option by parliament, the other choice available is no Brexit. May or whoever is in charge could form a cross-party government of national unity, revoke Article\u0026nbsp50 and call the whole thing\u0026nbspoff.The nuclear option remains that the prime minister could decide that there is nothing to be gained in allowing the deal to be put to MPs in its current form. It is unclear exactly how that could be achieved as MPs have already approved the House of Commons’ business motion to hold the vote on Tuesday. A minister could simply decide to talk beyond the time limit so a vote is not held, but would be likely to cause uproar.If May decides it is a risk worth taking, and No 10 insists she will not, she may head to the EU council summit at the end of the week to try to seek some tweaks or concessions, or allow the clock to tick down even longer so MPs begin to feel the heat of a potential no deal. Both are very high risk strategies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8374023dd08a633a80b9676e2fed3b29639cdc2/0_239_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21d6a468f2c413669e2f3af2300b2369","title":"esther mcvey says she would consider tory leadership bid live updates","story":"Caroline Lucas, James Cleverly, Barry Gardiner and Jacob Rees-Mogg to argue their case over what should happen We’ll now close tonight’s live blog. All eye’s to Tuesday’s crucial vote.Thanks for joining us!James Cleverly is back on social media already, reiterating the isions among opponents to the deal – a strategy that Downing Street have been seen to increasingly pursue.However, he stopped short of claiming victory. The hastiness of the debate allowed for few direct political points to be scored, with Cleverly, Gardiner, Lucas, and Rees-Mogg largely speaking rhetorically rather than addressing each other’s points (although at one stage the debate was temporarily reduced to a head-to-head between Lucas and Rees-Mogg). Nonetheless, tonight’s format gave the panel scant time to articulate a comprehensive alternative to Theresa May’s proposed deal. However, Channel 4 was congratulated for providing “much needed reflection of the main strands of parliamentary problem ahead”.My overriding thought right now is reminiscent of many following the general election debate in 2017, in which Theresa May abstained. It feels that somehow - yet again - our leaders are not subjecting themselves to adequate scrutiny.Here are more highlights from the hour long event:Labour has posted a video of Barry Gardiner’s opening statement:As have the Tories for their man:Here are the closing statements:Theresa May’s deal would rip the country in half, Gardiner says, suggesting that it would satisfy nobody. “Labour’s deal secures your job and your future.”Cleverly criticises the positions of the other three panellists on by one and says “Lets just take the deal and get out,” as the debate ends.Guru-Murphy thanks the four debaters for attending, lamenting that May and Corbyn were absent.I’ll post more comprehensive quotes from the debate shortly.Theresa May will have ceased to function as a prime minister in such a case, the Labour shadow minister claims.Rees-Mogg reiterates both the Tories and Labour said they would implement the result of the referendum in their 2017 manifestos. He has continually criticised the people’s vote campaign, directing his ire towards Lucas.“This is all about trust,” he says. “Across Europe politicians are distrusted - there are riots in France and troubles in Italy.“Everybody agreed to accept the result of the referendum. Now Theresa May has said one thing and come back with a deal that does another.”Guru-Murthy then speaks to an audience member who is in favour of a WTO set of rules, under a no deal. Another says such a course would be an “absolute tragedy”, Theresa May’s deal would be better.A final audience member says we need a people’s vote, and the debate comes to an end!Time to revisit the New Statesman’s profile of Jacob Rees-Mogg, says the magazines political editor.Gardiner says that we need another general election, but Lucas says that Labour’s position would not be all that dissimilar to the Conservatives’.A people’s vote would be the best way to tackle the grotesque inequalities in the UK, Lucas says.Rees-Mogg asks whether she would then want a third or fourth referendum, presumably if the result did not go in the direction she preferred.Lucas then highlights historic hypocrisy on Rees-Mogg’s part. This is turning into a bit of an argument between the two.The younger generation will be more betrayed than anyone else, says Lucas in response “One thing that is already clear by tonight is that this decision cannot be left to the politicians. We simply can’t agree.“This not a parlour game or debating society. These are real people with real lives”That’s why the people need to have their say, she says. “A people’s vote would be your first chance to vote upon the facts.“Don’t leave it to the Westminster elite to decide for you,” she says to whoops and cheers.Earlier she suggested that people campaigning for a no-deal are only doing so because they would be insulated from the ramifications of that course of action.Everyone poses for a selfie taken by tonight’s host."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a947f623170b9b88fd6bcff6d74930770947450/78_0_2729_1638/master/2729.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2599f760a18ad1e282627ea2ca4eb6a","title":"pensioner poverty rises bnefites freeze","story":"One in six pensioners is now living in poverty as a result of declining home ownership, soaring rents and the benefits freeze, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has warned. Pensioner poverty is rising, having fallen steadily for nearly two decades, the charity said. The figures prompt fears that many pensioners will be forced to choose between paying for heating and buying food this winter, as benefits remain frozen below inflation for the third year in a row.The foundation’s chief executive, Campbell Robb, said: “Pensioner poverty is a problem that we thought had gone away.”The problem is compounded by the benefits freeze, in place since 2016. “As rent goes up faster than housing benefit, pensioners have a huge gap to fill,” Robb said. “This tips people into poverty, and forces them to choose between food and heating.”The foundation called on the government to end the benefits freeze and to build genuinely affordable housing. “These figures are part of a wider increase in poverty across all age-groups,” said Robb. “If we don’t tackle the causes now, we fear that we are going to see poverty – particularly among pensioners – rise even more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eebf28f53b1070caf8a100c3b41d68b5135f2dd2/0_40_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4abe6823c79ca087485eed7ad922434","title":"what happens when your child becomes violent with you","story":"Under my desk is an antique iron. It has been there since the day my mother hid it from my teenage son. That day, attempts to get him up had repeatedly failed. He was hungry but refused to eat, he became increasingly volatile until eventually he threatened to hurl the iron at my head.I’d had enough objects thrown at me in the past to not take any chances. I ran out of the house and for the first time called the police. While I waited for them, my son punched through a window, the resulting cut narrowly missing his artery.Tom, 17, has various diagnoses – autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Tourette’s, ADHD – that make it hard for him to communicate, deal with frustration and regulate his emotions. As he has grown older, he has become more challenging. He was exhibiting a range of coercive and obsessive behaviours centred on me that made life intolerable. I had a choice around these behaviours: I could carry them out … or else.“Or else” could mean screaming for hours, punching, kicking, threatening with heavy or sharp objects, property damaged – or me, my other children – and neighbours kept awake into the early hours and sometimes all night. “Or else” could mean my son harming himself it was the unspoken catalyst to my life shutting down.While some may find this shocking, for others it’s a familiar story. A freedom of information request last year revealed that in the year 201516, 10,051 cases of domestic violence against adults by children were investigated by 35 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales. Of these cases, 874 led to cautions being issued and 1,459 to juveniles being charged with offences.“My feeling is that it is more widespread,” says social worker and CPV campaigner Helen Bonnick. “I am seeing lots of links with CPV and children and young people’s mental health – so if, as we are told, that is worsening you would expect there to be a knock-on effect.”CPV and APV are more prevalent in particular groups – children with mental health problems or special needs the adoption and fostering communities families that have experienced domestic violence and where young people are abusing substances.Children within these risk groups may have “several overlapping issues”, says Bonnick. Early trauma, such as neglect or living with domestic violence, may have affected the way they react to stress – or had a modelling effect. Children who are abusing substances may lash out while intoxicated or demand money for drugs. Like Tom, those with mental health issues may be living with such high levels of anxiety that it takes very little to tip them into fight, flight or freeze.“Fundamentally,” says Bonnick, “we see young people who are trying to cope with the demands of life, and are having to ‘speak loudly’ to have their needs met. They may find stressful situations extremely hard to manage because of a neurological condition or early trauma. They may have learned that violence pays off in achieving certain ends.”However, CPV and APV is not exclusive to these groups. Rachel Condry found that APV occurred across the social spectrum and that while it is more commonly against mothers by sons, a significant proportion of fathers were victims and daughters perpetrators. In some families there was a clear cause, in others Condry said she “literally could not find a reason”.Tip of the iceberg What is clear, is that the problem is much wider than reported – “for very understandable reasons”, says Suzanne Jacob, chief executive of domestic abuse charity SafeLives. “Those who experience intimate partner violence only call the police at a rate of one in five. We can all see the reasons why you would be even less likely to call the police about your child – and not just the police – there is so much attached in terms of any stigma people feel, and in terms of worries about consequences for themselves and the child.”Shame and fear can prevent parents seeking the help they need – as can lack of understanding from family, friends and agencies. “The kind of dismissiveness people in previous times applied to intimate partner violence is still applied to CPV,” says Jacob. “People end up minimising what is actually an incredibly serious issue in somebody’s home.”The insidious nature of domestic abuse also plays its part. “It can build up gradually,” says Bonnick, who runs the campaigning and resource website Holes in the Wall. “It takes a while to acknowledge that you are being abused … because it’s become so normal,” she says.Her observation resonates. I once described to a friend the lengths I had to go to in order to have a shower – reasons that included sleeping as long as I could after being awake most of the night, and also because often Tom would repeatedly batter the bathroom door. “You do realise,” she said after a long silence, “how very far from normal your life has become?”I did, and didn’t. In fact, all of us – my son, myself, and my two younger teenage children – existed in a kind of suspended reality. The scale of how wrong things were meant that when I did start contacting agencies for help, I found it almost impossible to articulate the problems.And in common with many, I had an uphill job getting people to really hear what was happening.“I think often people do ask for help and get knocked back – passed from one agency to another,” says Bonnick. “It can be very difficult to find where to go in the first place, and then even if you do approach an agency, what sort of help do you get?”It’s a good question. The reality is that there is no national blueprint for dealing with CPV and the quality of help families receive is patchy. “What you get is pockets of good practice,” says Condry, “but a lot of areas where there is practically nothing.”“There has been a massive retraction of funding for child and adolescent mental health and local services, and cuts in youth justice as well.”Last summer Jacob, Condry and Bonnick all took part in the consultation for the government’s draft domestic abuse and violence legislation. They are unclear as to whether CPV will make its first appearance in a domestic violence bill. And while there are benefits to it being included, such as raising its profile, Bonnick is wary about drawing too many parallels with adult abuse.“There is a problem with identifying with adult perpetrators because we might not want to get sucked into the sort of response that is considered appropriate for that. Children are still young and growing, and habits are not so fixed. There is much more hope for change.’Whole family protection Inclusion in the bill might, however, be a step towards families accessing the help they need.I am convinced that our own situation only changed because I started to call the police. Concerns followed about the welfare of my younger children. Our case was presented at the monthly Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference (Marac), which put pressure on services to act. I was allocated an independent domestic violence advocate (Idva) from an organisation called Splitz, which offers support services to people experiencing domestic abuse. We met regularly and her support was crucial in keeping our case on the radar.Chrissy Stower, area manager for Splitz, says that while recognition of the problem has improved, there is still a long way to go.“The system is geared up for parent on child abuse, not the other way round,” she says. “This is seen as a ‘parenting’ issue with the child not being seen as being at risk from the parent. We have to expend a lot of energy in making the case to achieve support for child on parent abuse cases.”Condry agrees: “We’ve heard of families who have gone to social services and been told there’s no younger siblings in the family so it’s not a protection issue. We would argue very strongly that if a young person is being violent in the family there’s a massive safeguarding issue because he or she is not developing in a way they should be.”Condry is also clear that seeing CPV as a parenting issue is an over-simplification. “I am really reluctant to dwell on explanations that involve blaming parents,” she says. “There are so many complexities in families that this happens to.“It’s impossible to work with this by adjusting your behaviour, filling out a worksheet or trying to lay down boundaries,” she says. “That sort of thing is not going to work if someone has lived under siege for a couple of years.”“Burnout” is the phrase Condry says parents used often in her research to describe the impact of APV. At the family level, child to parent violence contributes to family breakdown, economic hardship and mental health problems.My relationship with Tom’s father did not survive our disagreements over how to handle him. As Tom’s violence and coercive behaviour became worse, I watched my other children fall apart, one began to behave self-destructively and the other withdrew further into his phone.I could barely work because I was getting so little sleep, and because Tom’s coercive behaviours took up so much time. I tried to visit my GP to talk about my own mental health, but all I could do was sob wordlessly. And all the while, I worried desperately about Tom – my inability to place boundaries meant that he was putting himself at risk, mixing with people who were exploiting him, and dabbling in drugs. “What medication are you on,” an attending police officer asked me one night. “None,” I replied. “Then how are you still standing?” he asked.And there is a wider social cost to consider. In research published in 2009, Syliva Walby, distinguished professor in sociology at the University of Lancaster, found that domestic violence and abuse cost the UK an estimated £15.7bn in 2008. If CPV is now as widespread as some people believe, then the associated costs to the economy will be significant.“You would imagine that if you did apply the economic cost of CPV and APV it would be massive,” says Condry. “Somebody who works in the youth justice field told me his suspicion was that a very large number of kids taken into care, especially in the 14-plus age range, would be due to family breakdown because of violence in the home,” she adds.Fund support services“There is a good case to be made for support services being funded to save a lot of money in the long run,” says Condry.It is clear to me that support services are not getting the funding they need now. I sensed frustration among the police officers attending us that they were working with blunt tools and being left to make difficult judgment calls. Emergency foster and respite centres had been closed, so they were faced with the tough choices of putting a vulnerable youth in a cell, sectioning him, or walking away.Tom was moved out of our home in the summer. My life now is radically different. I can work, I can even go out for the evening. But I still can’t sleep. Putting my child into care was searingly painful. I am often paralysed by recriminations, guilt and despair. I no longer look at baby pictures.Tom lives in his placement on the other side of our town. He is bewildered, angry and doesn’t properly understand why he is there. His capacity to make sense of what is happening to him is limited, and he is unable or unwilling to face up to his actions, leaving little room for us to repair our badly broken relationship.As Tom approaches adulthood, my influence over what happens to him will decline dramatically. I had always envisaged that I would house and care for him for as long as he needed me. Without my support, I fear greatly for his future – with it, I fear for mine.If you have been affected by the issues in this article, please visit holesinthewall or safelives.org.uk.

At least there were no riots or tear gas canisters inside Racing’s stunning new indoor home but an 80-minute water cannon bombardment might have been less arduous than some of the on-field punishment they soaked up en route to a 14th defeat in their last 15 European forays across the Channel.It says everything about the Tigers’ current situation that conceding a mere five tries almost counted as a triumph. Had Racing played the entire match at the same pace and intensity as the first quarter it would have been an annihilation to their credit Leicester fought gallantly right to the end, registered four tries of their own and, scoreboard-wise, managed to avoid another total wipeout following their 41-point humbling in Bristol the previous week.On another sobering weekend for many of England’s Champions Cup representatives, they were partly assisted by Racing’s regular attempts to out-Harlem the Harlem Globetrotters rather than grind the Tigers into the 4G carpet, particularly when the visitors had first Manu Tuilagi and then Ellis Genge yellow-carded. The French heavyweights will find Welford Road a slightly different environment on Sunday but Leicester may just consider they have weathered the worst of the storm as they seek to stay alive in pool four.They will still need to win their last three matches to qualify but George Ford, Matt To’omua and Tuilagi are starting to combine nicely and Sione Kalamafoni delivered another colossal performance in one of the more extraordinary sporting environments anywhere in the world. Short of throwing a rugby ball around on the Starship Enterprise it is hard to imagine a more surreal backdrop for the game the only gilet jaune on view, though, was worn by the referee Nigel Owens, who presumably changed into a different coloured top before heading out into the night.Leicester, either way, were aggrieved to be awarded only two penalties by Owens in the entire game and did remarkably well, all things considered, to win the second half 12-10 having conceded a try bonus point before the interval. Some of Racing’s approach work was sublime, with Finn Russell’s inch-perfect long pass in the build-up to Juan Imhoff’s superb 13th-minute try a thing of particular beauty.Russell, along with Virimi Vakatawa and Simon Zebo the dextrous, both rewarded for their enterprise with a try apiece, was again the architect and flanker , with Baptiste Chouzenoux crashing over for his side’s fourth after 33 minutes, Racing looked on the verge of making a major statement. But, despite losing Jonah Holmes to concussion and Matt Smith with a dislocated shoulder, the Tigers’ own determination to play at pace and fight fire with fire were rewarded with a quartet of well-taken tries, the highlight arriving when Tuilagi roared round the outside to take Mike Fitzgerald’s pass and beat the cover.If the result was never in doubt even before Olivier Klemenczak’s 60th-minute try, Leicester’s interim director of rugby, Geordan Murphy, was suitably encouraged by the way his team kept going, culminating when Ford led another long-range break-out and a quick throw-in helped release Adam Thompstone for the all-important bonus point try. “I don’t think you can question the endeavour and the passion of the blokes in the shirt which is something we didn’t do last week,” suggested the former Ireland full-back. “We conceded too easily in the first half and gave ourselves a mountain to climb but I was really proud of the boys. It was probably a great game to watch if you weren’t coaching in it.”The Leicester hierarchy has poured scorn on reports claiming Harlequins’ Paul Gustard is on their wish-list. Murphy, though, confirmed the club’s board is looking to reinforce the current setup when and if the right people become available. “If we can support any of our coaching team,myself included, and bring quality people into our environment to make the club better, then I’m all for it,” he stressed. “The board have been really good. They’ve said they’ll give us whatever support and help we need.”Whoever they engage is not going to resurrect the Tigers overnight. Racing and Ulster remain the favourites to progress from this pool and Leicester’s away record is not pretty. Tigers, moreover, have not won back-to-back matches in this tournament since 201516, which hardly inspires massive confidence. Civil unrest may be rife in France’s cities but, as things stand, it does not seem to be distracting their leading rugby teams."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1218fc1e1eb64c9032e71765eaa636b84d0d768a/0_58_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87f0ad791199371fae7bc7cd08a28fbe","title":"ronnie osullivan v mark allen uk championship snooker final live","story":"And that’s the mid-session interval: Allen really needed at least three of those frames and, while he scrapped nicely to take two, it surely won’t be enough.

Frame nine: O’Sullivan 6-2 Allen O’Sullivan has to work a bit with the remaining reds, runs slightly out of position on a brown and in turn on the penultimate red, misses the latter and lets Allen back in. O’Sullivan 61-25 AllenFrame nine: O’Sullivan 6-2 Allen And again: this time Allen is unlucky as a long, ambitious red flaps between the jaws of top right, and leaves it right over top left. O’Sullivan sinks that, then a black, and should probably clean up from here. O’Sullivan 31-25 AllenFrame nine: O’Sullivan 6-2 Allen Ooof, Allen doesn’t look like he’s cueing right. He goes for a relatively straightforward red down the left cushion, but it rattles the pocket and goes out. Luckily for him, he hasn’t left anything of note on. O’Sullivan 23-25 AllenFrame nine: O’Sullivan 6-2 Allen V unlucky for Allen - he goes for a plant to break up the pack - he pots the red and breaks up said pack perfectly, but leaves the cue hiding among those reds and only able to see the green. O’Sullivan 22-25 AllenFrame nine: O’Sullivan 6-2 Allen Jinxed it: O’Sullivan sticks 22 away in quicksmart time, but tries to get rid of that red on the top cushion, it flicks said cushion and leave the red over the pocket. Now the table looks good for Allen...Frame nine: O’Sullivan 6-2 Allen Allen goes for a mid-long range red into the right corner, misses and leaves the white near the blue. O’Sullivan sinks a red right into the middle of the other corner, and other than a red on the top cushion, things look nicely placed for a big ol’ break.And we’re away. O’Sullivan - remember, leading 6-2 - breaks left-handed, the scamp. And here’s Ronnie O’Sullivan, music choice ‘Rock ‘n’ Roll Star’ by naughty Manc rockers Oasis. Mark Allen is introduced into the arena, accompanied - naturally enough - by Gala’s ‘Freed From Desire’. The old, comforting BBC intro music begins. Here it is in full.Fancy a spot of historical, pre-match reading? This, on what turned out to be the apex of Alex Higgins’s career, is excellent.Has there ever been a more...apathetic is the wrong word, but ever been a champion sportsperson who gives the outward impression that they could take or leave being a champion, more than Ronnie O’Sullivan. Upon being asked how great it would be to surpass Steve Davis’s mark if six UK Championships, O’Sullivan noted that he would be “over the moon”, but also that if he didn’t get it done this year, then there’s always next year.It will take quite the comeback from Mark Allen to make him wait 12 months: O’Sullivan goes into this evening session requiring four of the potential 11 frames to retain the title and bring his personal collection to seven. In a sense, it’s probably this sort of match that has led to O’Sullivan’s on again, off again relationship with snooker: he’s on his way to winning the second-most prestigious title in the game, and he’s barely broken metaphorical sweat. Still, if Allen takes a few early frames we could be in for a longer evening.

In Deborah McAndrew’s adaptation (★★★★☆), reworked at Leeds Playhouse after last year’s run at Hull Truck, he is also bothered by a band of cheeky poltergeists. With delighted giggles, they hide his slippers, shift his table and swap his nightcap for a Santa hat. In Amy Leach’s vigorous production, it brings a note of humour to rub up against the Victorian penury, disturbing apparitions and grouchy misanthropy. Alongside the songs by John Biddle, given gutsy ensemble renditions, it adds variety to a show with narrative clout.Broodingly lit by Josh Carr, the candles flickering in intensity as the unearthly smoke bellows, Hayley Grindle’s set transfers the business of Scrooge and Marley to a gloomy Leeds warehouse where the labour is tough and relentless. Here, Pickavance’s Scrooge morphs from a cranky taskmaster, his voice prone to shrill outbursts as his shoulders give neurotic shrugs, into a sonorous humanitarian, instantly humbled by the visions before him.It’s a rapid transformation that makes his eventual reconciliation all the more touching. That is also because McAndrew foregrounds the dilemma of the sickly Tiny Tim (a sweet and vulnerable Seb Smallwood, alternating with Lipalo Mokete), emphasising what is at stake for a poor family at the hands of an unscrupulous employer. On the wide temporary stage of the Pop-Up theatre, the production is direct and engaging, making what feels like a public avowal of the values of a civic society one, to coin a phrase, for the many not the few.At the end of Mark Calvert’s in-the-round staging of A Christmas Carol at Northern Stage (★★☆☆☆), the audience leaps to their feet in approval. You can see why: they’ve been served such an exuberant feast of carols, jazzed up with bubbling Caribbean rhythms by composer and musical director Dr G Hannabiell Sanders, that sitting still seems impolite. One minute Sanders is pounding out the fidgety Latin beats, the next she is leading the company on the bass trombone. If there is a Christmas party anywhere with this much life and soul, let’s hope we’re all invited.Under the movement direction of Martin Hylton, the large cast treat the Neil Bartlett adaptation as if it were a Broadway musical. The show is full-voiced and boisterous, forever erupting into festive song and dance.And therein lies the downside of Calvert’s production. For while this is a story in which everyone bar Scrooge knows how to enjoy themselves, Dickens didn’t write a novel about a feelgood party occasionally interrupted by a morose old man. Nick Figgis plays Scrooge as a credibly grumpy boss rather than a misanthropic caricature – an interesting decision, but too subtle to compete with the razzmatazz about him. It’s not his fault the pathos, the politics and the change of heart are swept away by the showbiz fun and games.Staged on Rhys Jarman’s fluid early-20th-century set, which switches from industrious office to derelict factory, the production favours theatrical dynamism over focus on the plot. It is big and flamboyant, where the story calls for sensitivity and restraint. On the large open stage, you get little sense of poverty and cramped living little feel for the impact of Scrooge’s meanness and therefore little understanding of the radical release when his attitude changes. It is full of hearty commitment but misses the point.• At Leeds Playhouse until 19 January and at Northern Stage, Newcastle, until 5 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ff9f903813d0b123e7015d2fb21bdd394aabba4/0_46_1288_773/master/1288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=003ab1423400f089aa13ca3092610eda","title":"how hot dogs got haute fashions fast food love in","story":"From the humble grilled cheese sandwich to classic burger and fries, Anna Hart discovers how comfort food is getting a luxury makeover as part of our everyday extraordinary series. All images captured on the Google Pixel 3A decade ago, grabbing a burger was a quick fix, something we did when we were short of cash, time or imagination. For modern diners, going for a burger is a quest. A quest for excellence: gastronomic, ethical and aesthetic excellence. In cities around the globe, dishes that would once have been termed fast food – pizza, grilled cheese sandwiches, tacos and hot dogs – are being taken as an art form, with fiercely loyal cult followings on social media and five-star newspaper reviews by food critics previously accustomed to starchy tablecloths and foamy, fiddly haute cuisine offerings. On Twitter and other social media platforms, diners furiously debate the merits of a Bleecker burger over a Patty \u0026amp Bun burger on the Mexican front, Breddos and DF Mexico vie for the crown of best tacos in London, and the gloves are off between devotees of Pizza Pilgrims and Franco Manca.This is the golden age of flash food – poshed-up fast food – when the most sought-after meals around the UK are sophisticated versions of simple staples.“I think haute cuisine has been put in its place,” says chef Gizzi Erskine, author of Slow: Food Worth Taking Time Over. “We now take comfort in simple dishes that mean something to us, that may have been pushed to another level from technique and ingredients. Plus, we care much more about the ingredients – provenance, breed and how things are farmed – so there’s a new understanding that a great piece of meat cooked simply is enough.”A menu is one of the most telling barometers of any society, indicating our shifting aspirations, economic circumstances, ethical and health preoccupations and how we choose to socialise. “This is definitely a sociological trend as much as about food tastes,” says Damien Gabet, editor of Square Meal magazine. “It’s no longer cool to shout about that Michelin-starred meal you ate off starched tablecloths, but there’s cultural capital to be gained from going out and Instagramming a meal from the most hyped food truck in town.”Social media has significantly fuelled the trend for superlative versions of simple dishes. “Fine-dining fare doesn’t actually photograph that well and generally looks fussy and drab,” says Gabet. “Whereas, dishes such as tacos and burgers have distinct outlines and vibrant colours.”In London, few figures have done more to champion affordable new restaurants, informal supper clubs and food trucks than Clerkenwell Boy, an anonymous food influencer with close to 200,000 followers on Instagram (@Clerkenwell_Boy). “I started Instagramming to try and make food more accessible and less elitist,” he says. “Because, while there is a place for special-occasion fine-dining, on a Tuesday night with friends, we generally want affordable but delicious meals served family-style, in a no-frills setting but with relaxed and friendly service.”And while we might be dining out more, this doesn’t mean we’re lowering our standards. “If we go out for a burger, we want it to be the best burger in town,” says Clerkenwell Boy. “We want to eat simply, but we want it to be the absolute best version of that dish.”As Trish Caddy, Mintel’s senior foodservice analyst, puts it: “Millennials – the generation most likely to consider themselves as ‘foodies’ – have developed an acquired taste for artisanal flavours such as dry-aged meats and smoked cheese, partly out of a desire for visceral, intense experiences that stimulate their senses.”And although consumers are increasingly health-conscious, there’s also been a shift in what we consider an “unhealthy” meal. Burgers and pizzas are no longer demonised there’s a new understanding that excessive sugar, sweeteners, additives and heavy processing are the real culprits in poor health and obesity.“So, instead of eating low-quality processed meats such as fatty pepperoni and sausages, millennials are seeking out functional ingredients like fermented foods that tap into the ongoing gut-friendly food trend,” says Caddy. “For example, sourdough pizzas, which feature purported health benefits that come from the fermentation process, have a distinctive sourness compared to ordinary pizza bread dough. This suits millennials, who have grown accustomed to food with intensive flavours as well as health benefits.”And if diners are rediscovering simple pleasures, the good news is that these dishes are also immensely satisfying to prepare. “Cooking should be about everything from sourcing great ingredients to the therapeutic rituals of breaking down the recipes,” says Erskine. “And everyone should be able to eat, and cook, this way.”The Curiosity Rooms events take place at 55 Regent Street from 15 November to 16 December 2018.

All images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Stephanie Sian SmithVibrant, arty and home to one of London’s most erse communities, Peckham has cemented itself as a true cultural hotspot – with creative hub Peckham Levels, the legendary Bussey Building and no shortage of galleries and cafes just a few of its draws. But long before SE15 was named by Time Out as one of the world’s coolest neighbourhoods, it was the stomping ground of blogger and best-selling author Chidera Eggerue.With 187,000 Instagram followers, Eggerue is now known globally by her online moniker, the Slumflower – a name borrowed from Street Etiquette’s concept of a rose growing from concrete. Her debut book, What a Time to be Alone: the Slumflower’s Guide to Why You Are Already Enough, is now in its third print run and she has recently published her second, Scribble Yourself Feminist. Growing up in south-east London, Eggerue mirrors the Slumflower message of growing, glowing and flourishing in an urban environment. Here, she presents her very personal guide to Peckham, reflecting on the everyday extraordinary places that fire up her imagination …Taste some proper Nigerian foodI live with my mum and two brothers and I don’t really eat out much as my mum is an amazing cook. She makes jollof rice, egusi (a type of melon seed) soup, beans and yam. She also shops local and buys her meat and vegetables from the market in Peckham.But if you want to know a good Nigerian restaurant in the area, I would suggest 805 Restaurants – I get plantain and jollof rice. Afterwards, stop by Cafe Spice, a small, yellow shop opposite the Bussey Building. Look out for a Nigerian snack called a puff puff, which is very sweet and like a fried doughnut.Kick back with a drinkJohn the Unicorn is really nice, or Prince of Peckham – it does great chicken, and has really good DJ sets and there’s a party room upstairs. It’s quite new but it’s where I’d go with friends now. People do of course go on to club nights at the CLF Art Cafe – known locally as the Bussey Building (during the summer months there’s a rooftop bar and cinema), but I’m like an 80-year-old granny and just go home!Head to the only cinema worth knowing aboutOnce a month I take myself on an evening date to watch a film at Peckhamplex. I’ve been going there since I was born and it’s still the only cinema I go to – at a fiver a ticket, you can’t go wrong. I saw the new Incredibles film recently, which I loved it was so cute. Going there and having time to myself is important. What is now above it – the creative workplay hub that is Peckham Levels – used to be a multi-storey car park. My dad used to park there before we went to the cinema and he’d whizz around the levels, it was so much fun. Frank’s Cafe is there now, on the rooftop, but it’s not really my thing.Look out for inspiring wall artWhen I was younger, there was a wall by Peckham library with photos of famous black actors, who I very much aspired to be. The bus I took to secondary school went past it, so I’d see them every day from age 11 to 16. Now the murals are on the walls of the Peckhamplex, which I love.Hit up my beauty go-tosPaks Hair and Cosmetics is where I get my hair treatments, conditioners and extensions. I also go to Anna’s nail shop once a month to get my nails done. (Find it in Ali Baba’s barber shop on 127 Rye Lane.) It’s £25 and quite expensive. I always get pointy nails shellac all the way. I get the brightest, neon colours I can. My tip? Get Anna’s son to do them – he’s the best.Get a coffee fixI get my coffee at the Costa on Rye Lane every day, but it’s not very Peckham! It used to be a Mothercare. My mum would always go in there with me and just the other day I was looking at an old film of me in there, which we still have on tape. There was more footage of me in my pram and walking through Peckham. There were green buses then – they were so cool – and the McDonalds is in shot, which is still there.Find some headspaceSexby Garden in Peckham Rye Park is my hideout, my reflection spot – my secret favourite place.

From rethinking your routine to noticing art and culture around you, as part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, here are 10 ways to appreciate the magic of the everyday. All images captured on Google Pixel 3Most of us are settled into our routines. Wake up, check emails, grab a coffee, hop on the train, get to work. It’s not our fault, it’s the efficient way that our brains work. “Having this autopilot mode allows the conscious mind to be freed up for other tasks,” says Gemma Griffith, a director at the Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice at Bangor University.However, autopilot mode can have its downsides. By being so wedded to our ingrained habits and routine we can risk becoming disconnected from other people and our surroundings, and missing out on everyday magic. For Griffith the remedy is simple: “It’s about switching back to ‘being’ mode rather than ‘doing’ mode and focusing our attention on the present moment”. Here are 10 ways to shake up your routine and relish the everyday.Take time outYou don’t have to trek to the top of a mountain to find inner peace. Whether you’re on your commute or taking a lunchtime stroll, take the time to open up your awareness. “Focus on your walking, how your feet feel on the ground, the temperature of the weather at that moment, and the sounds you hear,” says Griffith. Coax your mind into the present moment by taking a different route home or trying out a new lunch spot.Be more basicFashion’s love affair with utilitarian dressing continues, with pared-back basics the lynchpins of Instagram’s most followed fashion icons. “The current appetite for streetwear and the rise of high-street stores that specialise in stocking classic key items, such as brands like Arket, prove that the trend for basics is going nowhere,” says stylist Laura Martin. The humble white t-shirt, the classic hoodie and ordinary gym trainers have never been more on trend. The good news is, they’re probably already in your wardrobe.Rethink your favourite foodsThe internet has turned eating into an art form. While home chefs could once have lived a lifetime using only Mrs Beeton’s Cookery Book for company, today we are googling ambitious dishes then feverishly photographing and hashtagging the results. But have we forgotten the simple pleasure of ordinary meals and ingredients? As the zeitgeist turns towards a balanced approach to eating, bloggers such as the Ugly Vegan are performing the seemingly revolutionary act of sharing unfiltered, familiar dishes. For your next evening in, why not grab a bag of imperfect veg and create something extraordinarily ordinary?Notice art around youYou don’t have to go to a gallery to appreciate great art and design: seek out signs of creativity all around you. If you’re in London, look up Art on the Underground’s Brixton mural map, leading to examples of street art in the area dating back to the 1970s and 1980s. Based in Manchester? Check out the street art tours on offer by writer Hayley Flynn, who set up bespoke tours of the city to put a spotlight on the local landscape of the Northern Quarter, which is packed with rich history. Over in Bristol, the tourist office has published free, downloadable walking tours of Banksy’s work.Discover hidden librariesFrom repurposed old red phone boxes to shelves at the train station, hidden libraries are popping up everywhere. The literary scheme Read Now, Write Now has teamed up to create book exchange shelves along the Wirral train line, and Clapham North tube station in London has a book swap shelf located at its entrance. Over in Crossmichael in southern Scotland and Amberley in Stroud, locals have turned their old phone boxes into mini libraries. The pleasure in these new makeshift lending libraries? “You get to discover new gems,” says Fruzsina Bekefi who runs a monthly book swap out of east London reading nook Libreria. “It’s a great way to widen my horizons and inject a bit of serendipity into my life.”Find a new perspective There are more than 4m posts for #lookup on Instagram and with good reason: from intricate architecture to stunning skies, there’s so much you could miss if you keep your eyes trained on the ground. And as we shuffle along our daily tramlines, our thinking can get stuck in a rut too. Head up a hillside or tall building for a fresh look at where you live, or mix up your commute by getting off a stop or two early and walking the rest of the way.Discover hidden historyWhether you are a fan of poets, musicians, athletes or writers, it’s worth keeping your eyes peeled for the English Heritage blue plaque scheme. The plaques dotted around London point out where notable creatives lived in the city, from children’s author AA Milne to the black composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. The English heritage scheme has also influenced other local areas across the UK to celebrate their histories, too – so look out for blue plaques in Brighton and Hove, South Tyneside and Leeds (thanks to the local Leeds Civic Trust).Shake up your workoutIf your idea of exercise is headphones and a running machine, why not break the habit and explore a more sociable way to exercise? GoodGym hosts running meet-ups across the UK, combining fitness with an activity that benefits the local community. Jog to meet an isolated elderly person, sort out cans at a food bank or pitch in to tidy someone’s garden. A recent study from the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine in the US proved that team exercise can lower stress and improve quality of life.Appreciate moreBusy doesn’t have to equal stress – it’s all about how you approach it, says Griffith. “Do a routine activity mindfully, whether that is brushing your teeth or eating breakfast in the morning, by adjusting your senses to what you are doing,” she says. The benefits of mindfulness are worth it. “It’s a practise that lowers the stress hormone cortisol. It encourages those who apply mindfulness to their daily lives to have more compassion for themselves and others,” says Griffith.Get back to natureGwyneth Paltrow’s love of grounding has been well documented (and much maligned), but how about a spot of forest bathing? This new nature buzzword refers to a rising trend in green spaces inspired by a Japanese tradition. Try it by heading to your local forest or woodland trail and soaking up everything you see, touch, hear and smell. Even if you can’t make it that far afield, swap that “al desko” lunch for some much needed vitamin D – it’s the perfect pick-me-up when daylight hours are in such short supply.The Curiosity Rooms events take place at 55 Regent Street from 15 November to 16 December 2018.

The armed forces of Myanmar, known as the Tatmadaw, also carried out murders, imprisonments, enforced disappearances, torture, rapes and used sexual slavery and other forms of sexual violence, persecution and enslavement, while in northern Rakhine, the mission also found evidence of mass extermination and deportation.Andrew Stroehlein, the European media director of Human Rights Watch, tweeted: “I’m no expert on meditation, but is it supposed to make you so self-obsessed that you forget to mention you’re in a country where the military has committed mass killings \u0026amp mass rape, forcing hundreds of thousands to flee, in one of today’s biggest humanitarian disasters?”A Twitter user, Jeff Strabone‏, wrote: “People complain about how Twitter empowers Nazis.

We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

Thank you for joining in - I’ll be back next week for the GRAND FINAL, when Ashley, Stacey, Faye and Joe will take a final spin in pursuit of the Strictly Glitterball. Pretty sure we predicted that final four in about Week 3, and I have high hopes for some great dancing. Kick off is a 6.30pm next Saturday, so I’ll see you then! Have a great week, HxLauren and AJ take to the floor to dance their final dance to Whitney’s ‘Didn’t We Almost Have It All’. Alright, don’t rub it in.“It’s always been about ability, not disability”, says AJ. They’ve been an extraordinary partnership, and what a journey for Lauren. Felt like those words from both of them were truly heartfelt, bit dusty in here. Obviously all the judges vote for Ashley and Pasha, which means LAUREN AND AJ are going home. They’ve been phenomenal contestants – Lauren has grown in confidence and style every week, and AJ has shown what a great teacher and choreographer he is. I’ve loved watching them every week, and they’re hugely worthy semi-finalists. And now time for Lauren and AJ’s Tango. This is considerably better than last night, with a good deal fewer mistakes. Sadly it won’t be enough, but lovely for Lauren to go out having nailed that routine.First up in the dance off it’s Ashley and Pasha! I loved this American Smooth last night, am very happy to watch it again. It’s still gorgeous, albeit the one-legged lift didn’t look quite as confident.Faye is having a cry - for their Showdance they’re doing something elegant and sophisticated. Yeah I want that from a Waltz, not a Showdance. Another montage! I’m really looking forward to next wee’s final - it’s going to be a corker. It feels like a while since we last had a dance off featuring any kind of ‘who will it be?’ tension, doesn’t it? Alas tonight is not going to change that. On the upside, we get to watch Pashley’s American Smooth again, and their Showdance next week will be EPIC – I’m really looking forward to seeing it. So who is joining Ashley and Pasha in the bottom two? If it’s Faye, things are going to get interesting. If it’s Lauren, not so much. In the bottom two: LAUREN AND AJ, which means Faye and Giovanni are through to the final!Time for a judges’ montage - think of it as a warm up for next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a383b3b5ea9e8175bfc3ba3e7f056ff932182cb/0_238_3621_2172/master/3621.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37c841ca3d132a98f0c5fda6e95666ad","title":"alexandria ocasio cortez ayanna pressley progressive house democrats future","story":"A female-led ‘squad’ of upstarts is taking aim at power structures on Capitol Hill while pushing priorities such as healthcare and action on climate changeAs transportation secretary Elaine Chao addressed newly elected members of Congress at an orientation event in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a handful of Democratic freshmen slipped out into the winter cold to join a healthcare rally.With their brief absence from the biennial conference, a staid affair hosted by the Harvard Kennedy School, the progressive warriors of the House’s new majority sent a clear message.“I was not sent to Washington to play nice,” Massachusetts congresswoman-elect Ayanna Pressley told the crowd outside. “I was sent to Washington to fight, alongside all of my colleagues, to save and to improve lives.”Pressley, who unseated a 20-year incumbent on a message of “change can’t wait”, is part of a women-led, social-media savvy “squad” of upstarts taking aim at the power structures on Capitol Hill.Already, they have used a pitched leadership battle to demand coveted seats on powerful committees such as appropriations and ways and means, assignments typically reserved for senior lawmakers while continuing to agitate for priorities such as universal healthcare and action on climate change.Such a noisy Washington debut has the political class – and Democratic leadership – wondering how these new faces intend to wield their power. Will they be a leftwing incarnation of the far-right Freedom Caucus or will they prove to be dependable bloc within the governing majority?One thing is certain, says House Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) chair Mark Pocan: “This isn’t your mother and father’s progressive caucus.”However, he rejects comparisons to the Tea Party renegades who consistently defy Republican leadership.“The difference is the Tea Party liked to say no, and we like to say yes,” he told reporters while introducing the group’s newest members last month. “We’ve got lots of great policy ideas that we’re going to be advocating for.”To many leftwing activists, the election of Pressley, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York and Rashida Tlaib in Michigan was a validation of the progressive agenda. They view many in the party establishment as insufficiently liberal and beholden to corporate interests – and are urging the newly-elected members to seize the moment.But that could prove a headache for Democratic leaders, trying to protect the party’s fragile House majority. Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, has said their priority is to to improve the Affordable Care Act rather than rushing to replace it with a single-payer health care plan.“There is a collective urgency among members in this room to get things done,” said Lori Trahan, an incoming House member from Massachusetts who joined the healthcare rally on Tuesday.In her view, the Democratic caucus has little appetite for intransigence.“Even if it’s something more narrow than what we talked about in our campaign,” she said, “building the muscle to work together on something small is a good place for us to start.”The incoming progressives have so far fallen in line with Democratic leadership. Rebellion has instead come from a group of moderates demanding fresh faces and new leadership.If Pelosi prevails in her bid for House Speaker, it will be in no small part due to the support of newly elected liberals. Her victory could embolden them to push for hearings and votes on signature policy initiatives such as Medicare for All and a Green New Deal.Despite the high-profile progressive victories, the party’s majority runs through corners of the country that supporter Donald Trump in 2016. Some moderates worry that allowing progressives to dominate the party’s messaging will hurt less liberal members, especially those in districts previously held by Republicans.“The strategy of the caucus must be one of supporting the members who are most likely to lose,” Jim Himes of Connecticut, outgoing chair of the centrist New Democrat Coalition, told reporters.Ideological differences between progressives and pragmatists are overblown, he said, suggesting that keeping control of the House in 2020 will require firing up liberals and swaying moderate voters.“We need our young people,” he said. “We need our base. We also need persuasion.”Even before taking the oath of office, the Democratic rising stars are bringing change to Capitol Hill. Ocasio-Cortez, who at 29 will be the youngest woman ever to serve in Congress, has used social media to bring followers behind the scenes of freshman orientation.“Welcome to Hogwarts,” she said in an Instagram story, spinning the camera to reveal the soaring architecture of the Capitol.On Twitter she vowed to pay her interns $15 per hour, after learning that most members offer unpaid internships. “Time to walk the walk,” she tweeted, and then spent time answering questions from online users about how her operating budget would work.This week, she and Tlaib used Twitter to criticize the Harvard conference for including lobbyists and business executives but not labor organizations or activist groups.“Lobbyists are here,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted from the closed-door event. “Goldman Sachs is here. Where’s labor? Activists? Frontline community leaders?”Ro Khanna, a progressive who ousted a Democratic incumbent to win his Silicon Valley district in 2016, said of the newcomers: “They are demystifying the halls of Congress on social media and giving ordinary Americans a view on how their democracy truly functions.“Most important, they are restoring a sense of idealism to politics – reminding all of us that the only reason to come to Washington is to try to do big things for our country.”Elizabeth Holtzman, a former congresswoman from New York who in 1972 shocked the political establishment when she upset a 50-year House veteran and became the youngest woman ever to serve in Congress, at the age of 31, recognizes their desire to shake up Washington.But she offered a cautionary tale in getting what you want, based on her own “inauspicious start”.She arrived in Congress determined to avoid the House judiciary committee. But the Democratic leaders ignored her protests and she begrudgingly accepted her assignment.More than a year later, Holtzman realized her good fortune when she took a seat behind the dais at the start of hearings on the impeachment of Richard Nixon.“I lost my first legislative battle,” she said. “But I was thrown into the middle of history. Sometimes it’s good that you don’t get everything you wish for.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91da92bdc6b8cb3d323d5eff16c7caad478cbfe0/0_142_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c28502009a5a9728b2f68396e85b88c8","title":"scott walker wisconsin republican power grab tony evers","story":"Scott Walker’s legacy as governor of Wisconsin will depend on whether he vetoes Republican moves to limit the power of his successor, governor-elect Tony Evers said on Sunday.Evers defeated Walker in November’s election. Republicans controlling the state legislature then moved to pass in a lame-duck session a slate of measures aimed at transferring to the statehouse power from the governor and attorney general – another election won by a Democrat.The bills passed and now await Walker’s signature as he comes to the end of his second term in office. He has indicated that he will sign. Amid similar moves by Republicans in Michigan and elsewhere, the situation in the badger state has attracted national attention.Writing for the  on Sunday, former Wisconsin senator Russ Feingold said Republicans were guilty of “a total betrayal of the people of Wisconsin and our nation’s democratic ideals”.Speaking to NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday, Evers said using the word “coup” to describe the Republican move “seems strong”. But he did not rule out seeking legal redress.“I communicated with Governor Walker over the telephone a few days ago,” Evers said, “and laid out my position that vetoing the legislation was going to be an important thing to make sure what happened last November, the vote of the people of Wisconsin was actually upheld…Walker, he said, “was noncommittal”.Evers added that he was “not particularity encouraged at this point in time, but it’s on Scott Walker’s legacy” to veto the bill. Walker, who briefly ran for the 2016 presidential nomination, has had a transformative effect on Wisconsin, particularly in reducing the political power of unions.“The entire thing is a mess,” Evers said, “it’s a hot mess, and I believe he should veto the entire package. At least three or four of the things that are in there now he has actually vetoed previously.”Asked if he would sue if Walker did not stop the power grab, Evers said: “All issues are on the table. I’m not making any promises one way or another. I need to stand up for the people of Wisconsin. There’s 2.6m people that voted in this last election and they expect me to do that. So we’re going to pursue this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6db3b7da67096e107ab44734185cc8e94acc3d56/0_276_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=938e61520e6ffab97e8ad890a0cd5b43","title":"belgium government loses majority over un migration pact","story":"Prime minister Charles Michel says country could come to standstill in event of early electionsThe Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, is fighting for his political survival after the Flemish nationalist party quit the ruling coalition over his support for a UN migration agreement, leaving him in charge of a minority government.After the resignation of ministers representing the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), the largest of the coalition’s four parties, Michel was forced to present himself on Sunday to Belgium’s King Philippe.Michel was given permission to form a minority administration but at a press conference later in the day he appealed to MPs in the federal parliament not to force an election.Belgium is due to go to the polls in May, and with European elections also due that month, the prime minister insisted a change of government would drive the country to a standstill.Michel said: “I want to enter into a dialogue with parliament: if there would be early elections, if it were the choice to push the government towards early elections, then we are in a situation that would block the country for a year.“The personal relationships with the N-VA ministers will remain good, as far as I am concerned,” he added. “But there was a difference of opinion, and I regret that.”The health minister, Maggie De Block, who will now also take on the migration portfolio, replacing the N-VA’s Theo Francken, said she had inherited a “mess” but that she would have a humane migration policy.“I am taking on a department in crisis. It’s chaos,” De Block said in a statement.Francken responded on Twitter that he had “no lessons to learn” in matters of humane treatment.The N-VA’s leader, Bart De Wever, had warned Michel that his party would walk out on the coalition if the prime minister flew to a UN conference in Marrakesh on Sunday to endorse the UN migration pact.“If we no longer have a voice in this government ... there is no point in continuing,” De Wever said.The non-binding UN agreement, which would promote a common global approach to migrant flows, was initially supported by all four parties in Belgium’s coalition, only to be later rejected by the N-VA.Michel said on Sunday that the pact provided “the opportunity for better European and international cooperation”.The French far-right leader Marine Le Pen and Steve Bannon, a former adviser to the US president, Donald Trump, denounced the pact at an event hosted by the rightwing Flemish nationalist party, the Vlaams Belang, in Brussels on Saturday.“The country that signs the pact obviously signs a pact with the devil,” Le Pen said.The US dropped out of talks on the pact last year and countries including Italy, Hungary, Austria, Poland, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Australia have rejected it.

Qatar has denied the charges and said the boycott aims to impinge on its independent foreign policy.At the summit’s opening session, Kuwait, a traditional mediator in the region, urged all sides to end the damaging persistent disunity. Its emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, specifically called for an end to the media campaigns he said had planted the seeds of discord in the region.The level of Qatar’s ministerial delegation was not known until the last minute, with some questioning whether it would attend at all. It was led by the minister of state for foreign affairs, Sultan bin Saad al-Muraikhi.The emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, was personally invited by King Salman of Saudi Arabia, and his decision not to attend will be seen as significant. The letter from King Salman was the first formal contact between the two countries at such a senior level since the boycott began.Qatar has been critical of Saudi operations in Yemen, supported the Iran nuclear deal signed in 2015 and has expressed its sympathy to the family of Jamal Khashoggi, the murdered Saudi journalist.In a sign of unabated tensions before the summit, the Bahraini foreign minister accused Qatar of committing itself to Iran, in effect burning its bridges with its GCC partners.Qatar last week underscored its independence from Saudi Arabia by pulling out of the oil cartel Opec. It is one of Opec’s smallest oil producers but the world’s biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter and its exit from the oil cartel deepened the sense that a resolution to the Gulf row was unlikely.The one-day summit is due to discuss strategic military cooperation, including how to approach the Yemen peace talks, including continued support for the joint Saudi-UAE efforts to drive the Houthi-backed militias from power in Yemen. In the wake of last year’s summit, Saudi and the UAE announced the formation of a joint coordination council that looked as if it might substitute for the GCC, and so formalise Qatar’s isolation.But at the opening of Sunday’s summit, King Salman said he wanted the GCC, designed as a customs and political union for the six Gulf states, to survive.A complete boycott of the summit would have risked damaging Qatar’s own standing at a time when Saudi’s traditionally close relations with the US are under pressure over the Saudi court’s involvement in the murder of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist.Commenting ahead of the summit, the Gulf analyst and Chatham House fellow Kristian Ulrichsen said: “The personality-driven policies pushed by the crown princes of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Salman and Mohammed bin Zayed, have fractured Gulf politics in more ways than one.“Tensions exist also between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and between Oman and the UAE, in part over Abu Dhabi’s policies in southern and eastern Yemen and toward the broader Horn of Africa and Indian Ocean littoral.“Neither Kuwait nor Oman, to say nothing of Qatar, shares the hyper-hawkish approach of Riyadh or Abu Dhabi to regional affairs, and are aware that they may be next to come under pressure to conform to the Saudi-Emirati geopolitical and foreign policy straitjacket.”"},{"url":null,"title":"charity prints from the irish times","story":" photographers have produced a gallery of images that will make a unique Christmas gift.

Despite the presence of several seats of learning here I continue to be surprised at the absence of any serious scholarship tracking the step changes happening before our eyes.Recently, I listened to former Democratic Unionist Party first minister Peter Robinson when he gave a speech to the Knock Methodist Centre in East Belfast. Later, some of those in the audience told me they are now learning Irish.Let us not exaggerate the numbers of those in the Protestant community who are doing so, but their actions are in contrast to the crass denigration of the language by some in the DUP, such as party leader Arlene Foster or Gregory Campbell.Once upon a time, Peter Robinson might have agreed, or did agree with such views. But he grew comfortable during his years in government dealing with “crocodiles” such as Martin McGuinness and fellow Sinn Féin Irish-speaking personnel, unlike his colleagues.Can you imagine Robinson’s thoughts on the Irish language as he watched his colleagues letting the issue of the treatment of it lead to the collapse last February of a deal that would have restored the Stormont institutions.Speaking at the Knock Methodist Centre, he said: “I couldn’t care less about the Irish Language. Let them speak it until they are green, white and orange in the face, as long as it doesn’t encroach on me. This was ‘such a small issue’ – smaller than, say, the devolution of policing and justice and, before that, agreeing the conditions for that Paisley-McGuinness Executive.”The DUP incontrovertibly reached a deal in February with Sinn Féin. Equally, it is incontrovertible that the DUP later resiled from that deal, leaving former ministers and its negotiators, Edwin Poots and Simon Hamilton, exposed and potentially damaged.The bona fides of the secret agreement, which Brian Rowan I reported on in Eamonn Mallie. com in the days after the collapse of the talks, were contemptuously challenged by Jeffrey Donaldson, Foster and Campbell.However, it is time to nail the big lie peddled by the DUP that Sinn Féin was responsible for collapsing the February 9th negotiations because of what the DUP call Sinn Féin’s “red lines” on the Irish language.Instead, the DUP negotiating team had bought into an agreement that embraced the Irish language. Initially, it had Foster’s blessing. Indeed, top Irish and British officials returned home that Friday evening confident the deal was in the bag.The DUP grassroots rose up over the weekend when news broke that British prime minister Theresa May and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar were due at Stormont on Monday, February 12th, to give the emerging agreement their imprimatur.During that weekend, Foster was overwhelmed by forces in her own party, including one DUP MP who told me that he took “one look” at the document after he returned from London and told the negotiators “it won’t fly with the grassroots”. The MP said it was impossible for the party to sell a package that better acknowledged the place of the Irish language given that the DUP leadership had run a campaign of abuse against it for nearly two years.The leadership panicked and the rest is history. Merrion Street in Dublin and Downing Street were left speechless on Wednesday, February 14th, after Foster tweeted: “In our view there is no current prospect of the discussions leading to an Executive being formed.”During his speech to the Knock Methodist Centre, Robinson drove a horse and coaches through the DUP leadership’s contestable history of what had happened during those days in February.“I wish the draft agreement that unravelled in February had been leaked earlier,” he said. Robinson argued that many of the fears wrongly raised in advance about quotas in the Civil Service having to speak Irish and Irish language street signs everywhere, proved groundless.The damage done then to the working relationship in February between the DUP and Sinn Féin may prove to be irreparable, certainly in the short to long term. Indeed, it could be argued that Sinn Féin has every reason to sit and wait.The United Kingdom’s impending Brexit from the European Union and the bitterly-contested withdrawal agreement May concluded with the EU27 in Brussels, should it stick, might discourage Sinn Féin from returning to Stormont.Republicans could interpret that the agreement’s terms are a tinkering with, or fracturing of, the place of Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland that this is something positive and not to be discouraged.This point has to be tempered, however, by an acceptance that the deal agreed by May is surprisingly favourable to Northern Ireland, when viewed solely through economic eyes. Such a deal was considered illusory by nationalists at the outset.The confidence and supply agreement between the Conservatives and the DUP keeping May in power blindsided nationalists to any potential good flowing from Brexit. The EU May withdrawal deal came from left field.Nationalists had been feeling abandoned by Downing Street, left to the mercy of a daily London-centric, patronising DUP cacophony coming at them in waves, where Nigel Dodds and his fellow DUP MPS strutted the Westminster stage.In the eyes of nationalists the DUP have wrongly assumed it has authority to speak on behalf of all in Northern Ireland, despite the fact the majority voted to stay in the EU.The May-EU deal has been begrudgingly welcomed by Sinn Féin because it would guard against a hard border. But the reality is that if it holds, a big if, admittedly, then Brexit will do more to redefine Northern Ireland’s status than occurred during 30 years of IRA violence.Sinn Féin will likely hold back from signing up to any Stormont arrangement with the DUP. They know that the sword of Damocles hangs above that party until the cash-for-ash ( Renewable Heat Incentive) scandal inquiry reports in the new year.Sinn Féin is wary about Foster’s ability to deliver a deal. And they would need to be certain that she can deliver in any fresh negotiations. Republicans are mindful too of another shift occurring – there is a sea-change in attitudes of middle-class nationalists.This is not an accident. Doctors, dentists, solicitors, people in business and in many walks of life, from a Catholic nationalist background, ashamed of the IRA’s campaign of violence, much of it visited upon their Protestant neighbours in salubrious residential areas, and in the workplace, kept their heads down during the Troubles and got on with their lives.However, that has changed – to invoke the immortal words of WB Yeats on the back of two words, “crocodile” and “Brexit”. “All changed uttlerly changed.” Middle-class nationalism is no longer sitting on the fence.They like what they know, see and hear in Dublin under the leadership of Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney. They are proud of the Republic as a 21st century State, where its leaders sit comfortably at the Brussels table unencumbered by the historical labels of religious and social conservatism.This fact has not escaped Robinson’s attention either who remarked, while addressing the Methodists in east Belfast, “you can’t speak now of Home Rule being Rome Rule” south of the Border.The hurt – and there is no other word – visited upon nationalism in 2017 by Foster when she said, “if you feed a crocodile it will keep coming back and looking for more” was incalculable.Though the DUP leader was directing her remarks at Sinn Féin’s demand for an Irish Language Act, the injury was felt by all nationalists not just those interested in the language. Reading between the lines, they judged that parity of esteem was not on offer in what Foster calls “my precious union”.That one word did more damage to any nationalist sense of belonging to the patch of land they inhabit than anything ever uttered by former Northern Ireland PM Basil Brookeborough who in 1933 said: “Many in this audience employ Catholics, but I have not one about my place. Catholics are out to destroy Ulster. ”One wonders whether Robinson’s intervention creates a more conducive environment, providing wriggle room for Foster when “parity of esteem” for nationalists next comes back on the table.Unionism believes the sparkle from that sonorous jewel – our precious union – is in danger of losing much of its radiance as a result of the May withdrawal agreement. This is debatable since Northern Ireland’s constitutional position is guaranteed under the terms of the Belfast Agreement.The DUP is clutching desperately at their sense of Britishness. And they genuinely feel the May package poses a threat to their identity politically, constitutionally and culturally. In essence what unionism is desperate to protect is its “parity of esteem” as citizens of the UK.The deficit in the unionist psyche is that it has continuously refused to acknowledge that nationalists also feel they have an entitlement to parity of esteem. This denial to nationalism by unionism is responsible for the absence of a government in Northern Ireland.The DUP’s time in the sun was short lived. Their 10 Westminster MPs proved incapable of keeping a check on their exuberance and sense of self-importance flowing from their agreement with the Conservative party.Soon, allegations of “betrayal” and “vassal state” emerged from the DUP as it warned its deal is with the Conservatives, not with May. It will be interesting to see how long that crutch will bear the political strain.The atmosphere in Westminster fuels the DUP sense of paranoia and its conviction that Northern Ireland is being treated differently from the rest of the UK. It leaves them at risk, too, of ridicule for placing their trust in Conservatives.History students will recall former British prime minister Ted Heath’s proroguing of the Stormont government in the 1970s, Margaret Thatcher’s 1981 secret contacts with IRA hunger strikers, the 1985 signing of the Anglo Irish Agreement over the heads of unionism and former British PM John Major’s secret back channel to Sinn Féin in the early 1990s. The withdrawal agreement is but the latest act in the Conservative-unionist drama.In truth, the DUP is a party that staggers from crisis to crisis and from scandal to scandal.What leader of a large political party wants to have to stand up at its annual conference and wear sackcloth and ashes as Foster did last month in her address over the cash-for-ash scandal.I have observed enough down the years to know that at moments like these where there is talk of any threat to Northern Ireland’s constitutional status this can be accompanied by “rustling in the undergrowth” by loyalists.While the opposition role being played by the DUP to the so called back-stop agreed by Theresa May and the EU to prevent a hard border may serve as a safety valve, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, I suspect will be keeping an ear to the ground.Remarkably the DUP finds itself for the first time at loggerheads with the Ulster Farmers Union (UFU), the Confederation of Business Industry, the NI Retail Consortium, the Chamber of Commerce and several food and drink umbrella groups which are all taking a contrary position on the May withdrawal deal to the DUP. Some of these groups went over the heads of the DUP MPs to meet May in Downing Street.In turn, DUP MP Sammy Wilson accused businesses backing the deal of being “the puppets of the Northern Ireland Office”, while the usually unflappable DUP chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson lost his temper when speaking on The View BBC One Northern Ireland.There, he said, “the UFU and business leaders – they are wrong. I don’t believe they have read the detail of this, they have not read the 500 pages. There are serious constitutional and economic implications of this deal for Northern Ireland.”Such words did not go down well, particularly after Foster indulged in Trumpian politics by claiming that the media is trying to drive a wedge between her party and Northern Ireland’s business community.That opposition to the DUP’s stance has not diminished.For the first time there are signs of fissuring in middle-class unionism. The retired surgeon Terry Irwin who calls himself an Irish unionist tweeted recently: “The DUP have convinced many ‘soft’ unionists like myself to seriously consider whether we would be better in a United Ireland.”Prof Jim Dornan, an obstetrician-gynaecologist, is now entertaining the idea of a new Ireland. He said: “I would traditionally be thought of as being quite happy with the union and I have been. It has been very good to me, educationally and health wise and everything else in my life.”On whether he thought a Border poll would mean a victory for Irish unity, he said: “Against the union as we have at the moment, there is a lot of people nowadays, not just me, who are saying ‘you know what, if somebody offers me a better deal and somebody offers me a good deal, then I would go for it’.” He added, “everything is on the table” after the Brexit vote.I underscored earlier the sea-change in middle-class nationalist opinion. The fluidity of thinking in middle-class unionism – people of business and professional backgrounds cannot be ignored. Around dinner tables some traditional unionists are now openly questioning where they want to be politically – some thinking the unthinkable – living in a new Ireland. The changes may be subtle, but they should not be ignored.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Bandar al-JaloudAFPGetty A Gulf Arab summit called for regional unity as Bahrain and Qatar traded barbs over the Qatari emir’s decision not to attend the gathering in Saudi Arabia on Sunday in a sign that a row between Doha and its neighbours is still festering.Qatar sent its state minister for foreign affairs to the annual one-day summit, which was overshadowed by the economic and diplomatic boycott of Doha since mid-2017 by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt over allegations Doha supports terrorism, which Qatar denies.“Qatar’s emir should have accepted the fair demands (of the boycotting states) and attended the summit,” Bahraini foreign minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed al-Khalifa said in a tweet.He later slammed the final communique for not addressing the boycott, which Qatar says aims to curtail its sovereignty.The Gulf Co-operation Council’s (GCC) summit of six member states was held as Riyadh faces international pressure over the October 2nd murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate.Saudi Arabia’s King Salman opened the gathering, urging fellow member states Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, the UAE and Qatar to maintain a united front against Iran and terrorism.“This requires all of us to maintain our countries’ gains and to work with our partners to preserve security and stability in the region and the world,” he said in a speech.The leaders sat around a table in awkward silence at the close before a bland final communique was read out, stressing the importance of maintaining GCC unity in the face of threats to regional stability and to meet economic challenges.The UAE will host the next summit in 2019.Doha last week abruptly announced it was exiting the oil exporters’ group Opec after 57 years to focus on gas, in an apparent swipe at the bloc’s de facto leader Saudi Arabia. Riyadh has resisted US pressure to restore ties with Doha following Khashoggi’s murder, an act that drew condemnation and scrutiny of the kingdom’s assertive regional policies.Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir reiterated in a press conference after the summit that Doha must meet the boycotting states’ demands and that the dispute would not affect military co-operation.A US state department official on Sunday urged Gulf states to mend fences to confront Iran and enable a proposed Middle East Strategic Alliance grouping the GCC, Egypt and Jordan. – Reuters "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

To make this work, the other train operators and, in particular, Network Rail, must have learned the lessons which our committee’s report starkly highlighted. “With the inevitable Christmas shut-down for engineering works, and with the unions yet again holding the most precious time of the year to ransom, these timetable changes need to work to enable long-suffering passengers to get back home for Christmas.”Delays and cancellations will hit some of the country’s most crowded rail routes when RMT members on South Western Railway launch fresh strike action on December 22 in the long running dispute over the role of train guards.It is the final Saturday before Christmas and traditionally sees city centres flooded with shoppers making a last dash for presents.Members of the union on Northern Rail are striking for 24 hours on every Saturday for the rest of the year in the same dispute.Tim Farron, MP for South Lake District, has said that they service the operator Arriva is providing is “simply not acceptable”.The strikes come alongside engineering work which will see severe disruption on several lines, including out London Paddington, London Victoria and Manchester Victoria, some of the busiest stations in the country.Network Rail is warning that some routes will have significant changes to normal services and urged people to plan their journeys as early as possible.Bruce Williamson, of campaign group Railfuture, said that he was hopeful that the latest timetable changes would not be too disruptive as they are fairly modest, but he noted: “There is always a risk. The best laid plans of mice and men often go awry.”He said “Undoubtedly rail users have had a difficult year. The strikes are regrettable as this is still a dispute about guards and this is an issue that has been resolved on other franchises. Why is it persisting in these regions? There is clearly a solution. This is frustrating, annoying and inconvenient for passengers.”Strictly Come Dancing 2018 semi-final results, live: Lauren Steadman eliminated after dance-off defeat to Ashley Roberts\u0026#39Thai bride\u0026#39 dumped on Yorkshire Dales may have been murdered by English husband, new evidence revealsGarrick Club \u0026#39considering\u0026#39 vote on allowing women entry for first time in 187-year history Suspected British drug lord goes on trial in ParisAsbestos present in \u0026#39nine out of ten\u0026#39 NHS hospitalsUniversities launch drive to recruit more white males as low numbers give them \u0026#39minority group\u0026#39 statusTwitter chief Jack Dorsey mocked for \u0026#39tone deaf\u0026#39 Burma commentsGatwick \u0026#39signage\u0026#39 blamed as airliner takes off with dangerously little runway leftEU official known as the \u0026#39monster\u0026#39 of Brussels \u0026#39wants to take over as chief Brexit negotiator\u0026#39 Man accused of murdering British backpacker in New Zealand to appear in court as brother gives heartfelt tributeRemote Canadian town to get drone delivery serviceSiege politics as Democrats discuss impeachment of Donald Trump over hush paymentsNew CDU leader seeks to distance herself from Angela MerkelJared Kushner \u0026#39maintained private contacts with Saudi Crown Prince after Khashoggi murder\u0026#39Boris Johnson says he has \u0026#39deep sense of personal responsibility\u0026#39 for BrexitInside the Dutch province where gas extraction tremors left houses crumblingDuchess of Sussex\u0026#39s father releases her handwritten letters and details of first wedding in latest bid to reconcileThousands protest against Tommy Robinson\u0026#39s \u0026#39Brexit Betrayal\u0026#39 march in London Wanted: a family-friendly opera that won\u0026#39t \u0026#39terrify children unduly\u0026#39Thousands protest against Tommy Robinson\u0026#39s Brexit betrayal march in London We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/12/09/TELEMMGLPICT000182792493_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqGw_8_YqFn6oOhW46YSWn9SnJ5Axt_dPFfgBF_QqPcg.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"inside dutch town fracking tremors left houses crumbling","story":"The house of Janneke Ockels in Zandeweer, The NetherlandsThe village of Doodstil - which translates as \u0027dead quiet\u0027 in Dutch - feels like it could have been named as part of an elaborate joke.Despite its name and appearance, this cluster of homes surrounded by flat, green fields and picturesque dykes actually sits in an unlikely earthquake zone.Fifty-five years of conventional gas extraction from Europe’s largest field have made The Netherlands’ province of Groningen anything but calm.Now, warned of the risk of a catastrophic earthquake that could cost lives and homes, the Dutch government is gradually turning off the tap to a gas field that has delivered it more than €265 billion (£237 billion) since 1963.This northern province of just over half...To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeAlready have an account?

bride","story":"Retired Detective Chief Inspector Adam Harland is pictured where the body came to restA body found dumped in the Yorkshire Dales more than 14 years ago may have been a Thai bride murdered by her English husband, new evidence has revealed.The woman, nicknamed the lady of the hills, was discovered by a group of walkers lying in a mountain stream on 20 September 2004.She was wearing just a pair of socks, green Marks \u0026amp Spencer jeans and had a broken bra hanging off her left arm.Police never found out who she was or how she ended up half-naked at Sell Gill Holes caves near Yorkshire\u0027s famous Three Peaks.They decided the death was not suspicious and that she perhaps got lost then died from hypothermia - sufferers can undress believing they are overheating.But new forensic evidence, which emerged after the file was re-opened by a cold case team in 2016, could shed some light on the mysterious death which has baffled investigators for years.It showed that the unidentified woman grew up in south east Asia then spent the last two years of her life in a rural community in north Lancashire or south Cumbria.The wedding ring she was wearing was traced to Bangkok, leading investigators to believe she had married an Englishman in Thailand then came to live in the UK.Retired detective chief inspector Adam Harland, the lead investigation, thinks she was murdered by her husband then dumped in a secluded a mile from the main road and several miles from the nearest town of Settle.A sketch of what the woman is believed to look likeHe told BBC News: The term Thai bride does not necessarily mean the woman comes from Thailand but that she is a lady who has taken up a relationship with a white gentleman and has come back to live in the UK in the late 1990s or early 2000s.The fact that no-one has reported her missing suggests the relationship has broken down and her disappearance was because she\u0027s \u0027gone back home\u0027. In this case, her partner had a natural excuse to explain her absence and for that reason I think, for now, he\u0027s got away with it.Stable isotope analysis, which was not available back in 2004, was used to find out where the woman was living before her death. Scientists studied the levels of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen in samples of her hair, teeth and bones.This provides information about drinking water and soil which could shed light on a person\u0027s previous location.Tests on her bones and teeth confirmed she grew up in south east Asia and a hair sample had isotopes on it found in just a few places in Britain, including south Cumbria and northern Lancashire.The woman was found off a rocky track which can only be reached using a 4x4, leading investigators to believe the killer lived in a rural location.It is also thought the murderer had good knowledge of the area because the body was not dumped in the Sell Gill Holes caves where walkers often visit, but was instead positioned out of sight under a hump in the grass.The woman was likely aged between 25 and 35, weighed about 10 stone and was 4ft 11ins tall, with shoulder-length dark brown hair. In 2007 a coroner recorded an open verdict and she was buried in Horton in Ribblesdale after the parish council stepped in to organise her funeral when no one came forward to identify her.Pathologists concluded she had been dead for between one and three weeks and had been in the open air for just a few days.They found no obvious injuries which might explain her death and her organs were so decomposed that they could not determine if she died of natural causes.North Yorkshire Police told The  they do not have any new information about the case.Strictly Come Dancing 2018 semi-final results, live: Lauren Steadman eliminated after dance-off defeat to Ashley RobertsGarrick Club \u0026#39considering\u0026#39 vote on allowing women entry for first time in 187-year history Suspected British drug lord goes on trial in ParisAsbestos present in \u0026#39nine out of ten\u0026#39 NHS hospitalsUniversities launch drive to recruit more white males as low numbers give them \u0026#39minority group\u0026#39 statusTwitter chief Jack Dorsey mocked for \u0026#39tone deaf\u0026#39 Burma commentsChristmas rail passengers facing perfect storm of delays and disruptionGatwick \u0026#39signage\u0026#39 blamed as airliner takes off with dangerously little runway leftEU official known as the \u0026#39monster\u0026#39 of Brussels \u0026#39wants to take over as chief Brexit negotiator\u0026#39 Man accused of murdering British backpacker in New Zealand to appear in court as brother gives heartfelt tributeRemote Canadian town to get drone delivery serviceSiege politics as Democrats discuss impeachment of Donald Trump over hush paymentsNew CDU leader seeks to distance herself from Angela MerkelJared Kushner \u0026#39maintained private contacts with Saudi Crown Prince after Khashoggi murder\u0026#39Boris Johnson says he has \u0026#39deep sense of personal responsibility\u0026#39 for BrexitInside the Dutch province where gas extraction tremors left houses crumblingDuchess of Sussex\u0026#39s father releases her handwritten letters and details of first wedding in latest bid to reconcileThousands protest against Tommy Robinson\u0026#39s \u0026#39Brexit Betrayal\u0026#39 march in London Wanted: a family-friendly opera that won\u0026#39t \u0026#39terrify children unduly\u0026#39Thousands protest against Tommy Robinson\u0026#39s Brexit betrayal march in London We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/20/21/david-davis.jpg","title":"house prices uk brexit property market london decline halifax index","story":"IM Subscribe  registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Property prices in the three months from September to November fell 1.1 per cent compared with the preceding quarter, while prices dropped 1.4 per cent between October and November. Meanwhile, the rate of growth dropped to 0.3 per cent, the lowest rate since December 2012. Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, said: “High employment, wage growth and historically low mortgage rates continue to make home ownership more affordable for many, though the need to raise a significant deposit still acts as something of a restraint on the market.

Mike Scott, chief property analyst at estate agent Yopa, said: “The usual Christmas slowdown in the housing market has started early this year, as people wait for the outcome of the current political turmoil before making long-term commitments, such as buying a new home.”Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former residential chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: “Looking forward, we don’t expect activity to change much, bearing in mind seasonal and political distractions. On the ground, lethargy is replacing energy.”Gary Barker, chief executive of proptech company Reapit, also predicted a continuation of the current subdued performance. “Transactions have been flat for the past three years, and caution is likely to remain whilst Brexit remains unfinished. Furthermore, if Brexit stalls, or more significant uncertainty over the government develops, it will be a painful road ahead,” he said. Mr Barker said that there could be room for optimism: “We are seeing house price reduction in some areas, which could make property more affordable and also boost the economy by increasing spending power and buying capacity. “If the Brexit deal passes through parliament, we could potentially see a much more confident market, resulting in more transactions, fewer withdrawals, and increased prices.”However, he added: “If the Bank of England’s forecast of a 30 per cent drop in house prices comes to fruition following a no-deal Brexit, the balance of the market will shift dramatically. “Although transactions may reduce significantly, with depressed prices discouraging sellers from listing their properties, low prices will put buyers back in control. First-time buyers, in particular, could benefit from slashed prices, giving them a leg-up onto the property ladder.”Additional reporting by newswiresShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The oil producing nations had been expected to agree to a reduction in production on Thursday at its meeting in Vienna. Reaching a deal proved difficult as sanctions-hit Iran refused to comply with the output cuts, despite the input of non-Opec member Russia.

However, a second day of talks led to an agreement, providing a boost to the price of Brent crude which rose to $63.25 by mid-afternoon on Friday. Qatar to quit Opec in 2019 amid angry dispute with Saudi ArabiaWhat is OPEC and why has Qatar left its ranks?Trump hits out at OPEC and says oil prices are artificially very highWhy Opec is caught between a rock and a hard placeBarani Krishnan, senior analyst at Investing, said it was natural that oil traders would react as positively to Opec’s decision to cut production as they did negatively “when the group seemed powerless to reduce even a barrel”. He added: “However, the market will also be watching for any signs of cheating by OPEC and punish the cartel accordingly.”Mr Krishnan said the bigger takeaway is “what the Saudi energy minister would possibly have on his mind as he leaves Vienna today a Russia that has become as powerful to Opec as Riyadh and a US that is now a net exporter of oil”.Furthermore, we\u0027ve not even gotten to the Khashoggi fallout and likely Trump dismay over these cuts,” he added. “One can only speculate at this point to how this will play out for the Saudis and their oil business going forward.Donald Trump had called on Opec to leave production unfettered in order to weigh prices down, tweeting ahead of the Vienna meeting: “The world does not want to see… higher oil prices”. Meanwhile, Ashley Kelty, oil \u0026amp gas research analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, said that although cutting output by 1.2 million barrels per day was a larger reduction than some had expected, it was still short of “what is really required to bring the market back into balance”. She said: “Our initial snap judgement is that prices will stabilise in the $60-65 per barrel range, as the cuts are likely to be insufficient to stem the near term supply glut, given US output is continuing to \u0026nbsprise (albeit at a slower pace due to capacity constraints).“It feels like a bit of a fudge, and the absence of the final communique at this late stage suggests that a lot of horse trading has been underway to reach a situation that tries to appeal to all parties, whilst ending up with a situation that will appease no-one.”Earlier this week, Qatar quit Opec, however, it still attended the meeting in Vienna.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation.

Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time.

Property prices in the three months from September to November fell 1.1 per cent compared with the preceding quarter, while prices dropped 1.4 per cent between October and November. Meanwhile, the rate of growth dropped to 0.3 per cent, the lowest rate since December 2012. Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, said: “High employment, wage growth and historically low mortgage rates continue to make home ownership more affordable for many, though the need to raise a significant deposit still acts as something of a restraint on the market.

Mike Scott, chief property analyst at estate agent Yopa, said: “The usual Christmas slowdown in the housing market has started early this year, as people wait for the outcome of the current political turmoil before making long-term commitments, such as buying a new home.”Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former residential chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: “Looking forward, we don’t expect activity to change much, bearing in mind seasonal and political distractions. On the ground, lethargy is replacing energy.”Gary Barker, chief executive of proptech company Reapit, also predicted a continuation of the current subdued performance. “Transactions have been flat for the past three years, and caution is likely to remain whilst Brexit remains unfinished. Furthermore, if Brexit stalls, or more significant uncertainty over the government develops, it will be a painful road ahead,” he said. Mr Barker said that there could be room for optimism: “We are seeing house price reduction in some areas, which could make property more affordable and also boost the economy by increasing spending power and buying capacity. “If the Brexit deal passes through parliament, we could potentially see a much more confident market, resulting in more transactions, fewer withdrawals, and increased prices.”However, he added: “If the Bank of England’s forecast of a 30 per cent drop in house prices comes to fruition following a no-deal Brexit, the balance of the market will shift dramatically. “Although transactions may reduce significantly, with depressed prices discouraging sellers from listing their properties, low prices will put buyers back in control. First-time buyers, in particular, could benefit from slashed prices, giving them a leg-up onto the property ladder.”Additional reporting by newswiresShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  The site finds out which of your posts received the most likes, assembling them into a collage of nine pictures. You can then opt to share it to your Instagram – or do whatever else you like, such as sending it directly to your friends or uploading it to your story.Instagram finally lets people choose who sees storiesThe feature might take a while to compile your picture and so asks for an email address so that it can notify you of when your best nine is ready. While its privacy policy allows it to use that email for marketing, it does allow you to opt out – but if you\u0027re anxious about it, it might be worth quickly setting up a disposable email account just to make sure your address stays safe.That website – unlike some other, more questionable tools – doesn\u0027t require that you give it your login or the ability to access your account, since all the data that it needs to make the collage is public anyway. Since there are safe tools like that around, make sure not to use one that requires you to give any account information at all, since it is unnecessary and can put you at risk of having your profile used maliciously or even hacked.But for the same reason, the tool will only work for public profiles. Since it works by scraping the information from your profile, if you\u0027ve locked it down you won\u0027t be able to see the results.One option is simply to switch very quickly to a public profile, make your collage, and then switch back. As long as you do it quickly then it is unlikely anyone will notice.Another option is to make your own best nine, by picking through your photos and then arranging them into a collage using Instagram\u0027s own Layout app. That has the advantage of allowing you to choose any photos you wish you were included but aren\u0027t – but the downside of having to pick manually through what might be hundreds of photos.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO240 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film.

But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO740 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO940 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1540 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth.

PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2740 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2840 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2940 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3340 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3440 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. 140 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO240 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film.

And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO740 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO940 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1540 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth.

Hart had previously made a series of jokes that were deemed homophobic, including Tweets posted between 2009-11 which have since been deleted.

Keep in mind, I’m not homophobic, I have nothing against gay people, be happy. Do what you want to do. But me, being a heterosexual male, if I can prevent my son from being gay, I will. Now with that being said, I don’t know if I handled my son’s first gay moment correctly.

He said he was almost 40 years old and was “in love with the man I’m becoming”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Alongside the tweet, Cannon wrote\u0026nbsp“And I f**king love Wreck-It Ralph,” a reference to Silverman\u0027s role as the\u0026nbspvoice of Vanellope in the animation.Finally, Cannon resurfaced a 2012 tweet from Amy Schumer reading, “Enjoy skyfall f***. I\u0027m bout to get knee deep in Helen Hunt #thesessions.” He added the message: I’m just saying... should we keep going?Hart stepped down from hosting the Oscars after refusing to apologise for resurfaced jokes in which he uses homophobic slurs.

Keep in mind, I’m not homophobic, I have nothing against gay people, be happy. Do what you want to do. But me, being a heterosexual male, if I can prevent my son from being gay, I will. Now with that being said, I don’t know if I handled my son’s first gay moment correctly.

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO240 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history.

But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO740 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO940 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1540 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2740 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2840 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2940 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3340 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3440 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. 140 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film.

Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2740 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2840 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2940 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3340 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3440 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. After walking away from the Oscars, Hart apologised to those people who may have been offended, saying: “I sincerely apologize to the LGBTQ community for my insensitive words from my past ... I\u0027m sorry that I hurt people. I am evolving and want to continue to do so.”\u0026nbspGLAAD\u0026nbspissued a statement on the incident, saying Hart shouldn’t have stepped down he should have stepped up.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Back then in 2000, she wasn’t yet one of the great icons of popular culture. All I knew about her was the publicity cliché of her being a single mother made good. It was the same tired story repeated constantly about her.\u0026nbspSo I ignored all that and started her journey at the beginning in the villages near Bristol where she grew up.I discovered she was childhood friends with the Potter family who had lived in the same street and I spoke to them about childhood dressing-up games and Jo Rowling’s vivid imagination. I remember Mrs Potter telling me that Jo always had a big aversion to spiders. It’s no surprise that spiders the size of carthorses feature in her books.Six male celebrities changing the conversation around masculinityIt’s a bit like playing detective but you’re not investigating a crime. Start at the beginning and follow the journey imagine you are celebrating a life and chat to those who have known, liked or loved the famous person you are writing about.I moved on to Oporto in Portugal where Jo taught English as a foreign language to local students. I met her best Portuguese friend who worked with her at the school. She invited me to a family party at a restaurant where all these delicious dishes kept on appearing throughout the night the children ran around playing games and we drank wine and talked. It was a perfect evening. She told me the story of how she helped Jo extricate herself from her unhappy first marriage to a local man and return hastily to the UK with her young daughter. She also told me at the time she thought Jo was a nervous person, anxious and flitting around like a butterfly.Rowling\u0026nbspto Oporto in Portugal, where she was married to a local man and teaching English as a foreign language (AFPGetty)Through the eyes of the people I spoke to, I was able to build a picture of a real person – not one created by a publicity department. People like to talk if given the chance. I realised that when I was responsible for reporting golden and diamond wedding anniversaries on a weekly newspaper. That may sound boring but I loved it – the chance to hear about people’s lives while having a cup of tea and piece of homemade fruit cake. But you can’t pretend to be interested. That’s impossible to fake. My philosophy is simple: the most disrespectful thing you can do to another person is to have no interest in them.\u0026nbspWe live in an online world where the art of proper conversation is disappearing. In my job, if you turn off the phone and laptop and talk to people, things happen.The lesson I learned very early on in my career is that everyone deserves your time and attention. We live in an online world where the art of proper conversation is disappearing. In my job, if you turn off the phone and laptop and talk to people, things happen. If you follow the footsteps of your subject, you make connections. You get insight and you get lucky.I stopped off to buy a sandwich and a beer at the grocery store in Laurel Canyon, the Bohemian area of Los Angeles where Jennifer Aniston used to live when she was a struggling actress. I asked the guy on the till if he had ever come across her. ‘She used to work here,’ he said and proceeded to tell me all about it. He made me laugh because he wasn’t so impressed with Jennifer, who, after all, was still a shop assistant in his eyes. But his eyes lit up when he told me that Sophia Loren had once been in his store.I met with Jennifer’s school drama teacher Anthony Abeson in New York and went along to one of his classes. He had great enthusiasm for Jennifer as an actress. He told me about the time at the Fame School where his pupils had to prepare a scene for performance in front of class and she chose a particularly difficult one from The Three Sisters by Chekhov. It was meant to be very dramatic but everyone laughed. She was mortified. Afterwards, Anthony took her aside and told her she had a wonderful gift and it was marvellous that she had this ability to amuse. His words were life changing for her.\u0026nbspI was in McComb, Mississippi, which is where Britney Spears went to school. I was given an address for her first boyfriend about 10\u0026nbspmiles out of town so I drove out but there was no one there. There were no other houses. Nothing –\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspdead end. As I was leaving, a car pulled up. It was his mother, who was a charming woman. She\u0026nbspinvited me into her amazing mansion for coffee. She was a very accomplished painter and showed me her work. She rang up her son and he agreed to speak to me.He was great company and took me to a barbecue in the Mississippi woods. We chatted and drank beer and threw golf balls into the woods for his dog to fetch. He told me he once took Britney turkey hunting but she had to give up when she was bitten to hell by mosquitoes. This is a long way from Las Vegas and when night falls you can hear the coyotes – it’s a scary place. Britney didn’t like the nights in the woods and would get upset and have to be taken home. I don’t blame her.One of the myths about Britney is that she is some sort of trailer trash from the Deep South. This is nonsense. She went to a private school, where, incidentally, she was taught creationismOne of the myths about Britney is that she is some sort of trailer trash from the Deep South. This is nonsense. She went to a private school, where, incidentally, she was taught creationism. She had private dancing lessons. Her teenage boyfriend’s house had an elevator between floors. Money was tight when her dad’s building firm collapsed but she was brought up as a nice little girl. I remember speaking to her teacher at the Disney School in Orlando, Florida, when she was under contract to Disney. He told me that she was ‘the most wholesome, huggable little girl that you would ever want to see’. This is the real Britney Spears.\u0026nbspBritney used to date Justin Timberlake, who I also wrote about. I flew into Memphis, where I thought he was from, only to discover he was actually brought up 20\u0026nbspmiles away in the comfortable middle-class community of Shelby Forest, on the outskirts of the town of Millington.\u0026nbspOn my first day there I went into the local Millington library and asked loudly, ‘Does anyone here know Justin Timberlake?’ A woman piped up:\u0026nbsp‘My daughter was in his class at school.’ She put me in touch with her daughter and we had a lovely lunch and she told me about growing up in Shelby Forest.Apparently Justin was a Maths geek at school and was in the algebra club. She also recalled the school’s Christmas concert when the power failed. The enormous school gym was packed with bewildered parents and children sitting in complete darkness. Suddenly a voice launched forth from the gloom. It was Justin, aged 11, singing ‘O Holy Night’, unaccompanied. My lunch companion remembered, ‘The whole gym was in tears.’The most interesting thing about Rob, however, was learning that he\u0026nbspwasn’t entirely Jack the Lad. \u0026nbspHe\u0026nbsppreferred to take part in\u0026nbsppanto\u0026nbspthan kick a ball around in the parkI also had lunch with Justin’s delightful first girlfriend, who was looking forward to her wedding to a local doctor. She told me about the time she and Justin had decided to make love for the first time. They needed to buy condoms but that was tricky because Justin’s stepmum was the local pharmacist. In the end they had to catch the bus into Memphis to purchase a pack of three. Danielle’s pet name for Justin was ‘Stud Muffin’, a dream nickname for any teenage boy.\u0026nbspI love being able to share interesting new things about people we admire and care about. Take Robbie Williams for example. I had a great time in Stoke on Trent drinking with his old school buddies. They called him Rob – he wasn’t Robbie until Take That’s manager decided to call him that for his image. Rob and his friends were rascals. They used to ring up random numbers and tell jokes on the answer machine until the tape ran out.\u0026nbspThe most interesting thing about Rob, however, was learning that he wasn’t entirely Jack the Lad. He was a\u0026nbsprather a sensitive boy and a highly talented one who preferred to take part in panto than kick a ball around in the park. His father, a professional comedian, left home when he was a youngster and it had a profound effect on him.Why some people don\u0027t celebrate ThanksgivingAutistic boy writes letter to Anne Hegerty calling her an inspirationYoung people more inspired by grandparents than celebrities, pollI learnt much of his true nature from a wonderful woman called Zoe who was his closest friend in amateur dramatics for 10\u0026nbspyears. They were inseparable. They were in Chittty Chitty Bang Bang, Annie, Pickwick and Oliver together. In Oliver he was the Artful Dodger. On the opening night, Zoe knew something was wrong. He was singing ‘Consider Yourself’ and he just wasn’t himself. Off stage she could see he was upset, so put her arm around him and asked him what was wrong. He told her:\u0026nbsp‘I just started my first lines and I look up and there is my effing old man in the front row.’ He started crying but he went back out and gave the performance of his young life for his Dad.\u0026nbspI really warmed to Robbie. \u0026nbspI don’t write about celebrities. It’s a meaningless word these days, isn’t it? Celebrity used to mean something when we idolised proper stars such as\u0026nbspMarilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn or Elvis.\u0026nbsp Now, everybody is a celebrity who has been on television for two seconds. I write about the most famous people in the world: Adele, Cheryl, Kate Middleton and my latest subject, Ed Sheeran.But, more than that, I write about real people. When I was looking at the amazing life of Adele, I went into the flower shop in South London where she used to buy flowers for her mum and the young assistant in there said to me:\u0026nbsp‘I love Adele. She keeps it real.’\u0026nbspGeorge Michael, who I wrote about following his very sad death, is an example of someone who the world\u0026nbspdidn’t really know during his lifetime. He was poorly treated by the media while he was alive. He turned out to be a thoroughly decent man, a good man. But he\u0026nbspwasn’t George Michael until he was 18. He was\u0026nbspGeorgios Panayiotou, a Greek Cypriot boy.I interviewed his girlfriends from school and they were so warm about him. It was a joy. first girlfriend told me the story of how at her 16th birthday party, Yog, as she called him, turned up at her parents’ house with Andy – Andrew Ridgeley. It was a great night and later in the evening she looked out of the window into the garden to see the two future superstars of Wham! peeing into the fishpond.Ed Sheeran by Sean Smith is published by HarperCollins and is out now.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

We work hard to ensure that our customers can limit the impact and restore their services as soon as possible.”Ericsson says O2 data will be coming back ‘as soon as possible’The company said most of its affected customers had got back online, but that some – presumably including Tesco – were still not working, and that it was continuing to work with them.On Thursday evening, O2’s\u0026nbspchief executive said\u0026nbsphe was “sorry because we have let our customers down”.\u0026nbspMark Evans told Sky News restoration of the network had started and it would be completed by Friday morning.\u0026nbspPressed\u0026nbspby Sky News host\u0026nbspDermot Murnaghan\u0026nbspif the company would compensate customers, Mr Evans would only say it would “find a way of making an apology in an O2 way”.\u0026nbspMr Evans admitted, however,\u0026nbsphe did “not know yet” what “an O2 way” meant.The problems with the service provide\u0026nbsphave hit as many as 30 million people in the UK, affecting not only O2 customers but users of the networks that borrow their infrastructure, such as Tesco\u0026nbspMobile and GiffGaff.It also hit transport networks and other systems that rely on O2’s\u0026nbspinternet connections to transfer data.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It still appears to be affecting every customer\u0026nbspof O2.As well as the network\u0027s own users, customers of other carriers that rely on O2 – such as Tesco\u0026nbspMobile and GiffGaff\u0026nbsp– are also unable to get online.O2 said the problem was affecting only internet\u0026nbspconnections, and some texts. But many customers said they have no signal at all, and calls are not getting through either.The problems have also hit systems that seem entirely unrelated, such as live updating bus arrivals boards, which rely on O2\u0027s\u0026nbspdata network to report where they are.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The oil producing nations had been expected to agree to a reduction in production on Thursday at its meeting in Vienna. Reaching a deal proved difficult as sanctions-hit Iran refused to comply with the output cuts, despite the input of non-Opec member Russia. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe stalemate led the oil price to fall - the commodity had previously dropped by 30 per cent from four-year highs of more than $86 per barrel in October to below $59 at the end of November. However, a second day of talks led to an agreement, providing a boost to the price of Brent crude which rose to $63.25 by mid-afternoon on Friday. Qatar to quit Opec in 2019 amid angry dispute with Saudi ArabiaWhat is OPEC and why has Qatar left its ranks?Trump hits out at OPEC and says oil prices are artificially very highWhy Opec is caught between a rock and a hard placeBarani Krishnan, senior analyst at Investing, said it was natural that oil traders would react as positively to Opec’s decision to cut production as they did negatively “when the group seemed powerless to reduce even a barrel”. He added: “However, the market will also be watching for any signs of cheating by OPEC and punish the cartel accordingly.”Mr Krishnan said the bigger takeaway is “what the Saudi energy minister would possibly have on his mind as he leaves Vienna today a Russia that has become as powerful to Opec as Riyadh and a US that is now a net exporter of oil”.Furthermore, we\u0027ve not even gotten to the Khashoggi fallout and likely Trump dismay over these cuts,” he added. “One can only speculate at this point to how this will play out for the Saudis and their oil business going forward.Donald Trump had called on Opec to leave production unfettered in order to weigh prices down, tweeting ahead of the Vienna meeting: “The world does not want to see… higher oil prices”. Meanwhile, Ashley Kelty, oil \u0026amp gas research analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, said that although cutting output by 1.2 million barrels per day was a larger reduction than some had expected, it was still short of “what is really required to bring the market back into balance”. She said: “Our initial snap judgement is that prices will stabilise in the $60-65 per barrel range, as the cuts are likely to be insufficient to stem the near term supply glut, given US output is continuing to \u0026nbsprise (albeit at a slower pace due to capacity constraints).“It feels like a bit of a fudge, and the absence of the final communique at this late stage suggests that a lot of horse trading has been underway to reach a situation that tries to appeal to all parties, whilst ending up with a situation that will appease no-one.”Earlier this week, Qatar quit Opec, however, it still attended the meeting in Vienna.

However, Murphy was previously meant to host the awards show in 2012, before dropping out over their treatment of\u0026nbspBrett Ratner, who at the time was under fire for making a homophobic tweet. Whether the comedian will actually take the offer is another question altogether. Saturday Night Live star\u0027s appearance at last year\u0027s ceremony proved to be one of its highlights, as she teamed up with Tiffany Haddish to announce the awards for Best Documentary and Best Live-Action Short. What Rudolph brings to the table is variety. In short, she can (basically) do it all: cutting asides, goofiness, song-and-dance numbers, and Old Hollywood charm.\u0026nbspGet Out.

Plus, she\u0027s a razor-sharp talent that would add a much-needed edge to the ceremony and would ensure the three-hour telecast doesn\u0027t lose an ounce of energy.\u0026nbspMary Poppins\u0026nbspReturns.

Whether the UK had this power or not has been disputed, and campaigners had asked judges to rule.This isn’t a final legal ruling by the court, but judges usually endorse what the advocate general suggests. We should find out if this recommendation is confirmed within the coming weeks, with 17 December one date that is being talked about in Brussels.\u0026nbspIf it is confirmed, an accidental no-deal Brexit is effectively taken off the table – the government would be able to stop it in all circumstances if it wanted to.\u0026nbspThis is significant because the government’s main argument to remainer MPs to get them to support Theresa May’s deal has been that if they don’t, a disastrous no-deal Brexit could happen without anyone wanting it to. In one respect, the decision makes it harder for May’s deal to pass, because she won\u0027t be able to scare them into backing it.Meanwhile, in WestminsterAs the news from the Luxembourg court broke in the morning , MPs were settling in for a big day in Westminster. By the time they went home for the night, the Government had been defeated in three votes – a record bad day for Theresa May’s minority administration.One of these votes was about whether the Government was in contempt of parliament for refusing to release its legal advice about its Brexit deal. MPs decided that ministers were indeed in contempt – effectively forcing the government to release the legal advice. This is significant because the advice is expected to provide more ammunition for opponents of the deal, especially Brexiteers.But another vote lost by the government will likely have even bigger implications. MPs – including 26 Tory rebels – voted to give parliament more power if Theresa May’s deal is voted down.If the deal is voted down next Tuesday the Government has 21 days to come back to Parliament and lay its plan for what happens next. But under the successful amendment tabled by Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve, the Commons will also be able to vote on what it wants the Government to do. Though that vote wouldn’t technically be binding, it would be politically incredible for the Government to ignore it.\u0026nbspTaken together with the likely ECJ ruling that the UK has the power to stop Brexit if it wants, MPs would be expected to take no-deal off the table. They might also call for a so-called ‘plan B’ – a call for Theresa May to go back to Brussels and negotiate a different deal. Whether that would be successful is another matter.So what are the implications for Brexit?The overall effect of the events of Tuesday 4 December are to make a no-deal Brexit significantly less likely. Nobody thinks there is a majority of MPs in favour of a no-deal, and they will now control the Government’s response to its deal being defeated.\u0026nbspIf the ECJ decides that the UK does have the unilateral power to revoke Brexit, then no-deal is effectively off the table. But even if it doesn’t it’s unlikely member states would stand in the way and push Britain off the cliff.In one sense, the deal is also less likely to pass because of what happened: Remainers were being encouraged to vote for it on the basis that a no-deal might happen.\u0026nbspBut in a strange way, the deal might win more support – if Brexiteers decide that the defeat of the deal might mean Brexit not happening at all, they could swing behind it. A large number have already publicly said they will vote against it, however – so whether that will be enough remains to be seen.Is that everything that happened?No, that’s just the main thread.

But at the moment I’m looking at who is in the papers, who can we get behind, but it shouldn’t be about the personality it should be about the country.”\u0026nbspMs McVey\u0026nbspsaid she would support the prime minister if she were to go back to Brussels and try and renegotiate the deal, in particular around the Irish backstop and the £39bn ‘orce bill’ that Ms May’s withdrawal agreement accounts for.Mr Raab was interviewed on the same show, and asked if he would rule out a run, he said: “I’ve always said I wouldn’t rule it out, but I’m just not going to get sucked in to that debate.“The public and people watching this show would think it would be very self-indulgent to be engaging in that speculation.”He would not comment when asked if he would stand aside for fellow Brexiteer Boris Johnson to run for the leadership.It\u0026nbspcame as comments the government was hit by another resignation over the Brexit plan –\u0026nbspWill Quince, a ministerial aide to defence secretary Gavin Williamson.He hit out at the backstop plan to avoid a hard border with Ireland, saying it could result in the UK being “tied to the negotiating table for years, until we agree to anything in desperation” to get out of the situation.For her part, Ms May warned Tory MPs they risk handing Jeremy Corbyn the keys to Number 10 unless they back her Brexit deal in an interview with Mail on Sunday, .“It would mean grave uncertainty for the nation with a very real risk of no Brexit or leaving the European Union with no deal,” she told the Mail on Sunday.“We have a leader of the Opposition who thinks of nothing but attempting to bring about a general election, no matter what the cost to the country.“As someone who cares passionately about my country and my party, I believe Jeremy Corbyn getting his hands on power is a risk we cannot afford to take.”Reports suggested Ms May could make an emergency trip to Brussels ahead of a planned summit on Thursday in an effort to secure further concessions in an effort to win over critics of her plan.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The key issue that we’re\u0026nbspsaying\u0026nbsptoday, and that’s why we’re delivering a petition signed by a million people in this country, is that those choices are ones that should be made by the British people.“Parliament is gridlocked ... This is no way to decide the most fundamental question facing Britain for the next 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years.“It is time that we now put the clear choices to the British people and allow them to decide.”Thornberry contradicts Jeremy Corbyn and insists Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumThe two documents were handed in to officials at 11am by Ms Greening, politicians from three other parties and The Independent‘s editor Christian Broughton.\u0026nbspLabour’s\u0026nbspChuka Umunna, a champion of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “The biggest issue that we’ve had since the Second World War is being left to MPs. And the problem we have with MPs\u0026nbspin parliament, is\u0026nbspthat they can’t come to a view of what should happen in this situation.“The bottom line is how else are you going to resolve impasse in Westminster if not by referring it back to the people. I don’t know anyone who has come up with a viable alternative.”\u0026nbspLiberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the “let’s-just-get-on-with-it”\u0026nbspattitude is a “fallacy”, because “even if we accept the government’s deal we’re not just getting on with it”.“We’ll be spending years in negotiation of what kind of arrangement we’d want with the European Union – the problem isn’t going to go away,” he said.The prime minister has repeatedly said that she will not countenance a further referendum on Brexit. But with no option carrying a majority in the Commons, a new vote has become\u0026nbspa more likely way to break the political deadlock.\u0026nbspReferring to calls for a new referendum on Monday, Ms May said: “People are talking about a second vote when we haven’t even delivered on the first vote.“I think we need to deliver on the first vote. We asked people to vote. We said ‘please decide whether we should leave or remain’.“People voted to leave and I think there’s a, sort of, democratic duty on us as politicians, having had that referendum, and having said it is your choice, to actually deliver on it. So, let’s deliver on the first vote.”Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

In recent days she has outlined how her proposals will deliver on the\u0026nbsppublic’s desire to end EU free movement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Both need (or needed in the recent past) the complete removal of the original tropical forest.”Based on forest loss trends, if governments do not act immediately and end acceptance of certification schemes, the world will almost completely lose southeast Asian forests in a few decades, he warned.\u0026nbsp“Our research shows quite unequivocally that, unfortunately, there is no way to produce sustainable palm oil that did not come from deforestation, and that the claims by corporations, certification schemes and non government organisations are simply ‘greenwashing’, useful to continue business as usual,” he\u0026nbspadded. “No shortcuts: if you use palm oil, certified or not, you are definitely destroying tropical forests.”Claims by corporations, certification schemes and\u0026nbspNGOs\u0026nbspare simply ‘greenwashing’, useful to continue business as usualForest loss was continuous everywhere where there was a palm oil plantation, even if certified as sustainable.“Every tropical tree, which is part of a complex tropical forest, harbours thousands of other species – insects, birds, reptiles, amphibians, birds, monkeys, primates such as orangutans, ferns, mosses – and every time a tropical tree is cut to make room for a plantation a whole community, often including very rare species, may disappear.\u0026nbspHe accused those who say certified plantations are sustainable of hiding the evidence.According to the study, which was published in the\u0026nbspScience of the Total Environment\u0026nbspjournal,\u0026nbspthere is a trick to “certification”: first, an old-growth tropical forest is cut (or slashed-and-burned) for paper and pulp or valuable tropical timber trades then a traditional, non-certified palm oil plantation is started after a certain time the traditional plantation is “transformed” into a certified one and wins a sustainability label.We do not have any means to stop southeast Asian deforestation due to palm oil with labels and certification schemes“The trick is that they make leverage on the absence of historical records on land use change, hiding the reality that even a certified concession was, in the recent past, a highly bioerse tropical forest,” Prof Gatti said.His team said they also found a pattern in which deforestation slows when organisations such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil form, but a few years later, the forest loss speeds back up. “This can be also due to the more recent establishment of new ‘sustainable plantations’ and the need to cut new forests to fuel the increasing global market,” according to the researchers.The report says areas in which forest loss was detected and those of both traditional and certified plantations almost exactly overlap, so any land that is certified today was a “valuable and bioerse” forest in the recent past.Created with Sketch.10 photographs to show to anyone who doesn\u0027t believe in climate change Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A group of emperor penguins face a crack in the sea ice, near McMurdo Station, AntarcticaAmid a flood in Islampur, Jamalpur, Bangladesh, a woman on a raft searches for somewhere dry to take shelter.

If this is true, my question is why palm oil has to be considered an essential livelihood for humanity.“The problem escalated in the last 15 years and there is no need for a globalised production of this cheap oil in unnecessary products. If the conservation of tropical forest is a priority of our society, then there is no way to produce palm oil for the world market as we show in our research.\u0026nbspTropical forests have an inner value, independently of the economy of their production.”He urged a combination of a more localised use of oils, cutting fatty and unhealthy snack foods such as those containing palm oil, bans on importing palm oil by the EU, US, China and India and the use of more sustainable oils.\u0026nbspThe professor said he believed that claims that the industry provides swathes of jobs were weak because the multinationals’ contracts with mills in southeast Asia were temporary, short-term ones.“Quite often whole families (including children) work in the plantations, without any respect of human and children’s rights, in very unhealthy conditions (covered by sprayed pesticides, for instance).”The Independent has asked the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil to comment.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Salary and expense data posted in spreadsheets on the website of Albania’s Ministry of Finance show a wealth of details about the State Intelligence Service, including the locations of field offices, cash withdrawals, and minutiae such as the plumbers, technicians and mechanics they use. The records show the names and national identification card numbers of agents in the service, known locally and in the intelligence community as SHISH, operating inside Albania and abroad, including two with sensitive posts at Nato headquarters in Brussels.\u0026nbspThe spreadsheets disclose the names, positions, salaries and expenses of at least eight senior clandestine Albanian operatives – some working under diplomatic cover – in Belgium, Greece, Kosovo, Italy, Macedonia and Serbia.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe Independent is not disclosing names or other identifying details to prevent retribution against low-level informants or others who may be associated with the agency’s operatives. Presented with the breach during a meeting in a café outside the agency’s heavily fortified Tirana compound, SHISH officials acknowledged the sensitive nature of the information.“The principle is that everything our agency does should be hidden, but we should follow all these rules and regulations,” said one SHISH official. “The rules and regulations don’t allow us to spend the money without reporting it.”Intelligence and security professionals told about the breach were stunned by the revelations, which could leave agents in sensitive positions vulnerable to surveillance or blackmail by hostile intelligence organisations or criminals seeking to infiltrate the Western alliance. “By getting into Albania’s system they can get into Nato’s system,” said Xhemal Gjunkshi, an opposition member of the Albanian parliament who serves on the National Security Commission and was a former Major-General in the army.\u0026nbsp“You start pulling a string and you end up in Brussels or London or the office of a supreme allied commander in the US.”Helidon Bendo, director of Albania’s State Intelligence Service, or SHISH\u0026nbsp(SHISH)A former CIA field operative familiar with SHISH described it as the type of bureaucratic catastrophe that could put lives at risk. “Your admin can screw you up if they’re not paying attention,” he told The Independent on condition of anonymity because he continues to work on sensitive security matters. “You can put the budget online. But to put the names and the other details of agents – that’s insanity.”A Brussels-based spokesperson for Nato said in an email that it does not comment on intelligence matters.Sigurimi, Albania’s Communist-era domestic spy service, at The House of Lives, a former intelligence headquarters now a museum in Tirana\u0026nbsp(Borzou Daragahi)SHISH is the successor organisation to the much feared Sigurimi, the notorious Communist-era domestic spy service that infiltrated every aspect of Albanians’ personal lives during the country’s four-and-a-half decade Stalinesque dictatorship. A 2007 US State Department cable published by Wikileaks described SHISH as “a professional, largely apolitical intelligence service” that is “excellent partners” with the US government and cited “close cooperation on all intelligence activities”.The director of the organisation, currently Helidon Bendo, is appointed by the prime minister but it operates as an autonomous unit outside of the Albanian cabinet. According to the finance ministry documents, it employs 913 people. One foreign diplomat complained that SHISH operates with little accountability or oversight. The documents revealed tantalising clues about the operations of the clandestine agency. The Independent could not confirm whether the names of the operatives inside Albania were handles or birth names. But the names of the international operatives listed matched the identities of Albanian diplomatic staff posted at embassies across Europe.One female regional operative in the main port city of Durrës, whose name and ID card number are visible in the records, is listed as withdrawing the Albanian currency equivalent\u0026nbspof\u0026nbsp£18,000, over at least 10 transactions this year for “special payments”, a possible reference to networks of informants.Another agent in Gjirokastër, in Albania’s south, is recorded withdrawing a cheque for about £1,500 in November for what is described on the Albanian ministry of finance’s public website as a “secret fund”. One set of 2017 payments, classified as secret, refers to a Nato communications system, referred to as Tumba, which might refer to several mountain peaks in the Balkans.At one point, water bills in Albania’s Himara district, where many members of the country’s Greek minority reside, suddenly drop 95 per cent, suggesting shifting surveillance priorities. The information appeared to be updated daily. A withdrawal of about £21,000\u0026nbspfrom Credins Bank in Tirana on 3 December was posted online by day’s end. Details include the licence plate numbers and sometimes make and model details of vehicles used by the spies, and even where the cars are taken for repairs, as well as records of pricey hotel stays and restaurant bills.Officials vowed to remove the data after The Independent informed the country’s prime ministry, intelligence services, foreign ministry, interior ministry, defence ministry and finance ministry publication of this article was pending. During the months the information has been online, it likely left the Nato country vulnerable to infiltration by operatives of Russian or other intelligence agencies. The country has already become something of a battleground as dominant pro-Western political leaders fend off the Kremlin’s agenda of weakening its Nato and EU ties. In March, Albania expelled two Russian diplomats, accusing them of unauthorised intelligence operations. “Their work did not correspond to their diplomatic status,” the foreign minister Ditmir Bushati said at the time.Albania appears to have repeatedly suffered from a lack of information security when it comes to its intelligence services. Last year the presidency\u0026nbspposted online an unredacted copy of SHISH director Mr Bendo’s national identification card, which includes his home address and ID number, as part of a transparency initiative.Earlier this year, a state agency reportedly was sent a list of 250 or so names of operatives serving in the country’s Military Intelligence unit. The SHISH documents posted online date back to 2014, as Albania struggled to show the EU that it had shaken off its history of public corruption and was seeking to be more transparent and accountable as a step towards membership in the trading and currency bloc.Albanian laws forbids the leaking of secret state information, with penalties of up to 10 years in prison for officials who ulge the intelligence and five years for ordinary citizens. Told of the leaks, officials of the prime minister’s office, finance ministry, interior ministry, and foreign ministry scrambled behind the scenes to remove the data, but also assign blame for the mishap. “The treasury registers on its online system all the bills and order of payments that are executed each day,” one official said on condition of anonymity. “All the details that are given there, are because they were written in the order of payment by the institution itself. They should have not detailed the bills with such sensitive information.”One longtime former officer of the Albanian intelligence service told The Independent that the culpability lay with SHISH itself, for handing sensitive information to finance ministry officials who lack security clearances.“It’s incompetence of the leadership,” said the former official, who spoke on condition he not be named discussing sensitive political issues. “Sometimes people are hired not because of good performance or qualifications, but because of the influence of the politicians. Sometimes people coming into the security institutions aren’t well vetted. The problem starts at the top.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Architect Stefano Boeri\u0027s striking Vertical Forest residential towers, completed in 2014 near the Garibaldi train station, aims to improve not only air quality but the quality of life for Milan residents.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialMr Boeri created a small island of greenery in the heart of Milan, his pair of high-rises brimming from every balcony with shrubs and trees that absorb carbon dioxide and PM10 particles, a pollutant with links to respiratory ailments and cancer.What are the Paris climate agreement and the COP24 summit?I think the theme of forestation is one of the big challenges that we have today. It is one of the most effective ways we have to fight climate change, because it is like fighting the enemy on its own field, Mr Boeri said. It is effective and it is also democratic, because everyone can plant trees.The UN climate summit taking place now in Poland has urged cities and regions to help achieve the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement on curbing global warming, which include limiting the increase in the planet\u0027s temperature to 2C (3.6F) this century.Also, the World Economic Forum\u0027s global agenda council has put extending the tree canopy among its top urban initiatives, recognising that small-scale changes can have a major impact on urban areas, including helping to lower city temperatures, creating more comfortable microclimates and mitigating air pollution.Milan officials estimate the program to boost the number of trees by 30 per cent in the broader metropolitan area will absorb an additional 5 million tons of carbon dioxide a year – four-fifths of the total produced by Milan – and reduce harmful PM10 small particulates by 3,000 tons over a decade. Significantly, it would also reduce temperatures in the city by 2C, they say.Mr Boeri said the current green canopy of the Lombardy region\u0027s capital is just 7 per cent of the urban area. That is well below northern European cities like Germany\u0027s Frankfurt at 21.5 per cent or Amsterdam at nearly 21 per cent. It is closer to Paris at nearly 9 per cent, according to the World Economic Forum\u0027s Green View Index – and the French capital itself has been battling for years to fight rising air pollution.By 2030, Milan hopes to increase that green canopy number to between 17 and 20 per cent.Damiano Di Simine, the scientific coordinator in Lombardy for the environmental group Legambiente, said potentially the biggest impact of the green Milan project will be to lower temperatures in a city where the night-time temperature can be 6C (10.8F) higher than in the surrounding area. City statistics show Milan endures 35 tropical nights a year.Because the city lies close to the Alps, Milan gets very little wind to clear the pollutants that become blocked in by temperature inversions, where a layer of cool air is trapped by a layer of warmer air.\u0027\u0027The lack of wind also accentuates the urban heating, Mr Di Simine said. \u0027\u0027It means the discomfort from thermic inversions is terrible, because the climate is very stationary. Planting trees will help this.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protestors wearing yellow vests (gilets jaunes) clash with riot police near the Champs Elysees avenue in Paris during a protest against rising costs of living they blame on high taxes. - Paris was on high alert with major security measures in place ahead of fresh yellow vest protests which authorities fear could turn violent for a second weekend in a row.

What is the latest on the issue Fox hunting with dogs was banned in  amid complaints by animal welfare campaigners who argued it caused suffering to wild animals chased and killed by hounds.But the ban - which forbids the use of dogs to hunt foxes and other wild mammals in England and Wales - did not end traditional hunts.Many hunts now follow a scent trail instead of a fox, or work around loopholes in the law.And while hunting with foxes is banned - you can use dogs to flush out the fox so it can be caught by a bird of prey.While campaigning for the  General Election, May said she was in favour of hunting and a vote would allow Parliament the opportunity to take the decision on this.A leaked email from Benjamin Mancroft, master of the Foxhounds Association, said a Conservative landslide in the election could result in enough votes for a repeal of the ban.Mays predecessor David Cameron also promised Parliament a vote on the isive issue but never held one due to a lack of support.The Tories failed miserably in the  General Election and were unable to secure their predicted parliamentary majority.The Conservatives were therefore forced to axe some of their more controversial policies.The vote on repealing the fox hunting ban was among these, and was not mentioned in the Queen’s Speech.On July , the Government confirmed Theresa Mays free vote on fox hunting plan had been scrapped.Environment minister Therese Coffey said the Tory minority administration is not planning to bring forward a vote in “this session”.This suggests it will be a minimum of two years before such an idea is even considered, after the Prime Minister’s position was weakened after losing her House of Commons majority.In January  Mrs May confirmed that MPs won’t be offered a free vote on repealing the Hunting Act during this Parliament - but insisted she is still a supporter of hunts.The u-turn was seen as trying to win over the under-s and appear to make the Tories more “caring”.Asked on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show whether she supported the blood sport, she said: “I‘ve not changed my view on that.Butlook back at what the messages we got from the election, one of the clear messages we got was there were a number of areas in which people were concerned about what we were proposing.“So just as we’ve looked at issues on school funding, on tuition fees, on housing, and we’re taking forward approaches in relation to that, on this issue of fox-hunting, what I can say is there won’t be a vote during this parliament.”The issue still raises passions more than a decade after the practice was outlawed.Polls consistently suggest a majority of Brits oppose fox hunting.A survey in the run-up to the  election revealed  per cent of voters believes fox hunting should remain illegal.But many Conservative lawmakers represent rural areas where support is strongest.A petition to keep the ban was signed by nearly , people after Mrs Mays vote pledge.A Conservative Party vice-chairman also warned against re-opening the debate.Sir Roger Gale, a patron of Conservatives Against Fox Hunting, said MPs in the next parliament will have more than enough to occupy their time without considering yesterdays argument of repealing the Hunting Act."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000402655327-e1528307444665.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"what brexit backstop plan theresa may eu irish border latest","story":"Heres our guide to the plan and what it means for Northern Ireland and its border with the Republic of Ireland.The backstop plan is essentially a safety netthere is no Brexit trade deal.It would avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.The backstop will see Britain remain in the customs union for as long as necessary until an alternative way of keeping the border open is found.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , EU leaders approved an agreement on the UKs withdrawal from the EU.MPs will now be asked to approve the agreement when it comes before the House of Commons next week.Attorney General Geoffrey Cox has been ordered to publish all the legal advice hes given Mrs May on her proposed deal - but has only handed over a summary instead.It concluded the proposed backstop would stop Britain making trade deals around the world in a separate legal document.Addressing the issue of the backstop - which will keep Britain in the customs uniontheres no other way to protect the Irish border - the Attorney General said: There is no unilateral right for either party to terminate this arrangement.This means thatno superseding agreement can be reached within the implementation period, the protocol would be activated and in international law would subsist, evennegotiations had broken down.How likely that is to happen is a political question, to which the answer will no doubt depend partly on the extent to which it is in either partys interests to remain indefinitely within its arrangements.We are indefinitely committing to itit came into force. There is no point in the Government trying to hide that fact.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.At the start of a key debate in Parliament on her Brexit plan, the Prime Minister said the backstop was not a trap for Britain.The backstop is not a trick to trap us in the EU, said Mrs May.It actually gives us some important benefits of access to the EUs market without many of the obligations and that is something the EU will not want to let happen, let alone persist for a long time."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/nintchdbpict000312629742.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"universal credit application driving licence","story":"MP Dan Carden said hed heard of constituents being made to buy a form of ID before they can get access to benefits, but Amber Rudd blasted him for scaremongering.Mr Carden, the MP for Liverpool Walton, said in a letter to Amber Rudd: I have now been informed that job centres across Liverpool are advancing payments to my constituents to obtain provisional driving licences for the purposes of identication and then deducting the cost from their benefits.He said people in his area were being made to pay the postage and passport photos too - just to get a form of ID.And it could mean theres an even longer wait for benefits too, as the DVLA said there was a five week wait.It already takes five weeks to get the first payment through on Universal Credit, meaning struggling Brits could be wrongly told they have to wait TEN weeks to get help.Mr Carden urged the DWP Secretary to halt the rollout of Universal Credit in his area until the problems are fixed.He said: The Universal Credit system is not fit for purpose. The online system is riddled with faults, complications and delays.There can be no doubt, continuing with this roll-out will leave many of the most vulnerable families destitute by Christmas, and I am asking you to intervene as a matter of urgency.His area is currently seeing the full roll out of Universal Credit.But Amber Rudd blasted the letter as scaremongering.She said tonight: Theres no requirement for a UC claimant to have ID, butyou do purchase one we can actually reimburse you.Where people wont have ID our terric work coaches use many methods to identy someone and get their claim started right away.Many Brits have said they are finding the verication process online dficult - and hundreds of thousands of people have abandoned the online application because they couldnt finish it, recent figures revealed.Only half of claimants said they were able to make a claim online for benefits without help.IF youre experiencing trouble applying for your Universal Credit, or the payments just dont cover costs, here are your options:Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord.

Suddenly, every berk thinks that the phone in their hand gives them the right to publish anything they see.Either they have some gung-ho fantasy of being a war correspondent, responsible for recording a fracas without doing a damn thing about stopping it. Or  in their head they are suddenly Quentin ­Tarantino, recording a particularly tasty bit of violence.So we get incidents like last week’s, at a Towie-favourite nightclub in Gants Hill, North East ­London. A young woman was filmed being sexually assaulted as onlookers, some of them women, jeer at the “fun” and point cameras up her skirt.Were these people scared of intervening and pulling the thugs off her, and filming it in order to pass the footage on to club management and police  Nope, they just put it up on the internet for the world to share the jeering. The weird and wicked idea that this is somehow OK is growing.Incidents on planes, in clubs, in the street, in schoolyards, are filmed by bystanders who don’t even try to shout or intervene. They are then plonked online, just to get some strange kudos for the person filming it.From the US and, increasingly, here there are cases of onlookers recording the humiliation of other people, not responsibly and ethically in order to give it to the authorities — managements, police, teachers — but just to put it online and “go viral”.Take the coward who last month filmed a policewoman being violently kicked in the head, then posted the footage online with the caption “LOL.” Or the bully who posted a video of a drunk teen ­giving oral sex to more than  men in Magaluf, for the “banter”.And last week, a shocking video of a -year-old Syrian refugee boy called Jamal being dragged to the floor by his neck went viral. Then, because the poor boy has not been humiliated enough, his ordeal was shared online by “disgusted” celebs and MPs who proclaim to care but are, of course, unwittingly ­contributing to his suffering.Some may vaguely think they are activists exposing bad ­behaviour, but in cases like this they are no such thing. They are voyeurs, cowards, and exhibitionists. Because it’s the victim of the attack, not just the attackers, who gets humiliated.Anyone half-decent understands that only disgusting ­people go in for “revenge porn”, sharing intimate videos of someone they broke up with. Whether dumped or cheated on, that is a horrible thing to do and can make the victim suicidal. Young girls live in terror of it, on one hand encouraged to be sexy and on the other scared of having their most unguarded moments exposed to the world.It has, a few times, led to ­prosecution and so it should. But personal vengeance and associated “slut-shaming” is only part of it.The whole business of filming other people without consent needs to be seen for what it is — a form of unregulated, potentially irresponsible and damaging rogue journalism.  Smartphone tech and the internet should be ­governed by the same ethical rules journalism developed.Good editors pixelate faces and agonise about what is responsible reporting, and what is in the ­public interest.If it would be wrong for a news reporter to film, for no good ­reason, a person being humiliated, assaulted, or even just tumbling in the street or falling asleep in an embarrassing position on a train, then it is even more wrong for any selfish git with a smartphone to do it.Journalism has rules because it is public. Now that technology can make anyone’s instant shot just as public, the rules should be the same. And because the technology belongs to the “digital natives” who grew up with it, it is time they applied to it all those pious, ethical modern values which we hear so much about.Not all slut-shamers and gloating video bystanders are young — but a great many are. It’s the job of the new ­generation to invent and support a digital morality.What’s the point being a ­liberated, gay-friendly, vegan-conscious, no-ing snowflakeyou’re not willing to call out callous voyeurs and smartphone sneaks Libby Purves is a former presenter of Radio ’s Today programme.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But this lot beats them all.Two years ago we had a vote on whether we wanted to stay in the European Union. The outcome was decisive.By  per cent to  per cent we voted to leave. The people had been given a voice.And the people said very clearly: We want to leave.But there was never a majority among our political class for leaving.tp composite more brexitBecause for two years the Remainer majority of MPs has done everything it possibly can to thwart the will of the people.They have undermined Theresa May and the Government when it tried to negotiate with Brussels.That’s the main reason the deal we have before us now is so weak.Because as soon as ministers set off to do battle, the likes of Philip Hammond and Justine Greening would be trying to pull the rug from under their feet.The biggest deceit is this. All the while these politicians are trying to scupper Brexit, they are putting on their sincere faces and saying: “We must respect the will of the people.”This is a downright lie and it has always been a downright lie.When Tory Remainers tell you we must get a good deal, they really mean we must not leave the European Union.When the Labour Party tells you that we must have a “good Brexit for jobs”, they really mean that we must not leave the European Union.When that coffin-faced bore Dominic Grieve, once our Attorney General, puts down amendments which effectively stop us leaving with a no-deal, he is really saying: “We must not leave the European Union under any conditions at all.”When they start lecturing you about how Parliament must be sovereign — they’re saying the same thing. We must not leave the EU.What has happened over the past two years has been a concerted campaign of treachery and betrayal.The Tory Brexiteers — with one or two exceptions, such as David Davis, Priti Patel and Jacob Rees-Mogg — haven’t helped by being a disorganised rabble.Too interested in their own political careers to do the dficult work of leading Britain towards a confident exit from that authoritarian bureaucracy.But it is the Remainers who have done the real damage.If they didn’t tell us, at every step of the way, that “the people’s vote must be respected” then I’d have a little more time for them. But they trot that out every time they open their mouths.All the while trying to wreck any chance of Brexit.God knows what will happen now. Although I suspect even he’s perplexed.What should have been a graceful and confident exit from an unfit institution has turned into a bugger’s muddle.But I do know this. The people of the UK will not forget the names of those who have sold us down the river.And one day, sure enough, we’ll have our revenge.What’s advertised as a glistening winter wonderland is usually five square yards of mud with a plastic donkey and an elf who has just completed a five stretch for armed robbery.I know everybody needs to make a ­living. But I do wonder how the owners of these crap grottos live with themselves.Find eight of the best Winter Wonderlands here.WHAT a fabulous family the Osamors are.A real credit to the country, to the Labour Party and to the House of Commons.Let’s start with Kate, above, the Labour MP for Edmonton and one of Jeremy ­Corbyn’s favourites.She employed her son, Ishmael, below, as a researcher at the House of Commons.And continued to do so even after he had been convicted of possessing lethal drugs including ketamine and ecstasy at a festival.Not only that, but she misled the public and her colleagues.She said she hadn’t known about her son’s conviction until after he was sentenced.When it was absolutely clear that she had.How did she respond when a journalist tried to ask her about this business She screamed “f*** off” at him. Then threw a bucket of water at him.Then said: “I should have come down here with a bat and smashed your head in.”After which, this entitled madam actually rang  – twice – to say the reporter was “stalking” her.Unbelievable.Then there’s  Grandma Osamor, Kate’s mother Martha. Now ennobled as Baroness Osamor of Tottenham and taking her seat in the House of Lords at your expense.A supporter of Labour activists suspended over anti-Semitism.And once considered too left-wing even for the Labour Party, until Corbyn came along.What a great parenting job both she and her daughter have done.And do you suppose that either would be in the ­positions they are now were it not for the colour of their skin THE animal rights activists Peta want us to stop using  certain phrases which are nasty about animals.Such as, “No use flogging a dead horse”.Better to say: “You can’t feed a fed horse.” Which doesn’t sound right at all, to me.Some vegans are also supposedly  objecting to “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”, because it’s unkind to eggs. And “bringing home the bacon”. Which is unkind to bacon.I think we need to create a few new ones to annoy Peta even further. So . . .Too many voles in the blender spoil the smoothie.Riots, confusion, mayhem. They’ve just woken up to the fact that their president is a smirking liberal halfwit who cares not a jot about working-class people.  We could have told you that, mes amis, when you elected him  months ago.Emmanuel Macron has already had to climb down and give in to some of the demands from the rioters.During the election he portrayed himself as a populist, but was anything but. It was a con job.Next time you toddle off to the polls, you lot, get it right.SO, Nigel Farage has deserted Ukip because he thinks the party has become too extremist.Fair enough, he’s probably right. The party looks dead and buried.It’s a shame that because of our first-past-the-post system Ukip were never able to capture many seats in parliament.I’ve never been a fan of proportional representation.Butwe had it, Ukip under Farage, above, would likely be our second or third biggest party by now.And those negotiations over  Brexit would be looking very dferent, wouldn’t they RESPECT to Wrexham driver Kenneth Samuels. He managed to fit ELEVEN people into his Ford Focus.Actually, he’s a Wrexham non-driver now, because the Old Bill caught him.  He was disqualied from driving for  months.I assumed at first that he was ferrying a troupe of dwarves to a panto.But no. There were children involved, which kind of antagonised the magistrates.If the police had looked a bit further I suspect they’d have found the entire Liberal Democrat Party in the boot.  And Speaker John Bercow in the glove box. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Senior figures there say that will not be decided until Monday.But they do admit they are making little headway in trying to quell this rebellion, and that they are heading for a loss.How big  “I’m sure it’ll breach three figures”, one Cabinet minister says of the margin of defeat.A way to avoid such a humiliation would be to find an amendment that could pass the Commons.This means there would be no vote on May’s deal as it currently stands, enabling the Government to argue that it hadn’t actually been defeated.Though, as one source admits, voters would be left baffled by this procedural trick.This approach isn’t guaranteed to work either.First of all, it would rely on John Bercow selecting the amendment — which is far from certain. The Speaker is supposed to be impartial, but Bercow has long used his power to cause the Government trouble.Much of Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting was taken up with ministers complaining about him. Liam Fox, the Trade ­Secretary, called Bercow “a disgrace to his office”.Also, some Tory rebels are itching to defeat the Government. They are discussing whether to vote against ALL amendments, regardless of whether they agree with them or not, so they can make clear their opposition to May’s deal. Some in Cabinet think thatMPs voted for an amendment setting out what would make the deal acceptable to Parliament, it would strengthen May’s hand with the EU.One tells me: “The negotiation has been all about us saying yes or no. This would make the EU say yes or no to something.”Chancellor Philip Hammond, though, argued at Thursday’s inner Cabinet that any concessions are more likely to come after a vote has been lost — so there was a case for pressing on.What May thinks the way ahead is remains unclear even to her inner Cabinet, much to their frustration.“The main problem is that it is very dficult to read the PM,” one tells me, adding that, “Until she decides what she wants to do, it is very dficult to put weight behind any ­particular outcome.”Backbench Tory MPs are also becoming increasingly irritated with her.One senior figure who is ­normally sympathetic complains that she has become “completely messianic about the backstop”. This source says that Tory MPs “want to hear a solution rather than this is the only choice and they’re stupid”.Allies of May are deeply pessimistic about the EU offering any meaningful concessions.Their view is that the EU thinks that the alternatives to May’s deal are either a softer Brexit or a second referendum, so it has little incentive to offer much up.Not everyone in the Cabinet is so sure.One senior minister, with Prime Ministerial ambitions, has been explaining to junior ministers in detail how they could negotiate a better deal on the backstop.Tory leadership contenders are readying themselves.They calculate thatthe vote goes ahead this week May will lose by a big margin, the  letters will then go in and May could well lose that vote of confidence, triggering a contest.If she does go ahead with Tuesday’s vote, she’ll be betting her premiership on keeping the margin of defeat respectable. It would be a mighty gamble.There are two reasons for this. First, the Labour front bench are not keen on Norway-Plus and a number of those on the Labour benches who did support it have moved to backing a second ­referendum. Second, there is now more Tory opposition to it than there was before, particularly among the Cabinet.One Secretary of State warns that a Norway Plus deal “would destroy the Conservative Party forever”.The problem is that in an effort to make the plan acceptable to the Europeans, it has gone from being a temporary solution that would give the UK time to negotiate a free trade deal with the  EU to an indefinite arrangement that involves accepting the withdrawal agreement and with  it the ­backstop. This all makes it much less ­acceptable to Brexiteers.Even those in the Cabinet who are sympathetic to the idea admit that it would face problems.One tells me: “I am not sure it is possible because so many people would trash it.”Norway-Plus would also require a new leader.Those close to May say she could not endorse a deal that did not end free movement.EVENthe Government loses heavily on Tuesday, it would still survive a vote of confidence.The Tory rebels and the DUP have been clear that they would vote for the Government in that debate.This poses a dilemma for Labour.It means that any attempt to bring down the Government would fail, and risk providing a rare moment of Tory unity. I understand, though, that opposition parties have been mulling a dferent approach – a censure motion in the PM.This would allow the House to express its disapproval of May’s handling of Brexit, without bringing down the Government.The thinking is that this might persuade the DUP to support it.  It would demonstrate that without them, the Government cannot win a confidence vote.Traditionally, these censure motions have been accompanied by a cut in salary for the minister concerned. But there are worries on the Opposition benches that such an approach could backfire because it would look too personal.So,the UK couldn’t now leave without a deal without facing catastrophic consequences, who should carry the can for that ONE theory doing the rounds this week is that May could resign as PM and advise the Queen to ask her de facto deputy, David Lidington, to form a government.This government would then, so the thinking goes, move towards a Norway-style deal.But I am told there would be resignations from the Cabinetthis happened, and a leading Tory backbencher warns that such a government would not be able to command the confidence of the House.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it is not the serious, sensible, unying compromise he believes. Nor does it deliver on the referendum.Joining EFTA — part of the European Economic Area — alongside Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein would leave us nominally “out” of the EU. But that’s pretty much where it ends.We would still be in the single market, accepting free movement, with a supposed “brake” we would never deploy.Worse, we would remain in an EU customs union too, to “avoid” the mythical hard border in Ireland no one will ever build.We would effectively still be EU members  with no vote, nor power to strike our own trade deals — wrecking Brexit’s central economic case.It’s a non-Brexit that only satisfies Remainers. The Leave victory was motivated by a desire for sovereignty, including  control over immigration. This fulfils none of it. It won’t fly.Even a second referendum is better  — though obviously “Remain” cannot be on the ballot, the first vote having ruled it out.CAN the Government not see the obvious conclusion voters draw from its zombie-apocalypse vision of a no-deal Brexit Downing Street trots out these scenarios — medicines, food and water running short and bodies going unburied — like they were inevitable. But it was their job to prepare us. Had they done so from , we would be in good shape.Chancellor Philip Hammond actually considered it irresponsible to spend money on it. The Government, incredibly, feared upsetting Brussels.Now they’re saying: “Brexit’s coming! Look how little we’ve done to be ready.”It is jaw-dropping negligence.He seriously claims Labour could secure all the benefits of the single market while defying its rules, including on immigration, and staying in a customs union while doing our own trade deals.Literally none of it is possible.

So why do my friends think they must vote for it Because they believe that there is no alternative: that we may not like what has happened – but that we have run out of time and run out of road.It is crucial to understand that this pessimism is just flat wrong.If this deal is voted down on Tuesday – and I devoutly hope it is - we need to do two big things.First we need to change the Withdrawal Agreement, keeping all the sensible things that have been agreed on citizens’ rights, but getting rid of the “backstop” agreement on the Northern Irish border.We should use the so-called transition period both to negotiate a big and generous zero tarf zero quota free trade deal, and to solve the technical problems posed by the Northern Ireland border.There is no reason why we should not use that time – almost two years – to put in place the systems that will allow our whole country to come out of both the customs union and the single market, which is what the people were promised both at the referendum and the general election.We should be clear that we will keep back at least half of the £billion until the free trade deal is done.And second it is time now to show our EU friends that we mean business.This should be a take it or leave it offer – and so show that we mean business we must be able to walk away.This is a great country, capable of rising to immense challenges – and I believe the people of this country are fed up to the back teeth of being told by their government that they are simply incapable of managing the logistical problems of Brexit, when for two and a half years this government has studiously and deliberately failed to address those logistical problems.It is that failure and that lack of resolve that has so weakened our hand in the talks.Now is the time to get on with it – and remember,we have to go down this route, we will have the entire £billion to spend on it.We need to get our ports ready, hire the staff, ensure that the planes can fly and that companies are helped to transfer their data under any circumstances.I don’t believe for a moment that our EU friends and partners want such an outcome.They have a £ billion surplus with us in goods alone.They don’t want barriers to trade.They want a deal as much as we do.Do you really think that the people of the Calais region would be gratefulthe Paris government took steps to block commercial traffic from the UK Have you seen what is going on in France No one wants disruption of any kind – and the way to avoid it is to get ready to manage it now, with energy and conviction.We can still get a great deal, and I am sure we will.

No s and no buts.In June , . million people voted for Brexit, more than for any political party in British history. Over two years later, it’s time to settle the squabbles and get on with the job.I want MPs to support the Prime Minister’s agreement on Tuesday because it offers the surest path to Brexit.The alternatives – a second referendum or no Brexit at all – would fly in the face of the will of the British people. Instead of honouring and respecting the referendum, politicians would be ignoring the result.Pulling out of the EU is a hugely complex task. Leaving a bloc that we joined nearly  years ago, while staying friends with its members, means that everyone has to compromise.Some people legitimately say that the Withdrawal Agreement is not perfect, but it offers the most practical way of doing what the British electorate want.People voted to take back control of our borders, laws and money. This deal fulfils those instructions, while protecting jobs and the integrity of our United Kingdom.If you are in the EU, you have to accept the automatic right of any citizen of any other member state to live and work in your country.This agreement will end that situation and restore the British Government’s power to decide who should settle in our country. We will admit people with the right skills for our economy, regardless of their background.Britain is generous and tolerant, so the rights of EU citizens already living here will be protected, along with the rights of Britons residing in the EU.We will also stop making vast annual payments to the EU, allowing the British Government to decide on public spending priorities.As I know from my previous job, this Government’s priority is the NHS. By , we will be investing an extra £ million in the NHS every week.Tomorrow I will go to Brussels to meet fellow Foreign Ministers from across the EU. We will discuss how to take forward our work to counter the common threats from terrorists and hostile states. That vital task will continue under the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal, which allows us to work together when it makes sense, and go our own way when we want.The real choice is not between the Prime Minister’s agreement and a perfect solution.The real choice is between this agreement and going back to square one and running the risk of Brexit not happening at all.

A coloboma describes a condition where tissue in or around the eye is missing at birth.Her heartbroken parents David and Cintia were told by doctors the conditions mean Liliens eyes resemble a cats, as the iris is narrow and discoloured.But despite her blindness, Lilien’s family insist she’s a happy girl who can’t stop smiling.Cintia, , from Hemel Hempstead, Herts, said: Liliens eyes are the same size as a cats and will never grow properly.When they do grow they will look like a cats with the same line across them.The condition wasnt picked up until she was five days old and we were totally devastated.She’s our little girl and we want the best for her and we’ll do everything we can to make sure she has the best quality of le possible.Cintia added that while her daughter is developing, it’s still upsetting because she can’t see anything.She can’t do things that most baby’s do because she can’t see.It can be really heartbreaking sometimes when we go out to see other children.Microphthalmia is an eye disorder which affects the size of the eyeball while the coloboma creates a hole in the retina, leading to a cat-like appearance.Lilien’s conditions mean that she’s unable to play with toys and hasn’t as yet shown any sign of beginning to crawl or move independently.David, , said their baby can’t play with normal toys or do lots of things that most normal babies do so obviously that’s tough.She can play with toys that emit lights or flash and she enjoys those but she can’t crawl or do things like that at all yet.She smiles all the time though and that warms your heart.At her -week scan, Cintia was told Lilien was not growing sufficiently.Doctors later suspected that she had eye problems around the time of her three-week scan.But it wasn’t until Lilien was born that doctors realised the full scale of her condition.Her mum said: When she was born her eyes weren’t open but we didn’t think anything of it.But as the days went on she still wasn’t opening them.

Butit cant get one, Labour is prepared to thrust Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street as Prime Minister with the backing of other left-wing parties. Our preferred option, very, very strongly, is that we refresh the Parliament, he told Sky News Sophy Ridge on Sunday. Though we are ready to form a minority government should that be necessary – and it could happen on Wednesday morning – and to begin to reset the negotiation and take the country forward in a much better direction. Mr Trickett left all options on the table - but also dashed the hopes of many Labour MPs who want a second EU referendum.  He said a public vote should be the last resort once other options are exhausted. And he claimed it could take six or seven months to arrange, meaning it would only happen after Brexit Day on  March . Mr Trickett said: I thinkpeople feel that a privileged political elite has decided by subterfuge to find a way of reversing the previous referendum, that would cause us some dficulty - and rightly so. I think we need to show to the country that we’ve been through the ious dferent options andat some point a referendum becomes absolutely necessary, it’s at that point that it takes place.It can take months, six or seven months, to organise a referendum because there is no law which allows us to do it so we have to pass a law.  We have to decide what the question is, we have to renew the people on the voting lists and then there has to be a period of time for the referendum so we think the earliest it can take place is probably May or June. In the meantime, every day that passes is another day nearer to potential disaster. And we say we need to reset the negotiations straight away on a new basis and come forward with a dferent way of mending our country and its relationship with Europe. It came as Theresa May warned Tory MPs she genuinely fears Jeremy Corbyn taking power in a desperate bid for them to back her Brexit deal.  More than  Conservatives have threatened to vote against the deal - enough to inflict a devastating defeat. Mrs May is agonising over whether to delay the vote, which Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay insisted was still scheduled for Tuesday night. Reports today suggested she was preparing a last-ditch dash to Brussels to urge a compromise. Mr Barclay denied the reports, insisting: The vote is on Tuesday, that is what were focused on. Meanwhile her ministers are already rallying around options for a Plan B, including a second referendum.  But in a defiant Mail on Sunday interview the PM claimed she had received , messages of support for her deal from the public. Embattled Mrs May posed with a bloody dficult woman mug and a hole-puncher with PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE FROM OFFICE stamped on it. When I saythis deal does not pass we would truly be in uncharted waters, I hope people understand this is what I genuinely believe and fear could happen, she said.

As the increasingly isolated Prime Minister begins the most tumultuous week of her premiership, she will need that support more than ever. Mrs May’s backbenchers are deserting her in droves ahead of tomorrow’s crunch vote on her Brexit deal, when she is expected to suffer a crushing defeat. More ministers are considering quitting including aid secretary Penny Mordaunt who is said to be weighing up her future. Downing Street insiders say the PM has adopted a bunker mentality, relying on a small circle of trusted advisors to get her through the turbulent days ahead. Mrs May’s cabinet colleagues have grown increasingly frustrated at her reluctance to acknowledge the scale of defeat she faces. “She’s just not listening,” says one. “What’s the point of holding the voteit ends up devastating her Brexit deal and her leadership.”  But Number  insists the vote will take place tomorrow night as planned. “She knows the numbers,” insists a senior aide. A defeat would, they believe, strengthen her negotiating hand. Her weakness at home could end up being a strength with the EU. “She may need a Margaret Thatcher handbag moment with Brussels,” says one minister. “But she needs to have something to put in it.” Her closest aides insist she does have a Plan B. It is based on an amendment tabled by loyalist Tory backbencher Sir Hugo Swire. There may also be “a few other tweaks” including on fishing. But the EU says there is little room for manoeuvre.  The withdrawal agreement is finished business, although they may be able to offer some “helpful” language on the Irish backstop being temporary. But Brussels insiders are clear: any suggestion the Government could make plans to exit the backstop within a year is no-go. Mrs May’s team has ruled out the Norway Plus option because of her red line on free movement. Only a dferent leader could pivot to it, and it could split the party. Her closest advisors believe that a second referendum is the most likely outcome. “We’re not preparing for it and she doesn’t want it but it might be the only way. We think that’s where we’ll end up,” one said. For all the war-gaming, Number  knows it has no control over the PM’s own fate. Labour is not currently expected to put down a vote of confidence straight after the vote, instead waiting until the PM reveals her next move. The real danger comes from within. Tory backbenchers are febrile, with Brexiteers hinting they are - finally - not far off the  letters needed to kick off a contest. It is unclear whether enough would then vote against her. The public may not thank them for leaving the country leaderless at a time of crisis. But it is the Tory party’s “men in grey suits” that pose her biggest risk: senior cabinet ministers telling her that it is time to go. Mrs May is determined to hang on. Tory insiders say Philip May is learning French and German. The question is: will he need it for future Brussels summits, or for holidays during his we’s imminent retirement  "},{"url":null,"title":"tory dominic raab blocks bbc","story":"NewsTory Dominic Raab BLOCKS BBC host who reminds him what he said about foodbanksVictoria Derbyshire was barred from seeing Dominic Raabs profile - while ex-DWP chief Esther McVey refused to apologise for her record on Universal CreditShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video top-tory-sparks-anger-saying-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Tory MP has blocked one of the BBCs best-known TV hosts on Twitter after she repeated word-for-word his comments about food banks.Victoria Derbyshire was barred from seeing Dominic Raabs profile as he faced a backlash for posing with food bank volunteers in his constituency. The ex-Brexit Secretary is one of a string of Tory MPs who have posted pictures of themselves with the charities in recent weeks. The trend has sparked outrage among anti-austerity activists. Foodbank charity the Trussell Trust handed out a record .million emergency parcels last year - and % of users say benefit delays or changes are the main reason they begged for handouts. Mr Raab posted his photo on November , writing: Thank you to Tesco in Molesey and the Trussell Trust for partnering to encourage customers to generously provide food collections for families in our community, who are struggling at this time of year.  Ms Derbyshire pointed out he had blamed soaring food bank use on people who had a cash flow problem - insisting they were not languishing in poverty. Later she found herself blocked.I repeated verbatim what Mr Raab said about people who use food banks.. she wrote.  Mr Raab made the comments in the run-up to last years general election during a debate on Ms Derbyshires BBC show. He said at the time: Ive studied the Trussell Trust data. What they tend to find is the typical user of a foodbank is not someone thats languishing in poverty, its someone who has a cash flow problem episodically.   It came as former Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey refused calls to say sorry for problems with the six-in-one benefit Universal Credit. Instead she stood by her insistence that it makes work pay and hailed her own achievement in getting more than poundbillion extra pumped in. Ms McVey also cast doubt on Trussell Trust warnings that UC sent foodbank demand soaring % and % of recipients find themselves in debt. She told Sky News Sophy Ridge on Sunday: Well the Trussell Trust there, you’ve got to look at where the source is coming from.  Who has been interviewed to give those comments - those are from people coming into the Trussell Trust. So those results werent authenticated, they weren’t veried as such. Ms McVey did however join her successor, new DWP chief Amber Rudd, in calling for the poundbillion benefit freeze, due to finish in , to be lted a year early. She said: We’ve now got to look at the freeze on benefits. Do we still need that. Maybe not.

When she had not opened her eyes five days, doctors realised that adorable Lilien Molnar was blind. And at less than a week old she was diagnosed with two severe eye conditions, microphthalmia and coloboma.Coloboma - also known as cat-eye syndrome - can change the iris from its traditional shape to the narrow shape of a keyhole.Microphthalmia - also known as small eye syndrome - makes either one or both eyes abnormally small. Heartbroken parents David and Cintia have been told their daughter is probably the youngest person in the UK to be diagnosed with both conditions.But despite her blindness, Lilien is a happy baby who cant stop smiling.  Mrs Molnar, , from Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, said: “Liliens eyes are the same size as a cats and will never grow properly. When they do grow they will look like a cats with the same line across them. “She’s our little girl and we want the best for her and we’ll do everything we can to make sure she has the best quality of le possible. “She can’t do things that most baby’s do because she can’t see. It can be really heartbreaking sometimes when we go out to see other children. Microphthalmia is an eye disorder which affects the size of the eyeball while coloboma creates a hole in the retina, leading to a cat like appearance. Lilien’s condition means that she is unable to play with most toys and has not yet shown any signs that she is beginning to crawl or move independently.  Mr Molnar, , said: “She can’t play with normal toys or do lots of things that most normal babies do so obviously that’s tough. “She can play with toys that emit lights or flash and she enjoys those but she can’t crawl or do things like that at all yet. “She smiles all the time though and that warms your heart.” At her  week scan, the mum was told Lilien was not growing sufficiently. Doctors later suspected that she had eye problems around the time of her  week scan. But it wasn’t until that Lilien was born that doctors realised the full scale of her condition.  Her mum added: “When she was born her eyes weren’t open but we didn’t think anything of it. “But as the days went on she still wasn’t opening them. “Five days after she was born, the optometrist came in to see her and tried to open her eyes. “I saw her looking at the doctors and shaking her head. “When they told me that she was blind I just collapsed. It was devastating. “I remember crying and shouting, saying that it wasn’t true and that she couldn’t be blind.”  Now Liliens parents are having to come to terms with the fact their smiley daughter may never see. Mrs Molnar added: “It’s dficult to think that your daughter may never see your face and there are days where that does get to you.

Experts spent nine months meticulously developing the state-of-the-art apartments which feature a ‘Woom’ bedroom with a cocoon-like bed, inspired by the safety and snugness of the womb. With muted lighting, soft pink walls and high-tech mattresses, each ‘Woom’ bedroom within The Zed Rooms has been designed to encourage positivity, relaxation and REM-rich sleep – the type of slumber which promotes learning and creates dreams. Engineered for optimum slumber away from home, the innovative apartments are a collaboration between sleep technology company, Simba and design-led serviced apartments Cuckooz, and are available to book in London’s Tech City, Shoreditch. Resident sleep psychologist at Simba, Hope Bastine, said: “If you’ve ever noticed that you don’t sleep as well in a hotel, you’re not alone.   “Scientists recognised the ‘first night effect’ over a decade ago, where one half of the brain unconsciously acts as a ‘night watchman’ staying more alert when in unfamiliar surroundings. “With this in mind, tapping into the emotional and physical, no stone has been left unturned trying to soothe the effects of this in the design architecture of our new cutting-edge sleep retreat.” During the last weeks of pregnancy, a baby increases its consumption of REM sleep, hitting a letime high of twelve hours a day in the final week before birth. There will be no other moment during a person’s le when they will get such a huge volume of REM sleep. Radiating the security and snugness of the womb, the state-of-the-art bedroom design aims to help mute the brain’s ‘red alert’ status it develops when sleeping in a new place.   Using insights rooted in the science of sleep, The Zed Room apartments have been designed to engage with every sensorial touchpoint of the body, creating an entire ecosystem that helps you to sleep from the moment you step through the door. The furniture’s rounded edges and softened corners mimic the sensation of bed, while rocking chairs are on hand to lull you into a relaxed state of mind. There are bespoke sleep recipe suggestions, rich in serotonin, melatonin and tryptophan, created in partnership with celebrity favourite, Detox Kitchen. Featuring restorative scents and colours that relax muscles, invoke calm and mimic the moonlight air cleansing soporic plants to eliminate toxins and healing background harmonies to unwind. Each apartment also comes complete with yoga mats and meditation sessions via the iPad’s Calm app. The second bedroom is also designed for dreaming, draped with luxurious ethereal fabrics and artwork to transport the mind. Steve Reid, co-founder of Simba, said: “The Zed Rooms aren’t a traditional getaway.  “They are geared entirely to honing quality sleep away from home. Fine tuning you overnight to navigate at whatever le throws at you the following day.” Co-founder of Cuckooz, Fabienne O’Neill, added: “We strive to be at the forefront of innovation within the hospitality sector and to push the boundaries when it comes to guest experience. “Design and wellbeing are at the heart of everything we do. We believe our homes should be more than an apartment.The Zed Rooms incorporate Simba’s award-winning Hybrid mattress, developed using complex body profiling data of  million sleepers, and temperature regulating pillows and duvets, using space-certied technology. It aims to deliver the ultimate restorative sleep environment for business travellers as well as those looking for the ultimate urban weekend retreat. Stays at The Zed Rooms start from pound night.

Six-year-old Riley Meredith-Morgan lost his two upper front teeth when the tool was thrown during an outdoor school forest lesson. The youngster is unable to eat or drink without using a straw - and will be toothless for Christmas as he waits to seethe adult teeth will grow back.A dental x-ray revealed a third set of teeth above the gum, but it could take up to six years for these to grow through, report Gloucestershire LiveMum Susan, , is disgusted after an external health and safety review investigated the incident and concluded it was an accident. Susan, a mum-of-three, claims she has not even had an apology from Rileys school, Severnbanks Primary in Lydney, Gloucestershire, following the incident on November . Susan was shocked when she saw Riley after getting a message to say he had been injured during forest school, which teaches children about natural woodland. She said: When I got to the school he was still in shock. My six-year-old boy had been hit in the mouth with a hammer and had his front teeth knocked out. It broke my heart to see him. He had to have time off school because of the severe discomfort and and he couldnt eat or drink without a straw. The injury itself is healing now but its not just the physical damage. I had to fight with him to get him back to school and I feel sick to my stomach every second he is there. The exact circumstances of the accident are unclear, but Susan claims it happened after a group of six-year-old boys were given a safety talk. Forest lessons, such as making campfires and learning practical woodland skills, are growing popular with schools. But Susan says more needs to be done to make the lessons safer after Rileys injuries. She said: They cant seem to see any safeguarding issue here and thats what bothers me. Something more needs to be done. I havent even had an apology from anyone involved. The lack of compassion is unreal, its diabolical.  She says a dentist told her the hammer must have hit Riley in the face with some force to have knocked his teeth out. The following day she was told the other child involved had been excluded for the rest of the day. The pupil then had to spend the following day in isolation. Susan was assured there would be an investigation, and the school referred the incident to external health and safety consultants - during which nobody asked Riley what had happened. And she was left angry to find out Rileys injury was concluded as an accident, and that the school deemed they had taken appropriate action. She said: The punishment for the child is not my issue. Accidents do happen. I just want justice for my boy. I left it over a week to see what they came back with and to seeI would have a written apology, but nothing.  They have left me with no choice but to let people know what happened. Susan says she does not want to take the easy option of removing her three children from the school, which is rated good by Ofsted. She says she will carry on fighting until somebody is brought to book for the accident which could have left Riley needing  teeth at the age of six. Rod Johnson, chairman of the governors at Severnbanks, said the health and safety of pupils has always been paramount at the school and will continue to be so. He said in a statement: The recent Ofsted report acknowledges that the school places pupils well being and safety at the heart of all it does.  The headteacher delegated the responsibility to the deputy head to investigate this matter to ensure it was dealt with impartially, and so there could be no inference of bias or prejudice. The school has followed its normal policies and procedures. An investigation has been undertaken of the incident including risk assessments and interviews with all parties involved. When an incident like this occurs, the school refers the incident to external health and safety consultants. They have considered all the evidence and it is their view that this was an accident.

Mr Bridges, who designed bridges, unveiled a proposal for what is now the Clton Suspension Bridge in Bristol. The arch was to be flanked by six -ft storeys of rooms and galleries, containing homes, a granary, corn exchange, chapel, tavern, museums, general market, a library, a marine school offices and a stables, reports Bristol Live. The proposals were unveiled after Bristolian merchant William Vick left a bequest in his will of pound,and instructed that when the interest had reached pound, it should be used to construct a stone bridge.   However the plans were shelved after the French Revolutionary Wars broke out which affected trade and commerce. Financial firm Quid Corner have reconstructed Bridges idea to show how it would have looked. By , Vicks bequest had reached pound, and a competition was held to find a design for the bridge with a prize of  guineas. Isambard Kingdom Brunel submitted four entries and went on to design the Clton Suspension Bridge.   The Grade I listed bridge opened in  having taken  years to become a reality. The iconic bridge, which links Clton in Bristol to Leigh Woods in North Somerset, was built by William Henry Barlow and John Hawkshaw based on the earlier designs of Brunel.

Joanna Sterling, , has been plunged into debt after she had to pay a second builder to complete her extension after the first one allegedly walked out with her money. Now, Joanna and her two young children face a cash-strapped Christmas in a house that doesnt feel like a home. She said: Ive cried every day. I was numb every day for weeks after and Im now on anti-depressants, reports Chronicle Live. The house isnt going to feel like a home this Christmas. The kids wont be able to have as much as they normally have.   After living in her house in Whitely Bay, North Tyneside, for nine years, Joanna decided to have a porch and downstairs bathroom extension fitted. Although she knew money would be tight, the mum pushed ahead with the plan to create the house of her dreams. In May, Joanna contacted a local builder who had been recommended by friends and asked him to do the job. She gave him a pound, deposit to buy materials after they agreed the work would be done by late June. In the beginning everything was great, she said. He would come every day and we actually used to get on.   The following month Joanna gave the builder another pound, to buy materials, but they never arrived. Her anxieties about the arrangement grew when he stopped turning up to work and the completion date came and went. Joanna said: We had a few arguments. Im sorry but when it got to six weeks past the due date and I couldnt see any evidence of work I said youre taking the mick and this is not good enough. In August, the builder stopped turning up at the house.   Despite persistent calls and emails from Joanna, he did not reimburse her the money to buy the materials. Joanna said she was left living in a house with exposed pipes and bare walls. She claims she had to pay a second builder to carry on the work, but she still cannot afford to have the whole job done. Im completely broke, she said. Ive had to max out my credit cards because Ive had to buy everything again. Ive had to borrow pound from someone and money from my family for my children this Christmas.   Joanna said the ordeal has impacted her two children, Kai, , and nine-year-old Lexi.

Freja Ellis, three, was on a family break in Antalya, Turkey, when her mum Marlana treated her to get a black henna tattoo. But shortly after arriving back in the UK, Freja complained the cat design - which stretched from her wrist to her elbow - was itchy. The design erupted into a series of painful blisters and then became infected. The -year-old mother said: My little girl has been scarred for le after getting what I thought was a harmless black henna tattoo. She has been covered in blisters and in so much pain. Its been heartbreaking.  We were entirely unaware of the dangers and want to make sure other parents know what can happen so this doesnt affect other children. Nurse Marlana said her daughter had been begging for a tattoo after seeing older kids with them. She said they seemed really clean and tidy and because Frejas arm was wiped with an antiseptic wipe beforehand she wasnt too worried.  She said after they got home Freja began to complain of an itching and burning sensation just days later. Single mum-of-one Marlana from Herne Bay, Kent, said: Wed been home for about three days when Freja said: Mummy, my arm, its warm and its itching me. It hurts. I had a look, but there was nothing visible to the naked eye so I gave her some Calpol as she had a bit of a temperature and decided Id give it until the next day to seeshed improved. But when Freja woke up the next morning, she was in tears and a nasty blister had started to appear. She was constantly itching it and had very red, raw blisters full of fluid on her arm. Marlana rushed her daughter straight to the local minor injuries unit, the Queen Victoria, in Herne Bay, Kent and the doctor explained that black henna had been used which contains chemicals which can burn the skin. A chemical called para-phenylenediamine, or PPD, is added to henna to make the tattoos darker and increase their lespan. While PPD is present in many products, such as sun cream and hair dye, it is usually used in very small doses.  The addition of PPD into henna is now recognised as a public health issue, as this allergenic chemical often causes hypersensitivity reactions in children. Three days after the initial diagnosis, Marlana took Freja back to the GP to have her wound re-dressed as fluid was seeping through the bandages. The nightmare got worse when Marlana was told her daughters wound was infected and she was given a course of antibiotics. Now the infection has cleared up doctors are trying to get Frejas arm to scab over and heal.  I just dont want any other families to go through what we have, she said. Frejas tattoo will most definitely scar as the burn was quite deep - hopefully it will fade in time - but it will definitely leave a mark. I want to make people aware because so many children have them done on holiday. Frejas going to be scarred for le - shell forever have a cat on her arm.

But within five years the business was worth poundmillion - although by her own admission it has not all been plain-sailing. The company, which was started by Julie and her mother Freda Thomas, has now reached its milestone tenth anniversary.To mark the occasion Julie has spoken about the challenges she has faced in a changing industry.Speaking to Cambridgeshire Live, she said: There have been extraordinary highs and extraordinary opportunities but then there have been periods that have been beyond stressful.” One particularly challenging moment came in  when she discovered her manufacturer was copying her bag designs and using her leather she had paid for to launch an identical product under a dferent name.   With , bags on back-order at the time Julie had to set up her own factory in a matter of days, with no previous manufacturing experience. The mother-of-two has also spoken out about the changes she has seen in the industry within the last ten years, and the lack of trust she feels towards influencers. She said: Within two years weve seen people we worked with in that capacity now saying, yes, I will mention you but onlyyou give us pound,. They went from this very authentic community of people who were doing something they loved because they want to do it, to suddenly being paid to say what they loved and then the lack of trust that comes along with that.   The Cambridge Satchel was dubbed the British It bag in  by the New York Times after Julies fluorescent-coloured satchels were paraded around New York Fashion week by certain bloggers. The company’s remained adaptable over time, especially in relation to how the digital world has changed in the last decade, dramatically affecting retail. She said: “There are always new challenges. Andit’s plain-sailing then it probably means you’re not noticing the monster that’s coming up in the rear view mirror.” Julie also has strong values which are clear and strongly represented in the brand - championing British manufacturing is one such passion.   Julie’s an ambassador for the Queen Elizabeth Scholarship Trust, a charity which supports the training of people in British craftsmanship. Talking of the craftspeople at the company’s workshop near Leicester, where every bag is handmade, she said: “Those are the people that know the skills because they used to make leather goods when craftsmanship was not as unique a thing in this country. Who’s going to pass down those skillswe offshore everything  Preserving that is important.” We struggle with our profitability every year. If I decided to offshore my manufacturing we would be profitable overnight – but is that the right thing to do  I don’t think it is.” "},{"url":null,"title":"inside kate middletons 2m home","story":"NewsInside Kate Middletons £m home she shared with Pippa before marrying WilliamWhile the three-storey Cha home might pail in comparison to the stunning -room Kensington Palace that now houses Will, Kate and their three children, it is not going cheapShareCommentsByMirror:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsThe Middletons bought the home for £, in  \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA three-bedroom apartment fit for a future queen has been put on the market.

The planned departure of one of the Queens most trusted aides comes shortly after Meghans personal assistant Melissa Touabti also quit, just six months after the Royal wedding at Windsor Castle in May. A source close to Meghan told the Sunday Times: Sam will be a huge loss. Going forward, Meghan might need someone cut from a slightly dferent cloth to traditional courtiers, who is not a career civil servant or royal insider.

The Duchess of Sussex married TV producer Trevor Engelson in Jamaica in . Meghan and Trevor tied the knot in front of around  close family and friends - including Meghans mum Doria Ragland - at the Jamaica Inn in Ochos Rios. But it was claimed neither her dad nor her half-sister Samantha Markle attended the nuptials, prompting fans to question how long their bitter feud has been going on. Thomas, , has now spoken out to correct the lies he says have been spread about him. The retired Hollywood lighting director may have missed out on walking his daughter down the aisle at Windsor Chapel in May - but he had a starring role at her first wedding.  The The Mail on Sunday reports that Thomas provided a photograph of him and Meghan moments before he and Doria walked her across the sand to be wed. The camera-shy father-of-the bride claims there are no pictures of him at the wedding because it was on the beach and everyone  was in their s and I was in my s. Thomas says Meghan planned everything down to the tiniest detail, including an unusual welcome gt for guests - a bag of MARIJUANA.  Mr Markle told the Mail on Sunday: It’s illegal, but it’s no big deal in Jamaica. It’s almost customary down there. I don’t smoke weed and to the best of my knowledge nor does Meghan. I don’t know what I did with mine. I think I gave it away. Thomas also showed the newspaper Meghans first wedding invitation, which read: Cheers to love, cheers to laughter, cheers to happily ever after. Sadly, two years later, the marriage was over.  Mr Markle also told how he is dreading his first Christmas without a card from Meghan saying: “I have been frozen out”. He revealed how they were once close in a series of heartfelt letters his daughter sent to him saying I love you with all my heart – now and forever’. The affectionate letters are addressed to ‘Daddy’. In one she vows: All I want to do is make you proud… and I promise, no matter what, I’ll do it. In another she thanks her father for taking the best care of me and adds: I love you to no end.  But Thomas says he is not expecting a Christmas card from his daughter or Harry this year adding: I have been frozen out and I can’t stay silent. I have made dozens of attempts to reach my daughter via text and letters, but she and Harry have put up a wall of silence. They have done what they once told me not to do – they are believing everything negative that has been written about me. So I am reaching out to them, once again, to try to correct the lies and get the truth out there. Everyone says, why don’t I just shut the f*** up  That Meghan can’t speak to me because I’ll give away secrets. But that’s bull****. I’ve been accused of every terrible thing you can think of. In one magazine they had an awful story about Prince Charles right beside one about me. But no one is shunning Prince Charles.  The fall-out with Harry and Meghan came after he staged paparazzi pictures shortly before the couple’s wedding in May and then suffered two heart attacks, preventing him walking his daughter down the aisle at St George’s Chapel, Windsor. He hit back at grievous lies against him and produced evidence in the form of photographs, medical statements and even a faded plane ticket that he says proves he is telling the truth: He insisted: I had two heart attacks, the second of which the doctor called a widow-maker and nearly killed me.  Mr Markle says he has hundreds of notes and cards from Meghan, who lived solely with him from the age of  until she went to university. He added: People are trying to rewrite history. Meghan and I were as close as a father and daughter could be right up until her wedding to Harry. Then it all fell apart. Sitting in a hotel room close to his home in Rosarito, a beach town just across the US-Mexico border, Mr Markle said he has repeatedly reached out to Meghan to try to heal the rt. I have sent several texts. Her number hasn’t changed and they haven’t bounced back, he says. I’ve pleaded with her to pick up the phone. I wrote her a two-page letter and sent it by certied mail via her representative in Los Angeles. I asked her why she was believing the lies.  I also pointed out the Royals haven’t always been perfectly behaved. I wrote that Ive never played pool naked, nor have I dressed up as a Nazi [a reference to Harry’s infamous pictures in Las Vegas in  and the time that he wore a crude imitation of a Nazi unorm, including a swastika armband, in ]. I even hand-delivered a letter to Doria asking her why our daughter won’t speak to me. Everything has been met with a stony silence. Their silence means people continue to attack me and write lies about me.

The standby runway - known as RunwayR - has presented Gatwick with a potentially signicant hazard after four other flights have failed to take-off from the right spot in as little as six months. The latest incident involved a Dreamliner flight to Buenos Aires in March which was almost a kilometre beyond the beginning of the runway when it took off with  passengers and crew on board. A newly-published report by the Air Accident Investigation Branch said the crew did not identy the beginning of the runway and found there was just m of runway left when the plane thrust towards the skies at mph.  The branch said any attempt to abort the take-off could have triggered a potentially catastrophic “overrun”. The hazardous runway was fitted with a sign in the early s after previous reported issues over many years. Despite the sign being illuminated at night none of the crew recalled seeing it before take-off. The Norwegian airline crew reported that the take-off seemed normal with one crew member adding: The runway looked pitch black and the only thing we saw was the green lights.  The report added: “The crew did not identy the beginning of the runway and taxied forward to the landing threshold before beginning their take-off. “This decreased the take-off distance available and meant that the aircraft did not meet regulated performance requirements for its actual take-off weight. “The distance available for the take-off would have been insufficient had an aircraft engine failed and had the crew decided to stop The report also revealed four other flights failed to start at the right spot on the same runway between September  and March this year.  As a result the airport operator has agreed to increase awareness of the beginning of the runway, especially at night. The airport operator has also set up a working group to look at issues associated with Runway R after a number of incidents in . A review undertaken of the markings revealed they were not EASAcompliant and remedial work was planned for September earlier this year which would increase the number of arrows painted on the centreline. Gatwick has committed to raising awareness of crews about the location of the beginning of the runway. Airport bosses have also proposed bringing it into routine use for departures as part of a strategy to increase capacity.

Kensington Palace “was less a home than a prison” for the Princess of Wales, Sarah Bradford recounts in her book Diana. One member of the royal residences staff told the author: “It was a small apartment, it needed to be bigger really. “They had a sitting room and a study each, then a drawing room, then a dining room and that was it really, as far as reception rooms went. “Not a lot of corridor space, so it wasn’t very comfortable. “They needed a second reception room downstairs so that upstairs would be private, but the way it was it was all in together. “They were far too important to be in such a small apartment. “I think the apartment contributed to certain tensions, they were on top of another as regards what they were supposed to be doing.”  According to Bradford the palaces thin walls made finding a quiet spot particularly dficult. Patrick Jephson, Princess Dianas private secretary from  to , confirmed the cramped nature of the quarters. He said: “Everybody could hear everybody . “If you needed to get away from someone there was just not enough space.” Princess Diana and Prince Charles first moved into apartments  and  in Kensington Palace in , the year of their marriage. They remained there together until their orce in . The Princess of Wales continued living in the house until her sudden death in .  Today the palace has two main s. As well as housing a museum that is open to the public, it is the the official residence royals including Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince William. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle also live in the palaces grounds, although they are planning to move to Frogmore Cottage in Windsor next year. Kensington Palace issued a statement on November  confirming the move.  It read: “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will move to Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor Estate early next year as they prepare for the arrival of their first child. “The couple have lived at Nottingham Cottage since their engagement last year. “Windsor is a very special place for Their Royal Highnesses and they are grateful that their official residence will be on the estate. “The Duke and Duchess’s office will continue to be based at Kensington Palace.” Rumours have swirled in the weeks following the announcement as to why the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are moving away from William and Kate.

The plastic covered tunnel linking a Sainsbury’s store in Bude, Cornwall, to its car park has been thrilling visitors this year after unexpectedly topping TripAdvisor’s list of things to do in the seaside town. It’s racked up hundreds of comments with the majority of tongue-in-cheek reviewers rating the mcar park tunnel as ‘excellent’. It’s now been decked out by Sainsbury’s with nearly , pixels of light and more than . miles of cabling – making it one of the longest light tunnels in Europe. To celebrate the tunnel, staff went all-out with its Christmas offering, bringing the entire community together. As well as a lighting setup more commonly seen at Hyde Park’s Winter Wonderland, locals were treated to complimentary mince pies while being serenaded by local choirs and dance troupes.  The tunnel is lit during store opening hours, and will be open to visitors and shoppers until Thursday th December, and will continue to operate as the main thoroughfare between the supermarket and the car park. Trevor Plant, , runs a taxi firm in Bude and also helps with the campaign to ‘Light up Bude’. He said: “Light up Bude came about around three years ago, as our town Christmas lights weren’t great. We’ve run fundraising campaigns, and this year people have just donated what they want.  “I get people in my taxis asking to see the tunnel – I point it out as we go past, and some of them say ‘What’s that – that’s just a Sainsbury’s ’ and I say ‘No, that’s Bude Tunnel!’” On TripAdvisor the tunnel is described as: The only tunnel Bude has to offer is open to the public free of charge, walk from the Sainsburys car park to Crooklets Road completely undercover, protected from the elements whilst maintaining your view to the spectacular surroundings of Bude.” The initial review was written by a mysterious internet commenter known only as ‘Barry Barnett’, and was posted in late  – gathering steam ever since.  ‘Barry’, who wishes to remain anonymous, was at the festivities undercover, saying: “The tunnel is something I have long admired, it’s oddly charming. “It has a fantastic perspective of repeating arches along its , it’s curious as it doesnt really need to exist yet it does - this is part of its charm and the reason I decided to list it on TripAdvisor. “The lights that have been installed look amazing, they really accentuate the structure of the tunnel.  “It’s great that this has happened alongside Light Up Bude, hopefully it will bring even more people to visit and be a good thing for the local community to enjoy.” Mum-of-three Kayleigh Vernon, , has lived in Bude for  years. She said: “I think it’s great, it gets people out. There have been loads of people going in and out of it all afternoon.” Even the Mayor of Bude, Bob Willingham, was in attendance. He said: “It’s unbelievable, it’s so impressive. It’s people power, that’s what it is.  “I’m so glad it’s the number one attraction in Bude, Sainsbury’s have really taken it on board. But the whole of Bude is unbelievable. We’ve got beautul clfs, a fantastic harbour, and a canal that’s celebrating  years of its birth next year. “Whether it’s cold and wet or sunny, you just have to wear the right clothes. It’s a wonderful place to be. Everybody’s caught up in the moment, enjoying the spectacle.” And Bude Sainsbury’s store manager Steve Gent added: “We’ve been overwhelmed with the positive response for the Bude Tunnel. “We’re delighted to be working with the community to give it all we’ve got and bring the people of Bude something magical this Christmas.

In a moving account of her struggles living on the new benefit system published by iNews, the anonymous woman spoke of the severe poverty affecting her family. In the run up to Christmas there will be no festive events for the family, who cannot afford to go ice-skating or visit the pantomime. In a bid to cheer up her home the woman has recycled old bottles and food containers, turning them into make-sht Christmas decorations. She hopes she will be able to get hold of a branch to use as a Christmas tree.   The woman said: I sometimes feel like stealing food from my friends cupboards and this hurts my heart. I look out of the window and envy people with cars who are going out, going to the cinema, affording hair cuts and new clothes while I struggle to get food every day. Thank you Universal Credit for the extra sadness and pain and hurt. Eager to stop such sadness affecting her daughter, the mum started collecting sugar packets from a cafe along with shampoo and pens from charity shops to put in her stocking. In another bid to spread some festive cheer she has plans to make Christmas crackers using free cosmetic samples and toilet rolls donated by her landlady.   The familys problems began when the woman moved town to get more support for her disabled daughter. Not being able to afford a removal van meant they were only able to bring a suitcase of clothes and school items. The familys lovely cats - who had provided emotional comfort to the daughter - had to be left behind. For Christmas dinner the family will tuck in to a small joint of gammon that the mum bought from the reduced section of a supermarket and has stored in a friends freezer. Not having access to an oven, she plans to use a clothes iron to heat up saucepans and some candles to boil water for coffee.   Although the mum does admit that she could have saved up each week in the months running up to Christmas, she was forced into debt earlier this year by emergency accommodation that cost nearly pound, a month. The familys dire financial circumstances mean the daughter goes to school each day without having had breakfast and unlikely to get any lunch, with only a selection of reduced sandwiches to look forward to when she comes home. The situation has left the woman feeling broken, undermined, useless and destroyed. When asked about the case a spokesperson for the Department of Work and Pensions said: The majority of people are comfortable managing their money but for those who struggle our Jobcentre staff are able to offer budgeting support. We have also recently agreed a partnership with Citizens Advice to help vulnerable people make their benefit claims.

For Petra Sajban, from London, things are a little dferent. The -year-old works as a professional cuddler, which she claims is her dream career and she splits her time between hotel rooms and her customers homes. Petra recently opened up about the ins and outs of her unusual job and revealed what kind of people require her services.   Speaking to The Sun, Petra revealed she first discovered the special power a hug can have in . At the time she was working as a care assistant and helped to brighten a paralysed patients day by giving her hugs. She said: One of my favourite patients was a middle-aged woman whod been paralysed. For years she hadnt been touched other than to be showered or moved, so when I first met her I askedshe wanted a hug. Despite her paralysis, she could blink to say yes, and her eyes lit up when I held her.   Knowing that I was bringing a sense of connection to her le was an amazing feeling. Then in , Petra stumbled across an article about professional cuddling and instantly knew it would be the perfect role for her. Despite some worries that it could be a festish service she soon learned that cuddle therapy was a serious and much-needed business. She claims the work involves completely platonic sessions which include talking, hair-stroking, eye-gazing, hand-holding, hugs and ious cuddling positions.

But at one school in in Nebraska, children were facing a rather miserable festive season after their headteacher attempted to ban a iety of Christmas items from classrooms.Principal Jenner Sinclair of Manchester Elementary School in Elkhorn, sent a memo round to staff advising them on what would be deemed acceptable and unacceptable in terms of Christmas decorations and school assignments.Teachers were told that generic winter-themed items, such as sledding, hot chocolate and Olaf from Disneys Frozen, were allowed.Among the list of not acceptable items were Elf on the Shelf, Santa Claus, Christmas trees, Christmas music, anything red or green and reindeer.The principal also took specic issue with candy canes, as she deemed them to have religious signicance. In her memo, she wrote: Historically, the shape is a J for Jesus. The red is for the blood of Christ, and the white is a symbol of his resurrection. This would also include dferent coloured candy canes. I feel uncomfortable that I have to get this specic, but for everyones comfort I will.  She went on to explain that these decisions were made in order to be sensitive to ious religions, cultures and beliefs before signing the memo from TheGrinch who stole Christmas . Following the circulation of the bizarre Christmas guidelines, RT reports that upset school staff got in touch with the Liberty Counsel, a Florida-based First Amendment group. The group are thought to have penned the school district a letter, asking them to reverse the ban.  Sinclair has since been placed on administrative leave. In a statement The Elkhorn School District told Fox News: The memo does not reflect the policy of Elkhorn Public Schools regarding holiday symbols in the school. Their policy states that Christmas, Santa Claus and Easter eggs and bunnies are considered to be secular, seasonal symbols and may be displayed as teaching aids provided they do not disrupt the instructional program for students.

We can’t take our foot off the gas and it was disappointing.“Look, I’m sure all the boys have experienced heavy defeats before and it’s not nice but, as the manager’s been saying, it’s about how you react.“The manager’s been brilliant at saying ‘look that’s us drawn a line under it’ and all our focus has been on getting back to winning ways and trying to get some positivity about the place and smiles on the boys faces again.“If we can go and win three or four games in a row then, hopefully, that result will be forgotten about.”And Booth feels the timing of their blip is a positive because there is plenty of time left this season to recty it.Following the game in Greenock today, United face Inverness in the Highlands as they aim to close the six-point gap on Ayr.And Booth insists that is the intention, saying he does not want to go through the turmoil of play-off disappointment again after last term’s relegation with Partick.He added: “They’re hugely important, absolutely massive games, especially with the gap at six points just now, they’re vital games.“We’ve two tough away games in Morton and Inverness coming up but we’ve been playing quite well away from home this season so, hopefully, that can continue and we can keep picking up results and close the gap over the festive period.“No one would really want play-offs but we’ll see what happens. Ayr have, obviously, been flying and they’re doing really well and County are up there as well but we’ve managed to narrow the gap to kind of make it a three-horse race.“We just need to get back on the same kind of run we were on before last Friday night, we’d been playing really well and were getting all the praise.“Hopefully, coming up to Christmas and New Year, we can put another run together and I’m confident we can.”Looking ahead to the game at Cappielow today, Booth is well aware Morton will be hurting, too, and look to recover after last weekend’s - loss to Dunfermline.“It will be a tough game. Their results have been up and down this season, they have some really good results and then, like last Saturday, not so good.“They probably deserved to win the game up at Tannadice earlier in the season, I think we scored a rd-minute equaliser.“It’s going to be a hard game but one we’ve prepared for well this week and go into it confident.“We’re both going into it on the end of two shocking results last weekend so it’s going to be about who reacts best to that.“Hopefully, with the squad we’ve got and how hard we’ve been working, then we’ll be the team that comes out on top.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c0a4bb3f394d.jpg ","title":"i left my drink for about 20 seconds woman tells of being spiked on dundee night out","story":"A woman has relived the horror of her drink being spiked in a Dundee students’ union after campaigners called for lids to be placed on drinks in pubs and clubs.Girls Against Spiking have launched a campaign with the backing of Police Scotland.It was revealed only a quarter of drink spiking crimes are detected, with only four recorded crimes in Scotland in .Rose Crowe, , a sales assistant from Invergowrie, had her drink spiked at DUSA The Union, calling the incident “a complete violation”.The frightening episode, which took place in December  when she was , is thought to have been the result of a prank.She said: “It is definitely the worst thing that has ever happened to me on a night out.“I went to the bar and paid for a drink then spotted some of my other friends and I went over to hug them.“I left my drink for about  seconds before I came back to get it, so it was enough time to have been spiked.

He was taunted with a sickening monkey gesture by Rangers fan Paul Kenny during an Old Firm match in April .The former Manchester City and Aston Villa player later revealed he had never suffered racist abuse before the incident in that Old Firm match last year.McInnes said: “It is truly shocking in this day and age that players are still subjected to that.“I have kids myself and it is a totally dferent environment to when I was growing up when these sorts of comments were a regular occurrence.“Just because they are not as regular as they were when I was growing up doesn’t mean to say it is any less shocking.”Show Racism The Red Card Scotland have slammed the behaviour and urged any fan witnessing racist abuse at football matches to contact a steward or Police Scotland.A statement read: “Show Racism the Red Card Scotland are saddened to see a video that allegedly shows an Aberdeen FC fan racially abuse Celtic’s Scott Sinclair just before he takes a penalty at the weekend’s League Cup Final at Hampden Park.“There is no place for racism in Scotland or Scottish Football and we encourage anyone who witnesses racism or experiences racism to tell a steward or call Police Scotland on .“Such behaviour has no place in a progressive Scotland.“Racist attitudes are often supported by misinformation, therefore education and the opportunity to talk openly and honestly about these issues is needed now more than ever.”When contacted Celtic declined to comment.Meanwhile, Aberdeen today face in form St Johnstone at Pittodrie.McInnes said: “I was delighted with what the players gave me at Ibrox and they got their just rewards with the victory.“It’s the same three points available today and we’re going to have to play well against a team who’s been in good form.“We’ve got it all to do again and it’s a big effort physically with a third game in six days.“Hopefully the confidence from Ibrox will help us try deliver another good performance.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/12/2805278-846x564.jpg ","title":"four north east homes available to rent from 480 a month","story":"Every week we feature a selection of our favourite properties available to rent in the north-east.Today we’ve picked these four properties are all available from £ per month. vw, px\"  Located in the sought-after area of Rosemount, this one-bedroom ground-floor flat would make a good home for a young professional couple.The flat benefits from an abundance of natural light and has electric heating and double glazing.The property has an inviting hallway, bright lounge with a dining area, kitchen fitted with a range of wall and base units, a well-proportioned double bedroom with a range of high-quality furniture and a modern shower room.The flat is available for lease on a fully-furnished basis.Viewing: Aberdein Considine on   vw, px\"  This three-bedroom terraced house is located in the popular area of Osprey Heights in Inverurie.The stylish property, which enjoys modern comforts of gas central heating and full double glazing, is available for lease on a fully-furnished basis.The accommodation comprises of a welcoming entrance vestibule, lounge, contemporary dining kitchen fitted with a range of wall and base units, utility room, bright master bedroom with a lot of storage space, two further bedrooms and a bathroom fitted with a white three-piece suite incorporating a shower over the bath.Viewing: Aberdein Considine on   vw, px\"  Set within a popular and established residential area of the city, this three-bedroom, self-contained upper apartment is available for lease on a fully- furnished basis.Offering a spacious level of versatile accommodation set over two floors, this property has a spacious lounge with period features, smart dining room, generously-proportioned and fully-equipped dining kitchen, utility room, three good-size double bedrooms, cloakroom and a family bathroom with a bath and a separate shower cubicle.Viewing: Gavin Bain  Co. on   vw, px\"  Situated minutes from Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and within walking distance of the city centre, this three-bedroom mid-terraced granite townhouse is close to shopping and recreational amenities.Victoria and Westburn Park as well as specialist shops in Rosemount are also nearby.The accommodation comprises a bright and airy lounge with large windows and a fireplace, well-appointed sitting family room, good sized and fully-equipped dining kitchen, modern shower room, generously-sized master bedroom, further well-proportioned double bedroom and a games room study.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"south argyll schools reach bowl final","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowSouth Argyll Schoolstravelled to Eastwood High School in Glasgow on Tuesday November  to play in the Scottish Schools Bowl semi-final.The game was played in good conditions and the team were looking forward to building on their recent quarter final performance.The game started with an early converted try for SAS but they were pulled back to - by half time.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta.

These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead opens up for christmas","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowShop locally or risk losing our distinctive shops.

Darren Boyd, of Thornyflat Street in Ayr, admitted to assaulting David Mackie on July  this year at McLean Street in Ayr. He also owned up to uttering threats of violence towards him. Boyd appeared before Sherf Scott Pattison at Ayr Sherf Court last week. The court heard how the -year-old ‘repeatedly punched’ Mr Mackie on the head. Depute Fiscal Andrew Lazzarin explained: “At around pm, the complainers were at their home when they heard a noise and went to see what it was. There was a household item lying in the garden. They went to speak to the neighbour about why this was there. “The accused was in the neighbour’s house and assaulted the complainer by repeatedly punching him on the head. “The complainer then went home and the accused went back into the neighbour’s house. The police were contacted and the complainer had a small cut on his lip - he was taken to AE. “Police were unable to find the accused as he had left the neighbours house at that time. “On another occasion, it seems that the complainers were driving to the locus and the accused was shouting towards them saying, “I am going to kick your c**t in”.  “Police were contacted again about these matters.” Defending Boyd, Tony Currie added that Mr Mackie was the neighbour of his partner and there had been “ongoing issues” between them. He said: “These incidents were because of his partner’s ongoing issues with the complainer. “She was receiving ongoing complaints from them. “He had been at his partner’s house at the moment the complainer came to the door, who was kicking the door and was challenging towards his partner. “She was heavily pregnant at the time.” Mr Currie added that there has been no further issues in the interim and the couple are hoping to relocate. Sherf Pattison said: “I was considering sending you to jail - you need to know that this type of violence cannot continue.” As an alternative to custody, Sherf Pattison ordered Boyd to carry out a community payback order with  hours of unpaid work to be completed in nine months.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire swimmer 67 proves age","story":"NewsAyrshire swimmer, , proves age is no barrier after scooping medal on debutHe finished the ‘swimming marathon’ at Tollcross in Glasgow in a very impressive .:.ShareByGary Fanning:,  DEC NewsDundonald swimmer Sandy Mavor \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSwimmer Sandy Mavor proved age is no barrier as he claimed a bronze medal on his competitive debut at the Scottish National Masters m Championships. The -year-old finished the ‘swimming marathon’ at Tollcross in Glasgow in a very impressive .:. Sandy trains with the Masters squad at North Ayrshire Swimming at the Portal in Irvine after taking up the sport again when he retired seven years ago. “I swam at school a long time ago,” he explained. “I did the Loch Lomond  mile swim, and the Cumbrae to Largs in August, so I thought I’d try a pool swim. “The coaches here were brilliant here when I arrived. They couldn’t have been more welcoming and helpful - especially for refining my e off the starter blocks! “I think Masters is not quite so competitive so you can just go along and enjoy it. It’s good exercise and you get a good community and it keeps you fit and ticking over.” His first pool race didn’t go entirely to plan, it seems. “I got this racing ‘bullet cap’ and they told me to put another one underneath to stop it coming off, but it didn’t seem to work,” he laughs.  “I don’t know at what point I lost it but apparently I was in the lead for the first eight laps so maybe that was when it happened  I managed to retrieve it from the bottom of the pool at the end of the race, though, and I was very proud to be wearing the North Ayrshire cap.” Sandy’s success shows that swimming is a sport for all ages, with the benefits increasing as we get older as an ideal form of resistance training which is also kind to the joints. “It’s never too late,” said Sandy from Dundonald. “I speak to a lot of people who’ve never done crawl and they say ‘I could never do that’ but I’ve heard of beginners starting really quite late on in le. Initially they can’t swim onebut before they know it they’re swimming a mile. Once they’ve cracked the mental barrier they’re away.” Masters swimming is increasing in popularity, according to North Ayrshire’s head coach, Jess Wilkie. “It’s good for all ages to come down and meet new people and learn new skills, which you can’t beat,” she says. “We like to keep it ied and try and do a bit of everything to suit everyone from distance swimmers to those who want to come in and do a bit of technique work. “What we always say is that there’s a lane for everyone – it doesn’t matter what speed you swim, you can still participate. “I think the oldest swimmer we have is in her s and she’s still firing up and down the pool and matching younger guys.” “There are plenty of sessions to choose from whether you’re a morning person or prefer to exercise in the evenings.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13689315.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS170228854.jpg","title":"ayr uniteds somerset park football","story":"NewsAyr Uniteds Somerset Park football ground damaged as car ploughs into turnstilesThe vehicle smashed into historic Somerset Park shortly before pm last night.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsSomerset Park damaged after car crashes into ground\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA football clubs stadium has been badly damaged after a car ploughed straight through its turnstiles.

We visited a school in Midlothian who had a Cockapoo puppy and we knew we could make it work for us. She has changed the dynamic of the school.Peggy will live with Caroline, but will be in school full-time.Having settled into her new home at Priorsford Primary this week, Peggy is already the most popular pupil in school.Despite skipping five primary year-groups to join the P class, Peggy is at the very start of her journey to becoming a certied school dog.ldquoShe has settled in well and has already met the pupils at assemblies. My daughter is a vet and told me to expose her to everything straight away. The time between eight and  weeks is really important for stamping the personality and the secureness of the puppy, added Caroline.Peggy is learning how to become a listening dog, who will help children read aloud more confidently. She will put her head in their lap and listen without judgement, prompting them to turn a page with her paw.Caroline explained: ldquoNot only will she improve the pupilrsquos literacy skills, Peggy will be there for any children who are feeling anxious or worried, they can take some time out to talk to her.I joined the P class in the library as they read the tale of Greyfriars Bobby to Peggy.

But a vision of an angry mob in blue chasing me through the playground fills me with fear and I decide she is exactly where she should be.It is said that dog is a manrsquos best friend.

That science has or will find solutions to all our manmade problems. The issue with this approach has always been that, experiments carried out in controlled environments like laboratories and then replicated in nature have always been unexpected and sometimes catastrophic.These scientic methods involved limited assessments and tests and mainly conducted for profit by big pharma!Having covered Making Scotland GMOFree in my previous column I will focus on our next vision, which is to make Scotland a  per cent organic country.The green revolution introduced in the s, sprayed fertilisers and pesticides on farm land all over the planet to increase crop yields. This in turn led to many forests being cut down to grow what was then called lsquocash cropsrsquo and small-scale farming was replaced by industrial farming on a massive scale supported by government subsidies.Big corporations acquired land across the globe, food was added as a commodity to be traded for profits on the stock market and this in turn has led to inequalities in health and access to food especially in developing and third world countries.The unforeseen impact of chemicals for growing over the last few decades, has led to the fall of nutrients in the soil, as this was being depleted by over use and irregular crop rotation. Profits were maximised and are even today. For example, soya beans are now grown in many countries as cattle feed for the West! This then leaves no arable land for the local population to grow food leading to widespread hunger and impoverished conditions.We need to go back to our roots and grow food at local levels on a small scale and bring back farming as a lucrative job for people to invest their time and energies. This will be a sustainable long-term approach and remove the need for farming subsidies that are the biggest scandal of our times as most go to big landowners in this country. Can you imagine governments are currently paying farmers in some cases not to grow Organic farming will not only bring back the health of the soil but also stop corporations making money through selling chemicals and hybrid seeds. This will have a positive impact on the lives of all people as lsquoorganic produce will no longer be the domain of the rich and middle class who can afford to feed themselves and their children with good food. This choice should be available to all.So! Whatrsquos happening globally where organic farming is concerned  Denmark is on its way to becoming the worldrsquos first  per cent organic country, followed by Bhutan and Estonia. India has the North-eastern state of Sikkim designated as the first fully organic state anywhere in the world and was awarded the UN lsquoOscar for the Best Policy that is inclusive and comprehensive of all socioeconomic aspects.Can Scotland be  per cent organic  Yes! It can."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-factory-announces-50-redundancies","story":"ONE of the regions major manufacturers has announced that it is looking to pay off more than  members of staff.Jedburgh-based Mainetti UK is looking for voluntary redundancies following a second year of reported losses.Bosses at the Oxnam Road coat-hanger manufacturer are blaming recycling and a reduction in high street retailers as well as an increase in the minimum wage for combined losses over the past  months of more than pound million.Mainettis Regional MD Jim Hutchison stated: \"The last two years have been dficult for the business.\"In  Mainetti UK Limited made a loss of pound, and this year we are forecast to lose a further pound,.\"The business is faced with an ever increasing cost base with increases in the National Minimum Wage, higher electricity costs and higher business rates.\"To add to these cost pressures the business is seeing local UK demand for hangers reducing.\"Many retailers are closing down shops or reducing their selling space and this means there are less hangers required.\"In addition, an increased emphasis on recycling means more hangers are being ed from stores for resorting, which further reduces manufacturing demand.\"Mainetti UK currently employs around  staff.Talks have already started with unions over the planned  redundancies.Mr Hutchison added: \"These changes will only impact the Jedburgh hanger manufacturing unit.\"All other products made in Jedburgh ndash flower buckets, polythene bags, Glastic and The Seatcase will not be impacted and in fact the company will continue to invest in all these areas during , in order to grow those parts of our Jedburgh manufacturing business.\"Local MP John Lamont has been in talks with the company over the past few days.He told us: ldquoThis is disappointing news from a long standing employer in Jedburgh.ldquoClearly their market is changing and Mainetti are having to adapt to that.

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets. On the hillside, , stark white tombstones bring home the enormity of what was done over only a few days a mere  years or so ago.More than , died at Srebrenica , perished in Sarajevo , women suffered rape as an act of war millions fled their homes, some even finding their way to the refugee reception centre at Cheylesmore Lodge in North Berwick.All the survivors I met asked the same question: why did so much suffering have to happen before the international community acted to stop it  In telling us their story, they relived their own pain. They did so in the hope that we learn the lessons of Bosnia. We need only look at Syria or Yemen to know that we have not.That is why we must remember Srebrenica.If any local groups would like to hear more about the work of Remembering Srebrenica, please contact my office on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"the-best-fortnite-gifts-for-christmas-2018","story":"Fortnite is the most popular video game of the year and has taken over not just everyonersquos console, but Christmas lists up and down the country too.If you have family members, big or small, who are mad for Fortnite but find yourself utterly clueless as to what itrsquos all about or what to get someone who loves it for Christmas, we can help out with this guide to everything Fortnite from the game itself to presents you should buy this year.*On some occasions, we earn revenue from content.

Whatrsquos the story  Read on.Historical highlightsThough the surrounding area has been farmed for at least , years, Tobermory itself ndash which means Tobar Mhoire or ldquoMaryrsquos well in Gaelic - was established in  by the British Fisheries Society as a herring port.Kelp was an early boom industry , but tourism took over in the th century following visits by the German composer Felix Mendelssohn in  on his way to Staffa, and Queen Victoria in .During World War Two, the town was home to the Royal Navy training base HMS Western Isles.Tobermory is a place that fires the imagination. Alistair MacLeanrsquos novel When Eight Bells Toll was based in the town, while much of the  movie was filmed here and in the surrounding area, as was the  Powell and Pressburger film I Know Where Irsquom Going!Tobermory even has a Womble named after it, and in the early s it gained a new legion of young fans ndash and visitors - when it stood in for fictional Balamory in the much-loved BBC childrenrsquos programme.What to doIt may be small, but the Mull Museumon Main Street offers a comprehensive and insightful history of the island and its people through a wealth of objects, photographs and written accounts.At the far end of the bay sits the Aquarium , whose unique ldquocatch and release policy means the sea creatures here are only on display for a few weeks before being released back into the wild. Currently closed for the season, due to re-open at Easter.Just along the road is the excellent Tobermory Distillery , one of the oldest in Scotland established , which produces two distinct single malt whiskies. The tour is informative, fun and excellent value ndash and yes, you get to enjoy a generous dram at the end.While strolling along the waterfront, pop into the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust , where yoursquoll find an incomparable mine of information about the sea mammals that live in waters around the island. The charity has been researching, conserving and monitoring whales, dolphins and porpoises up and down the west coast for  years, and offers a range of opportunities for visitors to get involved, from boat trips, educational visits and scientic placements to the mobile app.If sailing is your thing, yoursquoll want to come back in the last week of July for the West Highland Yachting week .Therersquos a thriving and erse cultural scene in the town, too, much of it based around An Tobar, Tobermoryrsquos creative hub, a five minute walk up the hill from Main Street, run by community arts collective Comar .

If you prefer classical music, the intimate Mendlessohn on Mull festival takes place in early July.Tobermory has some of the loveliest and most accessible island walks in Scotland. My own favourite is the .km circuit through woods to the picturesque Rubha nan Gall ndash ldquoStangerrsquos Point - lighthouse, built in  by David Stevenson.Those looking for a whole day of sightseeing, nature-spotting adventures, meanwhile, will want to opt for one of the many bus, boat or bike tours that operate all year round.

Itrsquos a stunner to look at, like antique Italian terrazzo flooring, but therersquos nothing really to relish about it, other than the classy extra virgin olive oil dressing, because the octopus itself, shaved breathtakingly thin, possibly using a mandolin, needs salt and retains only a memory of fish flavour, so that is drowned out by acidic lemon flesh, croutons, and capers.My main course John Dory, on the bone, as ordered, has been char-grilled.

Its almond and pistachio packed granola has the gritty, sweet stickiness of those praline peanuts you get in French fairgrounds itrsquos not unpleasant though, albeit I donrsquot appreciate the rancid pecans. I guess the sorbet must be pear, but its flavour is anonymous.Chocolate tart is vastly superior, an exceptional filling with a consistency somewhere between mayonnaise and mousse, unimpeachable pastry thatrsquos thin, nicely golden, and evenly baked, flanked by a quenelle of simple, clean-tasting milk ice cream.No alcohol, no coffee, yet with service our bill for two comes to pound.

I felt bad going back to work when she was nine months old and putting her into nursery. Everything came to a head.\"Jacine, , decided to take a three-month sabbatical from her job so they could stay on in Uganda and figure out a plan. \"By the end of that three months we decided to start a business,\" she says.That business was making rum. Jacine, who grew up in South London, has proud Jamaican roots. Her grandparents were part of the Windrush generation who had arrived in the UK during the s.\"I married into a beautul Ugandan family and spent a lot of time in Uganda and Kenya where I had seen lots of sugar cane,\" she says. \"I was asking for rum and I was never able to get any. I found this very confusing and would say: Do you know what we do with the sugar cane in Jamaica \"That got us thinking: Why is there no rum coming out of Uganda when there is sugar cane here  and Where are all the African rums on the global stage  Then we looked wider beyond rum at where Africa figures in the world of fine spirits.\"The continent gets flooded with spirits made all over the world but in terms of home-grown African spirits ndash considering the amazing natural produce ndash we were perplexed at how few there were. It became a mission to showcase Africa in the world of fine spirits.\"Pauls favourite tipple has long been whisky. \"We dont really drink rum in East Africa,\" he says. \"For me, marrying into a Caribbean family was an education. My drink was always Scotch whisky, but when you go to a Caribbean party, you cant really bring Scotch whisky hellip\"Jacine shakes her head, laughing heartily at the notion. \"Her relatives taught me about Jamaican rum and introduced me to all the brands,\" Paul adds. \"It made me wonder why I had never tried rum before. When it is made well it is a beautul spirit.\"Together the couple began to learn more about rums from across the Caribbean islands while pondering how to make their own East African iety. \"We had the idea to launch Matugga not having any experience in the sector,\" says Jacine. \"We saw a gap in the market and went for it.\"Everything had to reflect our positioning which was Africa and the UK ndash this interesting duality ndash and nobody  was doing that. We also had the innovative idea for our rum to be smoky. That is because this gentleman\" ndash she gestures to her husband ndash \"is a Scotch whisky man.\"This gave birth to Matugga Golden Rum followed soon after by Matugga Spiced Rum with Paul, , spending hours in the kitchen ndash the collateral damage his singed eyebrows ndash as he attempted to nail the perfect combination of botanicals .\"The one thing that is spiced across East Africa is tea,\" he says. \"It doesnt matter where you go, there is a masala chai that they do. We selected five spices ndash ginger, cloves, vanilla, cardamom and cinnamon ndash plus the tea to go into our rum.\"The molasses are sourced from Tanzania and Kenya. \"We wanted to use molasses from Uganda, but the Ugandan sugar market is a bit unpredictable and volatile,\" says Paul. \"We thoughtwe spread it across East Africa, we can still get themthere are any price fluctuations.\"It is three years since they first unveiled Matugga at the London Rum Festival. Initially the duo worked with a contract distiller but since moving to Scotland have been able to begin production in their own facility at Brucefield Industry Park, West Lothian.Their move to Scotland came about when Paul, a civil engineer by trade, began studying for an MSc in Brewing and Distilling at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. The couple have fallen in love with their new base since arriving last year. Livingston is home now.Paul is the master distiller for Matugga with Jacine, who has experience in business start-ups alongside her marketing background, taking on the role as CEO.They make an impressive and formidable team. Jacine is the more outgoing of the two, warm and gregarious, while Paul is a little shyer and softly spoken but clearly every bit as driven as his we. He admits that ideas for new recipes are constantly percolating in his mind.Later, when Jacine is getting her photograph taken over by the rum casks, Paul talks me through some his latest \"experiments\" for future Matugga limited edition expressions. His eyes light up as he speaks. This is a man who has clearly found his vocation.\"I almost cant sleep at night,\" he says with a grin. \"I have so many ideas. It is only through having our own distillery that you begin to realise what is possible. You dont really understand a spirit until you have smelled and tasted it being made from the start.\"By doing that you get to know where all those little flavours come from, the bits that you dont usually get to taste because they never make it to the bottle. It is a huge spectrum.\"His latest prototype, says Jacine, has sent them down a new and unexpected road. A ripple of excitement passes between them as they talk about the future. \"There is definitely going to be more,\" they say in unison.\"We have released a Mavuno range with a special edition each year,\" says Paul. Beside him, Jacine adds: \"We use a lot of Swahili ndash the language of East Africa ndash and Mavuno means harvest. This is the harvest of Pauls experimentation. We will do , bottles in that edition.\"The distillery ndash believed to be the first of its kind in central Scotland ndash is equipped with two -litre copper pot stills, capable of producing , litres of artisanal rum in its first year, the equivalent of two million single rum serves.Over the next  months, Matugga is forecasting a  per cent increase in turnover and hoping to create five new full-time roles including positions in distilling and business development.In recent weeks, they have undertaken crowdfunding which has netted pound, to support the couples ambitious expansion plans. One of the options offered to those who contributed was the opportunity to purchase a private rum cask.\"Similar to whisky cask ownership, you would buy a rum cask and we would look after it for three years,\" says Paul. \"Rum doesnt need a long maturation phase. We project within three years it would be very delicious and ready for bottling.\"We think that will coincide with the point that rum becomes the next thing. If you are going to buy a cask, you dont want to buy it in three years time, you want to buy it now.\"Over the past decade, the gin-making industry has mushroomed in Scotland with a raft of new distilleries and craft brands. According to Scotland Food and Drink,  per cent of the UKs gin is produced here and sales are expected to hit pound.bn by . Could rum go the same way Paul and Jacine certainly hope so. Matugga is among a handful of dedicated rum distilleries in Scotland. Dark Matter Distillers in Banchory, Aberdeenshire, launched in  and Wester Spirit Rum, thought to be Glasgows first rum distillery in  years, opened last month.Moray-based Beach Craft Spirits produces three ieties of small batch rum including sloe and spiced. NB Distillery in North Berwick, known for its gin and vodka, recently added rum to its portfolio. The Strathearn Distillery in Perthshire introduced Dunedin Rum in .Paul and Jacine believe that over the next few years we will see more rum brands springing up across Scotland. They are delighted to be at the forefront of that revolution. \"The magical thing is that now we are here, places have really inspired us,\" says Jacine.\"We are talking about bringing Africa to Scotland, but we want to showcase our own foraging and exploring Scotland in terms of flavours. It is about discovery for us.\"We are working on a new line that had so much goodwill from people in Livingston and beyond. They seem to be really excited about what we are doing.\"It has all been really positive. It is an adventure. We honestly didnt know how we were going to be received. We rocked up here with our family and were hoping everyone would be welcoming, which they have been. There has been a lot of excitement.\"Pauls love of whisky was a big factor in their choice of base. \"Absolutely,\" he says. \"It could only be Scotland. The quality of Scotch whisky is the highest in the world in terms of distilled spirits and I knew thatwe were going to align ourselves with good standards it was going to be in Scotland.\"He has found other upsides too. \"The benefit of Scottish water is that there are not a lot of minerals in it. It is very soft water. You can imagineyou had a kettle down south, the inside would be covered in white stuff.\"We would have to remove all that stuff from the water and it would clog up the purication filter. It is an absolute nightmare to make wine, beer or spirits from.\"The water here is fantastic for brewing and distilling. The weather helps, too, because we generally have cool temperatures and a moderate summer in Scotland, so we are not over-ageing our rum stock. It is gently maturing in a way you can control it.\"If you were distilling, for example, in the United Arab Emirates you would need to put the casks in a basement with air conditioning. Scotland is perfect to mature spirits.\"The name Matugga comes from family owned land in Uganda. \"Traditionally in Uganda when you get married your father gives you a piece of land to grow crops and feed your family,\" says Paul.\"My brother was given a piece of land he didnt particularly like, so he decided to sell it and buy land with my mum in Matugga. My mum really fell in love with this piece of land. She was an agriculturist and teacher of farming. My mum farmed that land with such passion.\"After his mother passed away in , the -acre expanse took on an even more special meaning. \"I remember standing there thinking: This is amazing,\" says Paul. \"Most of it is unspoiled. It is not savannah ndash this is green. There are passion fruit vines growing, some chillies. It is beautul.\"My brother told me stories about how it used to be a sugar cane plantation and when they first bought it, they found all this kit for harvesting sugar cane. I thought: I think we are being told something here. We are being told to do something that is sugar cane based hellip\"Jacine takes up the thread. \"It was a very spiritual time,\" she says. \"My family is from Jamaica and Africa is my heritage. It was almost like a homecoming and being welcomed by my Ugandan family.\"It was where we had the idea to make rum. This land represents Uganda and the whole continent. It has beauty and serenity and all the wonderful produce. It became the heartbeat of our brand.\"Visit matuggarum"},{"url":null,"title":"christmas-comes-early-as-airlines-slash-cost-of-flights","story":"No-frills giant Ryanair led discounting this week with some weekendfares lower than the price of a cup of continental coffee and a bun.The Irish carrier was offering to take passengers to and from both Ireland and Germany this weekend for less than pound.Air fares watchers say canny travellers can pick up deals - even for the school holidays to winter sunshine destinations like the Canaries.Ryanair at one point had s from Prestwick to the Tenere for the Christmas and New Year week for pound and s of pound to Fuerteventura for the fortnight up to the holidays.Discounting is common in the weeks before and after Christmas - but prices usually soar during what is the busiest period of the aviation year. Industry insiders are reluctant to talk up low fares amid concerns that some airlines may not be able to keep Scottish routes profitable.A spokesman for Edinburgh Airport said: ldquoEarly December is traditionally a quiet time for aviation and therefore a great time to get a good deal on flights.ldquoCanny shoppers or those wishing to get away before a hectic Christmas are all picking up great bargains.ldquoScottish passengers have the choice of more destinations than ever and wersquore seeing increasing numbers of passengers travelling year on year.The pound collapsed the early morning of the Brexit vote and has been under pressure ever since. The UK is due to leave the EU at the end of March with fears rising of a no deal scenario and its devastating impact on Sterling.Last month holiday operator Thomas Cook - whose planes do a lot of the heavy lting of tourists from Scotland to sunshine destinations - announced that its profits had noseed after lower exchange rate and higher summer UK temperatures.Also last month regional airline FlyBe, amid low profits, a weak pound and Brexit uncertainty, put itself up for sale.Throwaway fares - prices so low would-be travellers book them on impulse - might sound like good news. And any airline will discount to put bums on seats. However, travel experts stress that the cost of a holiday - in sterling terms - is still high. You might get to Fuerteventura this month for the cost of apeak train fare from Glasgow to Edinburgh. Yet when you get there you will have to pay in euros for accommodation and food.The prospect of a clf-edge departure from the EU worries continental holiday providers. The head of Spainrsquos national tourism agency in the UK said a no-deal Brexit would be lsquoa disasterrsquo for his country.Discounts are particularly steep on flights to Germany, Ireland Scandinavia, where costs for Scottish tourists with pounds in their pocket are particularly high and where the weather is far less warm than the CanariesNorwegian this month has s to Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm for under pound. Ryanair had s to some of same cities - but not always the same airports - for between pound and pound.The low-cost airline this week was offering December weekend s to the Baian city of Memmingen for pound. and Derry in Northern Ireland for pound. from Edinburgh. Fares have since edged up to around pound each.Next weekend flights to the sunny Canarian island of Lanzarote are down to pound , leaving on Friday and ing on Monday.Industry insiders stressed that the airline recently cut the size of its free hand luggage and was therefore in a position to offer lower fares. Its change, which came in to place on November , has angered some consumer groups. One Spanish organisation said the move was ldquoabusive.Experts also said travellers should look out for more deals in January - when EasyJet has s from Glasgow to Venice for pound, including a more generous hand luggage allowance than its rival.For the week beginning January  Ryanair has fares from Edinburgh for poundto Alicante and Fuerteventura, pound to Porto, pound to Dublin, pound to Derry, according to the Scottish-based fares comparison site SkyScanner.For the same week, SkyScanner showsfares of pound from Prestwick to Malta on Ryanair, pound from Glasgow to Dusseldorf on Eurowings and pound to New York via London on British Airways.Hugh Aitken, of SkyScanner, explained: ldquoIn most cases, airline pricing works in tranches ndash a limited number of very low prices, for example, may be available for a limited number of seats.ldquoThere are generally multiple lsquofare bandsrsquoavailable for each flight. Once a certain fare band has been booked up, the next one will be displayed, and this will likely be at a higher price, as you might expect with a supply-demand model.ldquoAs an example, The Herald found a Prestwick to Tenere flight for pound ndash the price is now pound, most probably as the lower fare band has been booked up.ldquoAirlines want to ensure they maximise loads and encourage travel, so travellers may additionally see lower prices and sales for travel during January: this tends to be a slightly quieter month when compared to peak holiday times such as Easter.The flip-side of the falling pound is that more people from overseas are travelling to holiday in Scotland. Even flights to sunshine destinations - such as Italy and Spain - once filled with Scots are seeing growing numbers of inbound passengers, say insiders.

It was a bottle of South African sparkling wine by the vintner Graham Beck. The wine was good, but it wasnrsquot special - it was the occasion which made the wine great.It was  years ago, and Hoyrsquos we Mary had just given birth to their first baby Emily. The couple were living in South Africa, working in the wine business, and after their daughterrsquos christening, Justin and Mary journeyed into the bush and drank the sparkling Beck amid one of the most beautul landscapes on earth with their newborn baby beside them.lsquoIt was probably not the best sparkling wine in the world, but for that occasion it was absolutely perfect,rsquo says Hoy. Thatrsquos what wine does, it underscores the events in le which matter. Mary laughs and says hersquos making them sound like terrible parents, drinking in the wild with their baby.Hoy hates the expression lsquowine expertrsquo but like it or not thatrsquos what he is, one of Scotlandrsquos best connoisseurs. Spend an hour in his company and yoursquoll learn more about wine than you could from a decade of experimenting as an amateur wine buff on your own.As National Wine Week comes to an end today, Hoy is singing the praises of wine and the role it plays in human culture and society. Wine has been with us for at least  years - the earliest archaeological record of wine-making is dated to about BC in Armenia. Wine writer Aaron Pott says there is a theory, though, that wine is much older - that wine began when some ancient human lsquochanced upon some wild vines in late fall, their bunches well past ripe, rotten and slightly fuzzy with a blush of mouldrsquo. They would have tasted the sticky juice and become euphoric - and so wine quickly became part of religion as it seemed to connect us to the gods. The ancient Greeks and Romans deied wine in the rites of Dionysius and Bacchus - and it remains embedded in our culture today.lsquoWine is so important in society as we use it as the major part of any celebration,rsquo Hoy says. lsquoHumans are incredibly gregarious, we love celebrating and will find any reason to be together whether itrsquos a birth, christening, marriage, finishing school - we find reasons to have a celebration, and the major part of that celebration is when wersquore toasting whoever it is thatrsquos getting married or winning a race.lsquoTake that same idea across to a dinner party. It doesnrsquot matter how many people are coming, when they cross your doorstep yoursquoll give them a beer or a gin and tonic, but thatrsquos not why you invited them - the reason you invited them is that part of the evening when yoursquore all sitting around the table focused on each other and having a good time and the food comes out and yoursquoll notice all the other drinks go out the window and are replaced by wine - wine becomes the centre of the table. We change to wine as that is the celebratory part of the evening. Thatrsquos the importance of wine, itrsquos all about the occasion. Itrsquos how we celebrate.rsquoHoy has spent his le in the wine trade. Born in England, he married a Scot and the pair went to South Africa to run a vineyard. He later moved back to Scotland, where he now runs the Glasgow Wine School.The secret to winersquos beloved role in human le is its connection to food and social interaction. Sure, says Hoy, you can drink it to lsquoget pissedrsquo but therersquos much more to wine than that - unlike other drinks which exist primarily to get you drunk.Food is at the heart of every culture on earth, and wine elevates food. Wine is completely natural, like the best food - itrsquos just grape juice, yeast and sunshine. In wine, itrsquos the acidity and the tannins - the chemicals extracted from the grape skin that dry the mouth - which, when matched with a simple plate of food, can create something sublime. Other alcoholic drinks donrsquot have the same type of acidity thatrsquos found in white wine or the tannins in red wine.lsquoAcidity is a really good palate cleanseryou are eating fatty food,rsquo says Hoy. lsquoOne of the most magical food and wine parings is champagne and fish and chips.rsquo The fatty, oily fish and chips coat the inside of the mouth, and that deadens taste buds leaving the brain bored with whatrsquos being eaten. A sip of acidic champagne washes the mouth clean and the palate is ready to experience the taste of fish and chips all over again.With tannins itrsquos all about the interaction with salt - think of a hearty stew or a bowl of spaghetti bolognese, a lot of the flavour comes from the salt in the food. lsquoSalt suppresses the perception of tannins,rsquo Hoy says, lsquoand once it does that it gives the impression of the wine being more fruity. One of the things we know works really well is a nice big steak with an Argentinian Malbec [a red] - itrsquos become one of the great things in le. Malbec has a very high tannin level and when we cook steaks therersquos salt in the cooking process, so put them together and suddenly the wine becomes this juicy drink.rsquoHoyrsquos tip for matching food and wine is simple - lsquothe more flavour you have in your food, the more flavour you should have in your winersquo. He gives the example of a dinner of smoked fish with a cream sauce. lsquoThe sauce is where your fattiness will come through, so you will need a bit of acidity in your wine. If you tried to match a Sauvignon Blanc the flavours of the dish would overpower the wine as it doesnrsquot have a huge amount of flavour necessarily - butyou changed that Sauvignon Blanc into a nice wooded Chardonnay the wine will stand up to the food and still have the acidity.rsquoWith something like a green salad, though, a wooded Chardonnay would kill the delicate summery taste, but a Sauvignon Blanc is probably perfect. The worst food and wine matching, says Hoy, is red wine with dessert. The clash of sugar and tannin is frankly disgusting - so what you need is a desert wine, something like a Sauterne. lsquoThe wine you are drinking must always be sweeter than the food you are eating,rsquo says Hoy.Hoy wants to remove all the snobbery from wine. Getting the right drink to go with the right food shouldnrsquot be the domain of the middle classes - itrsquos about taste, not money, and we all have taste. Of course, many wines arenrsquot cheap, but over the years low cost wines have filled supermarkets and a half decent red or white can be picked up for the same price as a six pack of beeryou know what you are looking for, and what food will go with it.Jay McInerney, the acclaimed American novelist and wine writer, says having less money will make you a more astute wine drinker as you are lsquoforced to make choices and sacrices that can only sharpenrsquo discrimination and appreciation. lsquoStarting at the top, one will miss out on the climb,rsquo he says.McInerney makes discovering wine sound like a mysterious journey, and indeed there is something deeply mysterious about wine. The film Sideways is adored by wine drinkers as itrsquos a tragi-comic love story wrapped in a homage to the vineyard. In the film, one of characters, Maya, has a speech in which she talks about wine asitrsquos almost human. lsquoI like to think about the le of wine,rsquo she says, lsquohow itrsquos a living thing. I like to think about what was going on the year the grapes were growing how the sun was shiningit rained. I like to think about all the people who tended and picked the grapes. Andits an old wine, how many of them must be dead by now. I like how wine continues to evolve, likeI opened a bottle of wine today it would taste dferent thanId opened it on any other day, because a bottle of wine is actually alive. And its constantly evolving and gaining complexity. That is, until it peakshellip and then it begins its steady, inevitable decline.rsquoFor Hoy, wine is about simplicity. A winemaker in ancient Rome could make as good a wine as the wealthiest and best equipped vineyard owner today. lsquoIrsquove seen people make the most astounding wines in plastic tanks,rsquo Hoy says. lsquoIrsquove worked in some vineyards in France where the equipment was as old as the hills and I thought there was no way you can produce decent wine here, but you taste the wines and theyrsquore remarkable. The very best wines in the world are the ones where the wine-maker is working with what nature has given them - not adding or taking anything away.rsquoThose great wines are down to what the French call lsquoterroirrsquo - the land, the environment in which the grape is grown. The secret is getting the right grape for the right soil and climate. Once that sweet spot - that Goldilocks zone - has been found then nature will take her course.Of course, not everyone is in love with wine. The writer Rory Sutherland finds itrsquos the snobbery that kills. lsquoFor the drinker to demonstrate status and connoisseurship,rsquo he says, wine must become lsquoabsurdly hard to navigate, so providing opportunities for contrived, hair-splitting distinctions that let the buyer advertise his own discernment.rsquoOthers, quite rightly, worry about health effects, like Dr Susan Biali, a wine drinker whorsquos now more or less on the wagon. lsquoI love wine,rsquo she says, but she admits to an addictive personality and recalls the aggressive breast cancer her mother had in her s. When Biali heard the renowned Hard-trained gynaecologist Sara Gottfried say lsquowhat you think wine is giving you, itrsquos actually taking awayrsquo, she decided to quit. lsquoThe truth of this resonated so completely with me that it pushed me over the edge. No more wine, or alcohol, period, except on the rarest occasions like a special dinner.rsquoOthers simply hate wine because of the taste. Author Anne Fadiman is the daughter of the late, great wine critic, Clton Fadiman, but she detests Bordeauxs, Burgundys, Pinot Noirs, and Pinot Grigos. Therersquos not a wine she likes - and thatrsquos because shersquos as near as it comes to a supertaster - someone with a higher than average number of tastebuds who can be overpowered by strong flavours. lsquoAs other women fake orgasms, I have faked hundreds of satisfied responses to hundreds of glasses,rsquo she says.Luckily, for the Glasgow Wine School, supertasters are relatively few and far between - therersquos certainly none at the schoolrsquos latest wine tasting evening. Mike Cottam is leading a dozen or so people - of all ages and backgrounds - through the basics of how to get the best from a glass of wine.Each person is concentrating solely on the most sensory experience for a human outside of sex - taste. As they sip and slurp and swirl it seems asthe mouth is the very centre of their being - and perhaps it is, can you imagine how dead le would be without taste One of the tasters, Alec McLean, says wine is about simple pleasures. lsquoItrsquos about taste,rsquo he says, lsquorelaxation. Itrsquos about being slow in a busy world. Itrsquos also about story - where did the wine come from, who made it, and why. Itrsquos not mass produced, itrsquos real. Thatrsquos a rarity these days.rsquoTASTING TIPS: HOW TO DRINK WINE LIKE A CONNOISSEURIf you want a quick guide on how to taste wine, then Madeline Puckette and Justine Hammack at the company Wine Folly are your go-to connoisseurs.They say follow the four simple steps of look, smell, taste and conclude, and yoursquoll be able to navigate the complex world of wine with ease.LOOKYou can tell a lot just by how a wine looks.Tilt the glass over a white backdrop to inspect the colour. The paler the colour at the edge the younger the wine. In a white, a deep gold will be oaked. The darker the red, the higher the tannin.Swirl the wine to see how viscous it is -the wine lsquolegsrsquoare slow then the alcohol is high. Swirling also oxygenates the wine letting flavour out.SMELLHold the glass just under your nose and give it a quick snf to lsquoprimersquo your nose. Swirl, and then get your nose right in the glass and take a deep snf. Now think about what those smells remind you of - donrsquot be scared to move your nose around in the glass as rich fruit smells and more floral smells can gather in dferent places.If your nose gets lsquooverloadedrsquo snf your forearm to neutralise all those wine smells. Donrsquot wear perfume.In wine, the primary aromas are from the grapes. So a Sauvignon Blanc will smell like gooseberries or grass. Secondary aromas come from the winemaking process, and reactions with yeast and bacteria. So the buttery smell in Chardonnay comes from a type of bacteria. Tertiary aromas are from the ageing process - thatrsquos what gives Champagne its nutty flavour.TASTECoat your mouth with a large sip followed by smaller sips. Sloosh it around in your mouth and draw air in through your teeth. Try to pick out at least three fruit flavours and three other flavours. You donrsquot need to spit wine out.Think about the basic tastes of wine. Sweetness is at the front of the mouth. Acidity makes your mouth water. Tannin dries the mouth - the Wine Folly folk say itrsquos like a lsquowet teabagrsquo. Alcohol creates heat at the back of the mouth.Wine lsquoevolvesrsquo on your palate. A Syrah, for example, tastes very strong for a short period of time. A Cabernet Sauvignon builds on the palette and then fades gradually. A Pinot Noir is subtle, never overpowering the mouth and has a long finish - meaning the taste lingers over time.CONCLUDEThis is where you begin to build your expertise. Was the wine balanced  Did one flavour overpower another Think about the key traits of the wine and keep them in your memory to use when tasting other wines.Try blind tasting with friends - and see how you all react to each wine.Start with single-ietals - thatrsquos one type of grape such as a Chardonnay or a Merlot - so you can work out how each grape tastes.Try the same grape but from dferent regions - like France, Chile or New Zealand.Be honest - decide what type of wine you like, not what type of wine you are told you should like.Wine Folly use a four point rating system - from bleh, to meh, then yeah, and finally last meal, as in this is the wine yoursquod have with your last meal on earth.Drink sensibly."},{"url":null,"title":"experts-call-on-snp-government-to-back-5-child-benefit-rise-in-budget","story":"The experts issued their demand days after a new report revealed that nearly a quarter of a million children north of the border are in poverty.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard backed the call: \"Children living in poverty cannot wait several years for these additional funds - they need them now.\"Following the independence referendum, the cross-party Smith Commission led to Holyrood acquiring new powers over taxation and social security.Among the basket of powers given to MSPs was the ability to create new benefits and top-up existing programmes reserved to Westminster.The SNP Government has since confirmed it will introduce an income supplement by , although Ministers have yet to decide on what form it will take.According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, around one million Scots are in poverty, of which , are children.In two separate letters, a range of senior figures have called on the Government to bring forward their top-up plan by announcing an income boost in Wednesdayrsquos Budget.Their preferred option is to increase child benefit, which is currently set at pound. a week for the first child, by pound, in line with the high-profile lsquoGive Me Fiversquo campaign.In their letter to Mackay, four senior church figures - Church of Scotland Moderator Rt Rev Susan Brown, The Most Rev Mark Strange of the Scottish Episcopal Church, Joan Cook of the Scottish Unitarian Association, and Bishop William Nolan - wrote:ldquoThere is a compelling argument to act with greater urgency in implementing the income supplement. Given the levels of poverty that currently exist in Scotland, we urge you to consider using the budget to deliver the income supplement in the next year, rather than by the current timescale of .ldquoDoing so would reflect the great need that families across Scotland must be lted out of poverty right now, rather than in several yearsrsquo time.\"They added: ldquoAs supporters of the Give Me Five campaign, we ask that ndash as well as bringing forward the delivery of the supplement ndash you also consider doing so via topping up child benefit, which would immediately lt tens of thousands of children out of poverty.In the second letter to the Finance Secretary, over twenty prominent iniduals called for child benefit to be increased.These include Satwat Rehman at One Parent Families Scotland, Children st Chief Executive Mary Glasgow, Scottish Drugs Forum CEO David Liddell, STUC General Secretary Grahame Smith, Poverty Alliance Director Peter Kelly and Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland Director John Dickie.It also included senior figures in Cranhill Development Trust, childrenrsquos charity Aberlour, Justice and Peace Scotland, Energy Action Scotland, Close the Gap and Engender.They wrote: ldquoAs a non-means tested entitlement, it [child benefit] has a high take-up rate and is less expensive to administer, and we continue to believe that topping up child benefit would represent a most effective and impactful way of delivering the new income supplement.The signatories also stated that they are ldquoseriously concerned that the  timescale for an income top up is ldquonot reflective of the urgency with which it is required.Dickie said: ldquoThese letters demonstrate the extraordinary breadth and depth of support across Scotland for an immediate boost to family incomes to help tackle the devastating hardship too many children are facing.ldquoAlong with faith groups, trade unions and childrens charities we urge the Finance Secretary to prioritise financial support for families as a matter of urgency. A pound top up to child benefit would be one way of lting thousands of children out of poverty and protecting many more from the damage poverty wreaks.The SNP has so far resisted the policy on the grounds that the payment would benefit families not in poverty.SNP Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said: ldquoScotland is the only part of the UK to have ambitious targets to reduce, and ultimately eradicate, child poverty. We are developing a new income supplement to provide additional financial support to families who need it most as research shows that topping up Child Benefit, which remains reserved to the UK Government, is not the most efficient or effective way to lt children out of poverty, nor would it be quick or simple.However, the Government is facingpolitical pressure to back the pound a week increase, as the Greens and Scottish Labour are in favour of the move.Leonard said: \"This is a hugely signicant intervention in the budget debate by faith leaders, charities, anti-poverty campaigns and the STUC uniting to call for Scotlands powers to be used in the interests of the many, not the few.\"Derek Mackay must listen to these church leaders, charities and Labour and raise Child Benefit by pound per week in his budget on Wednesday.\"This would lt around , children out of poverty and help families across Scotland.\"Scottish Greens MSP Alison Johnstone said: \"Topping up Child Benefit was a Green manesto proposal that would lt thousands of families out of poverty.

The issue was highlighted in the Courier of November  and Highland Council made aware of the most recent spate of vandalism in which first-floor windows were broken.A former janitor had confronted boys throwing stones at the windows and had previously alerted police when he saw people walking about on the roof of the former technical department.Speaking about her efforts to make the building safe, Councillor Sinclair said: \"I first asked for this work to be done several months ago but officers in every department are very stretched both for time and money, so I am pleased that the work has finally been completed and thank the people involved, both council and contractor.\"However, she stressed that it was only a \"small step forward\" and that it should \"not take elected members months of asking to have this small amount of work done\".She said: \"The council as a whole needs to consider whether it has become so bureaucratic and centralised that it effectively disempowers its own members. I hope our new chief executive will take radical steps to shake things up and deliver the localism we have been promised.\"She went on to say how she is now considering a motion to the council that commits it to having a better-planned exit strategy for its estates. \"Too many town centres are falling into a state of terrible decline,\" Councillor Sinclair said. \"Often that is to do with market forces and therefore beyond our control, but when its council land contributing to that decline we have a responsibility to address it.\"A council spokesperson said: \"The property was boarded up to try and prevent further vandalism.\"Initially we boarded up all the ground-floor windows and doors on all the buildings. However, more recently windows on the higher first floor were also damaged.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out.

A BBC radio presenter hanged herself in her loft shortly after coming off-air in the middle of her show following an ongoing battle with depression, an inquest heard.Vicki Archer, , was found dead at home by her step-father just hours after leaving a radio station part through her afternoon slot - telling colleagues she was “upset”.The mum-of-three had been co-hosting the -pm BBC Radio Shropshire show with Adam Green when she abruptly went off the air shortly before pm.An inquest heard how she told BBC colleagues she needed “a break” before she ed to her home on Woodcote Way, in Shrewsbury, Shrops.Her step-father Lee Holyoake, , discovered Vicki’s leless body at around .pm after he went round to fix her cooker along with he -year-old mum Beryl.He climbed in through an open window after getting no answer when he tried knocking the door and performed CPR until paramedics arrived.Tragically, nothing could be done to save the popular broadcaster and she was pronounced dead at .pm.Shropshire Coroners Court heard orced Vicki had made two previous attempts to take her le and had suffered from depression.In the days leading up to her death, she had retweeted posts about inner demons and mental health issues.She also shared links to the Samaritans’ hotline number and wrote about “hurtful gossip” saying: “Gossip is rarely kind, positive or encouraging.“It’s corrosive, hurtful and normally has nothing to do with you.“You don’t need to be part of it. Say no thanks and move away.” - Hollywood star Tilda Swinton battles locals over plans for her Highland homeTodayShropshire Coroner John Ellery concluded Vicki died as a result of suicide.He said: “Victoria had made two previous attempts to take her own le in the past and suffered from depression.“Victoria left her radio show in mid-air and she said she was going for a break.“My conclusion is Victoria did do the act that led to her death.“She intended to kill herself, and that leads me to the inevitable conclusion of suicide.“This is a tragic case for her family and our condolences are and must be with her children.”The a statement read to the court, Mr Holyoake described the heartbreaking moment he found his step-daughter’s body.He said: “At approximately pm on August , [Vicki’s mother] Beryl and I called at her house to give her a necklace. I was gong to fix the cooker.“Beryl said she was eating well and she appeared her usual chatty self.“She is a radio presenter and she is at work from .pm to pm.“I made arrangements to fix her cooker while she was at work.“We left and at .pm and I went back to her house.“When I was approaching the house, I saw a female approach her driveway.“She had white hair and a long dress, similar to Victoria.“As I was driving past the house I saw the back of the person going towards the door.“When I was approaching the house I was expecting to see the person at the door.“I found the key was missing from the key safe by the door.“I knocked the door and there was no reply. - Irvine Welsh’s Edinburgh housing estate to host pop-up book festival“I started to get annoyed because the person who went into the house did not come.“I phoned my we to let her know. I did not see Victoria’s car on the drive.“I went back to our house and picked up my we. We went to Radio Shropshire.“One of Victoria’s colleagues told me Victoria had left work at pm and said she was feeling upset and would be in work tomorrow.“Alarm bells started to ring.“Victoria has made two previous attempts to take her own le and suffers from depression.“We went to her house and continued to try and raise her by banging the doors and windows but there was still no reply.“We had tohome and I went alone back to her house with a key for her door.“I saw Victoria’s car parked on Buttington Road. This is unusual as she normally parks on the driveway.“I couldn’t get the key into the door because there was a key on the other side.“I noticed Victoria’s bedroom window was open and I managed to get a ladder from one of her neighbours.“I got in through the bedroom window.“There were no signs of forced entry in the house. I searched the house and garden but could not find her.“I called my we to come and assist me. She said to check the loft.“I went to the top of the stairs and the loft hatch was closed as normal.“As I checked the right hand side of the loft, I saw Victoria in the corner.“I went downstairs to phone an ambulance. I also asked for police.“The emergency services operator started to give me instructions to do cardiopulmonary resuscitation .“As I did this, the ambulance arrived.“The paramedic pronounced le extinct when he arrived.”A statement from PC Matthew Bourne, of West Mercia Police, said: “At .pm on August  there was a report from a man who had found his daughter hanging in the attic.“When we arrived there was a distressed female who I now know is Beryl Holyoake.“Lee Holyoake was in a distressed state, attempting CPR on a female.“She was on her back.“I could see the female was not moving.“The paramedic pronounced le extinct at .pm.“Shropshire Fire and Rescue attended to remove the body.”The inquest heard Vicki had a blood alcohol level slightly over the drink drive limit as well as some traces of medication in her blood.But the post-mortem examination suggested alcohol and drugs did not play a part in her death.Dr Joanna Stafford, who carried out the post mortem at Royal Shrewsbury Hospital on August , said: No alcohol or drugs were implicated in the death.“The cause of death was hanging.”A statement released by Vicki’s family said: “We still cannot believe that Vicki’s not here.“Her zest for le was infectious, she was a wonderful mother and daughter and her charm brought a smile to all those who knew her.“She could light up a room.“While we will always miss her we want to remember and celebrate everything that she achieved which is why in the spring we are planning a memorial celebration of her le.“But in the meantime we want to thank everyone for their support and kindness helping us through our immeasurable loss.”Gavin Hogarth, Vicki’s ex-husband and the father of her children, attended the inquest but did not wish to comment outside court.David Jennings, Head of the BBC’s regional programmes, West Midlands, said in a statement afterwards: “We are heartbroken at Vicki’s death.“Everyone here at Radio Shropshire respected her as a great presenter and journalist, but so much more than that we loved the sense of fun she brought to her shows and the station.“Her loss leaves a huge void.

It will also have “black start” ability, meaning it can immediately begin producing powerthere is a sudden shutdown of supply.The two new proposed developments will be even more powerful than Red John – MW at Loch Tay and MW at Loch Awe.The three ILI schemes are part of a total .GW of new pumped storage hydro in development across the UK, all of it in Scotland except a MW scheme in Wales.There are already two pumped storage hydro plants operating north of the border – the MW Cruachan “hollow mountain”, near Dalmally in Argyll, and the MW Loch Mhòr, at Foyers in Inverness-shire.The technology has been around for more than a century but industry experts believe the modern schemes could be a game-changer in the move to green power.The main drawback of renewable energy schemes such as wind farms is intermittency of supply – they cannot generate power when the wind doesn’t blow. Conversely, turbines often need switched off when winds are strong but demand is low.Pumped storage has been hailed as the “holy grail” in the quest for energy security.“Pumped storage is still quite under-recognised,” said Mark Wilson, chief executive of ILI. “It’s just not out there – nobody has shone a torch on it. But it’s so simple. When you don’t need power, or when power’s cheap or would go to waste, you use it. “Millions of pounds a year is wasted on curtailment payments when turbines are switched off. Rather than doing that you can use the wind energy to power the water back up the hill to the top reservoir. So you are mitigating against curtailment wastages. “Then, when power is required at peak times, you just let the water go back down to the bottom reservoir – it goes through the turbines, creates energy and powers the system. That happens all day every day.“Pumped storage is completely efficient. It’s clean. It gives energy security because you’re not having to import gas from Europe. The energy is always there to be able to store it. That’s why they call it the holy grail.”Scotland’s climate and landscape make it well suited for pumped storage hydro.Fabrice Leveque, senior policy manager at industry organisation Scottish Renewables, said: “Scotland’s plentul rainfall often dampens spirits but it acts as one of the country’s best renewable energy resources, utilised by one of our most popular, well-established green energy technologies – hydro.“Scotland’s geography provides many suitable locations for large pumped storage hydro schemes so it’s excellent to see such a strong pipeline of projects on the horizon.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4841384.1544295253!/image/image.jpg","title":"dani garavelli end of the line for sorry scotrail strategy","story":"It#s quite creative,self-defeating, for ScotRail to turn itself into some kind of metaphor for the Tory government#s handling of Brexit. Here we are in a state of crisis # trains cancelled, poor communication and a dearth of trained staff # and how does it behave  It tries to sht the blame while promising customers that out of chaos will emerge a strong and stable # sorry, I mean much-enhanced # service for commuters.Scotland’s railways have been failing for a long time. Google “ScotRail” and “mayhem” and there will be no shortage of hits. Whether it’s Storm Ali or engineering works or a lack of locomotives, the company always seems to have an excuse – and an alternative bus service – for passengers stranded in the middle of nowhere.It would be a rare and lucky traveller who has never had cause to moan about some aspect of their rail journey . The experience is frequently blighted by overcrowding, delays, poor wi-fi and, most particularly, a lack of forward-planning that means every summer the Edinburgh Festival seems to take the company by surprise. Most mornings, Twitter is full of complaints logged under the hashtag #ScotFail and though those who man ScotRail’s account are adept at defusing anger, they can’t mask the overall impression of inadequacy.When Humza Yousaf was Transport Secretary it seemed asthings could only get better yet under Michael Matheson, they have got worse. In October, the company was fined £, for failing to meet required standards for station toilets, ticket machines, train seats, train toilets and cleanliness. And a few weeks ago, ScotRail Alliancerecorded its worst punctuality figures in  years.Like Theresa May, all ScotRail’s underlying problems seemed to come to a head last week when it lost any semblance of control over the service it is paid to deliver. Every day, dozens of trains were being cancelled with little warning, leaving commuters unable to get to and from work. Packed to overflowing, Glasgow’s Queen Street station was transformed into a page from Where’s Wally  The Fe Circle became the Fth Circle of Hell.ScotRail fell back on the “jam tomorrow” defence. It said its problems had been exacerbated by staff training being carried in advance of timetable changes that would usher in a brave new world later today. Coming hot on the heels of a price hike announcement, this promise of a shiny, happy future was met, not with cheering and the waving of flags, but by the kind of incredulous expression Carolyn Wilson, director of the Foreign Office recently wore as Boris Johnson flaunted his ignorance in advance of a meeting with their counterparts in France.It is true, of course, that not every aspect of the ongoing debacle is ScotRail’s fault. Often the delays are caused by signalling or track problems, both of which are Network Rail’s responsibility. The company has also been plagued by issues with suppliers, such as the late delivery of the new Hitachi trains which are supposed to cut the journey times between Glasgow and Edinburgh and the refurbishment of  old InterCity trains, the first  of which start running today. Three of the Hitachi trains were withdrawn from service for a short period almost immediately after they were introduced because of faults with the brake control system and the “refurbished” InterCity trains have been left with old-fashioned slam-doors and toilets which flush directly on to the track.Recent delays have been exacerbated by a row over pay and conditions which saw drivers refusing to work overtime . Then again, neither the company nor the government has done much to alleviate passengers’ travails or instil consumer confidence that the situation is likely to improve. ScotRail often seems downright blasé about the resentment building up among frequent travellers whose lives are affected by its unreliability.Indeed it chose last week, when it was barely operating a service at all, to announce that its popular Kids Go Free promotion – which allows adults to take up to two children for free injourneys – was being scrapped. Instead children will be charged a flat rate of £, which seems at odds with trying to get more people off the roads.As for the Scottish government: when it gave Dutch state-owned company Abellio the -year contract to run the franchise back in , it described the deal as “world-leading”. Having set the parameters for the £ billion contract – it cannot shrug off all responsibility.As far back as , petitions were already being raised against the company. Yet the SNP has bent over backwards to defend Abellio ScotRail in the face of its poor performance. After the release of the latest dreadful punctuality figures, Matheson agreed to waive the operator’s performance benchmarks until June , a move the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association described as a “carte blanche to fail”. This despite the fact that in   it received £min direct government funding, and the SNP has the right to end the contract at the halfway pointit is not meeting a high enough standard.Much hangs on what happens today. If the new timetables are rolled out smoothly then perhaps the company will have bought itself a reprieve. But– as seems more likely – the service continues to be beset by delays and glitches, then there must be action.Scottish Labour has called for a freeze on fares in this week’s budget. While this would be justied and might focus minds, it is dficult to see how it would resolve broader problems with the service.A better solution – also backed by Scottish Labour – might be to bring the franchise back into the public sector . According to one report by think tank Common Weal, allowing operating profits to be reinvested could produce a better service and create a lower, fairer fare regime. But fixing the system depends on Network Rail raising its game too thus, pushing for the devolution of responsibilities for the development, design and delivery of Scottish infrastructure projects to Holyrood must be a priority.If the SNP wants to tout the country’s rail service as world-leading, then it really has to get a firm grip on the companies delivering it. Until it does, it will remain more Trumpton than Tokyo. ©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4841390.1544350945!/image/image.jpg","title":"euan mccolm charlatans on both sides of brexit debate deceive the public","story":"In my daydreams, there#s a special place in Hell set aside for politicians who claim their remarks have been taken out of context. Theirs is the cowards# defence, the weasel-worded response of the well and truly bang-to-rights.No decent person in public le, so far as I can recall, has ever used this line. Rather, it is the last refuge of the charlatan.When a politician says their words have been taken out of context, what they mean is they realise their words show them up to be the terrible person they are. These people never offer the correct “context” for their words because they are bullshitting. Their words were always taken perfectly in context.Which brings me neatly to former Secretary of State for International Development, Priti Patel, the latest unspeakable toerag to drop the context bomb.It emerged on Friday that Patel, a Brexiteer of the killer robot iety, had suggested the possibility of food shortages in Ireland following a no deal departure from the EU should have been used as leverage to encourage the Irish government to drop support for a backstop plan.Given the often dark history between Britain and Ireland, the very idea that our government might effectively threaten their Dublin counterparts with food shortages is especially nauseating. It’s a suggestion that reveals a uniquely unpalatable blend of cynicism and insensitivity. And there is no context in which this would not be so.Later on Friday, Patel tweeted: “It is clear my comments on ‘No Deal’ have been taken out of context by some. We should go back to Brussels  get a better deal. There is still time. Let’s take back control of borders, laws  money.”Anyone wondering in what context these remarks should have been seen was to be left guessing by Patel, who offered no clarication. Instead, she indulged the fantasy of the grters and spivs behind the Leave campaign that the EU would offer the UK a more beneficial dealonly the UK would demand it.This supremely arrogant notion, the idea that a puffed-up little UK – a UK made smaller still by their actions – could dictate termsonly more of us “believed” in Brexit, remains popular with hardcore Eurosceptics.Patel and her fellow travellers – failed former Brexit secretaries David Davis and Dominic Raab, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, the ludicrous back-bencher Jacob Rees-Mogg, for example – sustain themselves with a fantasy that the draft agreement struck between Prime Minister Theresa May and the EU could have been made stronger through the power of self-belief.It was always the case that the UK was going to be at a disadvantage in Brexit negotiations. We never had cards worth playing. The EU – as is its duty – has moved forward in such a way that the unique benefits of membership are protected. The very idea that we would be afforded some of those benefits from the outside was always a nonsense and no amount of interventions of the “we should have demanded more” iety can change that.Whenever the downside of their case was pointed out in the run-up to the  vote, Brexiteers parroted the line, favoured by Alex Salmond and those he led in the  Scottish independence referendum campaign, that such claims were a strategy of “project fear”. It didn’t matter how compelling the evidence, any suggestion that leaving the EU might not be entirely painless was grandly dismissed. It wasn’t that their case was flawed, it was that their opponents wished to terry the people with a campaign of lies.This project fear garbage continues, even as the EU – through the limited agreement it is willing to strike – shows us that many of the warnings given have turned out to be quite correct.May presses on, trying to build support in Westminster for a deal that will satisfy neither the hardline Eurosceptic Little Englanders of Brexit nor the majority of MPs who backed Remain in .The arrogance of Brexiteers who think the UK can, as Boris Johnson once said, have cake and eat cake has echoes in the position adopted by a cross-party group of MPs that the UK should leave the EU but join Norway in a free trade area inside the European single market.You’ll simply never guess – it turns out that the UK is in no position to demand that, either.Senior political and business figures in Norway have made that abundantly clear.The so-called Norway-plus plan, which would require the UK to seek to join the European Free Trade Area group, consisting of Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein, is already dead.On Friday, Heidi Nordby Lunde, an MP in Norway’s governing Conservative party, and leader of Norway’s European movement, was refreshingly blunt.“Really,’ she said, “the Norwegian option is not an option. We have been telling you this for one and a half years since the referendum… so I am surprised that after all these years it is still part of the grown-up debate in the UK.”Nordby Lunde added: “You just expect us to give you an invitation rather than consider whether Norway would want to give you such an invitation. It might be in your interest to use our agreement, but it would not be in our interest.”All of the alternatives to the PM’s draft deal being suggested by senior politicians are non-starters because, simply, they would require other nations to weaken their own positions.That’s not to say that May’s plan holds much appeal. It is simply the case that it really is the only deal on the table. Anyone who suggests otherwise is \u2028using the “project total bullshit” playbook.No amount of bluff and bluster, whether it’s the suggestion we should demand the Norwegians let us into their club or the horric idea that we should threaten Ireland with the prospect of food shortages, can change the fact that Brexiteers’ greatest achievement is the humiliating diminishment of the United Kingdom.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4841457.1544351729!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit scots prefer independence to no deal poll finds","story":"Scots prefer independence to a no deal Brexit by a margin of three to two, a new poll suggests.Voters also believe independence would be better than a negotiated Brexit settlement.

A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh #  she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady.

Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27508  ","story":" Síle DarraghWhen young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this state, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8726164.1543838961!/image/image.jpg","title":"five fun festive events for the whole family this christmas","story":"With so much to see and do this festive season, it can be hard to decide what to prioritise.

This puts the whole of the United Kingdom in prime position to seize new opportunities as we leave the EU.As we establish our new relationship with Europe, the Industrial Strategy will help us to build the foundations behind our withdrawal agreement. Our prosperity and ability to build a strong economy is dependent on how we encourage innovation, develop high quality jobs and skills, and support businesses throughout the UK to thrive and grow.Northern Ireland has a world-leading reputation in key sectors, including construction and automotive, as well as future industries such as Articial Intelligence , cyber security and le sciences.The Industrial Strategy has led to specic partnerships between the government and these industries, which will help these major employers in Northern Ireland face the future outside the EU with confidence.Today I am pleased to announce, with the Business Secretary Greg Clark, £, of funding from the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund for the County Antrim-based le sciences company Randox. This will pay for the research and development of cutting-edge technology to enable diagnostic tools to be manufactured more quickly and effectively.Eventually, this will lead to more manufacturing jobs as a result.Northern Ireland is also benefiting from UK-wide funding programmes under the Industrial Strategy, including Armagh City, Banbridge  Craigavon who have successfully bid for £.m and Belfast for £.m as some of the  areas benefiting from the £m Full Fibre Networks Challenge fund, designed to increase connectivity across the UK.The UK has a strong economy, with eight straight years of economic growth, over  million more people in jobs, and higher employment and lower unemployment in every region and nation of the UK - we should be proud of this.We are open and enterprising, founded on invention, innovation and competition.In Northern Ireland, employment levels are almost at a record high, and the UK government is determined to build on this progress.We are at the forefront of scientic invention because we embrace change and use regulation to stimulate an environment for creativity.We have globally admired universities and research institutions, such as Queens and Ulster University, because we have nurtured our intellectual powerhouses with public investment. And we have a deserved reputation for being a dependable and confident place to do business because we have high standards, clear regulation and great partnerships.The UKs businesses can take on the world because they have access to a skilled workforce and modern infrastructure, and Northern Ireland is an important and growing part of that. The Prime Minister, the rest of our Cabinet colleagues and I will continue working to secure the best Brexit deal for the whole of the UK.At the same time we are delivering our long-term plan to support businesses throughout the UK to thrive and grow.Building on the great strides the Industrial Strategy has already taken so that after we leave the EU, our businesses and institutions are in the best possible position to build on our strengths and lead the world.Karen Bradley MP is Secretary of State for Northern Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"suzanne breen unionists united in opposition as remainers rally around backstop","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Unlike the pro-Remain parties, there was no joint press conference. But in separate statements, the DUP, the Ulster Unionists and the TUV insisted that no unionist worth their salt could sign up to the deal and called for the backstop to be binned. Sometimes, a secret document doesnt live up to the speculation. This was not such an occasion.Geoffrey Coxs advice set off alarm bells in even moderate unionist circles. No wonder the Government wanted to keep it under wraps. It said the whole of the UK would form a single customs territory with the EU, but Northern Ireland and Britain would be there on dferent legal terms.Only Northern Ireland would be legally part of the customs union, following the full EU customs code. The European Court of Justice would continue to have jurisdiction over its compliance with those rules. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: \"Goods passing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to a declaration process.\"Northern Ireland will remain in the single market for goods and the EUs customs regime, and will be required to apply and comply with the relevant rules and standards,up regulatory ergence in the future.\"Britain would be \"essentially treated as a third country by Northern Ireland for goods passing from GB into NI\".The DUP is livid that despite all Mrs Mays pledges, economic and trade barriers would be erected within the UK - something it branded \"unacceptable and economically mad\". The legal advice said the backstop could continue indefinitely and that the drafting didnt provide for a mechanism that is likely to allow the UK to exit lawfully.Despite promises to the contrary from Mrs May and Secretary of State Karen Bradley, the TUV said Northern Ireland would be \"annexed permanently into the EU\".The Attorney Generals full advice, released yesterday, was \"more emphatic and plain than that dressed up for the summary\" in the House of Commons on Monday, Mr Allister said.\"The trap is clear. All of the UK for now is held in a customs territory with the EU but only Northern Ireland is legally part of the EU Customs Union, where we would stay indefinitely evenGB was released,\" he added.\"This is utterly incompatible with the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK.\"Mrs May had previously stated the very arrangement that she ended up signing up to would be unacceptable to any UK Prime Minister.Mr Swann said while the Government tried to downplay unionist concerns as recently as last week when he met the Prime Minister and Cabinet Office officials, legal advice reinforcing those fears was actually sitting on their desks.\"What was the point in them spending the best part of a year saying that they shared our concernsall the while they were negotiating a deal that contains everything we were concerned about \" he asked.The UUP leader said Mrs May must stop \"flogging this dead deal\" and pursue alternatives. But nationalist parties and Alliance want her to do nothing of the sort. Sinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy said the backstop had been agreed by the Government and the EU, and the Attorney Generals advice changed nothing. \"It must be maintained and protected. It cant be derailed or undermined by the votes of Brexiteer MPs,\" he stressed.An SDLP spokesperson added: \"There will potentially be minor dferences between GB and NIthe backstop is required, but they will be minimal.\"This is not a secret, but any ergence is a consequence of Brexit and the extreme version of Brexit that the DUP insisted on pursuing. If the DUP cannot accept this consequence of Brexit, they should do the honourable thing and support a referendum on the deal.\"Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said nobody should be shocked at the legal advice on the backstop, because \"its nature and purpose should have been evident to anyone following the negotiations over the past  months\".The backstop was needed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to avoid a hard border, he insisted. Mr Farry didnt see it undermining the Union - it \"may create comparative economic advantages for this region\", he said."},{"url":null,"title":"huge boost for city centre as primark gets ready to open its doors again","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Rather than taking back control, under the Prime Ministers Withdrawal Agreement, the United Kingdom would be trapped..pushThe Northern Ireland Protocol, set in international law, could not be exited unilaterally by the United Kingdom.It would continue indefinitely until superseded by another agreement.The Attorney Generals legal opinion is a devastating blow for the Prime Minister and those Cabinet ministers who are trying to sell the Withdrawal Agreement as a good deal.The publication of the legal opinion is a clear vindication for those of us who campaigned for it to be published.It is regrettable that we needed to use the Contempt mechanism to secure its publication. It did not need to be this way.Nonetheless, we now fully understand why the Government did not want to publish the Attorney Generals legal opinion.It flies in the face of what the Prime Minister told us on February  in the House of Commons.She said: \"The draft legal text that the Commission has published would,implemented, undermine the UK common market and threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish sea, and no UK Prime Minister could ever agree to it.\"I will be making it crystal clear to President Juncker and others that we will never do so.\"Yet the Attorney Generals advice to the Cabinet confirms that the Northern Ireland Protocol would mean very dferent trading arrangements for Northern Ireland than the rest of the United Kingdom.A customs and regulatory border is precisely what the Government now propose.The Prime Ministers public and private commitments lie in tatters.Of course, it is important to rewind  months. It was this week last year when Arlene Foster telephoned the Prime Minister while she was in Brussels and urged her to bin the backstop.We pointed out the folly of the arrangement. We insisted on Paragraph  being added to the Joint Report to safeguard frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.Twelve months later, the Withdrawal Agreement has hundreds of detailed legal clauses about the Northern Ireland situation and the backstop, but there is not a single line and not a single word in relation to paragraph  of the Joint Report.That provision was inserted specically to allow that the final say in and decision on any regulatory dferences between Great Britain and Northern Ireland should rest with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive.It is deeply regretful that we have received no satisfactory explanation as to why Paragraph s commitment has been deleted.Conceding a fallback position to the EU before even starting talks about our final exit arrangements was always a bad idea.Too much time has been spent on negotiating this awful backstop. Even the ministers selling the deal dont like it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, said on ITVs Peston on November : \"I dont think this backstop is a good arrangement for our economy. I dont think it is a good arrangement for our Union.\"So, its bad for the economy and the Union.And then the Attorney General, the Rt Hon Geoffrey Cox MP, said in the House of Commons on December : \"It has unattractive and unsatisfactory elements for us. I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination in the backstop. I would have preferred to have seen a clause that allowed us to exit.\"The words of the Prime Minister, EU commissioners and Cabinet ministers will come and go.They can be twisted and contorted to mean whatever one wants them to mean, but the legally binding text of the Withdrawal Agreement will remain.Our grandchildren will live with the outworkings of that international agreement.The Withdrawal Agreement will commit Northern Ireland to large swaths of EU single market rules for goods and agri-food.Of course, there are already regulatory dferences between GB and NI, but those were set for health reasons by our Parliament or NI Assembly, not because we were in a dferent single market regime.In such circumstances, our core industries would have their rules set by the European Commission and be subject to the European Court of Justice, yet we would have no say over them.It is utterly unacceptable, to me as a unionist, that Northern Ireland, in trade terms, would treat the rest of the United Kingdom as a third country.The Attorney General has confirmed this as being his legal opinion.We were told by the Prime Minister in her six declarations to the people of Northern Ireland last December that she would ensure that Northern Ireland left the European Union with the rest of the United Kingdom.She assured the public that no part of the United Kingdom would be left in the single market or the customs union and that no part of the UK would be left subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.These pledges have now been broken.We want a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom and delivers on the referendum result.We want Parliament to be sovereign for the entire United Kingdom.Rather than go through the process of debating and voting on this flawed deal, the Prime Minister should work for a better deal and bin the backstop.Nigel Dodds is the DUP MP for North Belfast"},{"url":null,"title":"rivals clash in tv brexit debate ahead of commons showdown","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Who do you agree with  #CBrexit pic CMUcZwlqgw— Channel December , Mr Cleverly said: “Our deal delivers on what people voted for.

Now Theresa May has said one thing and come back with a deal that does another.”Shadow international trade secretary Mr Gardiner said Mrs May had “brought back a deal that even her closest allies think would damage the UK”.“Labour would negotiate a permanent customs union, a strong single market deal that protects workers’ rights and environmental standards,” he said.“People voted to leave, but they voted for a better future.”.@JamesCleverly tells @CarolineLucas that she voted for a referendum and that a second vote is a betrayal of trust. #CBrexit pic xJfUgHP— Channel December , Ms Lucas said Labour’s position was “fantasy land” and argued: “This decision can’t be left to the politicians, we simply can’t agree.”She said viewers would be “screaming at the television in despair” at the MPs.“We are going to have to live with the consequences of this decision for decades to come and it will affect young people most of all,” she said.“So let’s just be sure: let’s vote on this together as a country, don’t leave it to the Westminster elite to decide for you.”People voted for Brexit and it should be delivered. @Jacob_Rees_Mogg questions whether \"politicians will do what they promised\" in his opening speech. #CBrexit pic BrKvWChe— Channel December , Mr Rees-Mogg called it a “losers’ vote” and asked: “If you get a second vote and lose that, how long will it be before you ask for the third ”But Ms Lucas shot back that in  Mr Rees-Mogg had suggested “it might make more sense to have the second referendum after the renegotiation is completed” – comments made in reference to David Cameron’s renegotiation with Brussels."},{"url":null,"title":"top eu diplomat said northern ireland the price to pay for brexit claims former minister","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Raab served as Brexit secretary for four and a half months, taking over David Davis, before resigning last month in protest at the deal reached between Theresa Mays Government and Brussels. \"You would hear swirling around in Brussels - particularly the people around Selmayr, Martin Selmayr in the Commission, and some others - that losing Northern Ireland was the price the UK would pay for Brexit,\" said Mr Raab. \"This was reported to me through the diplomatic channel. \"It is one thing to defend your interests robustly, but there is another thing in the spirit of so-called European unity to be trying to carve up a major European nation. \"And it is deeply recklessyou look at the Europeans own interests… look at Catalonia, look at the seperatist tendancies across Europe. Look at Belgium. This kind of stuff looks like politics, a very narrow politics trumping the European, let alone the UK interest.\" A controversial figure, Martin Selmayr has been the Secretary-General of the European Commission since March of this year. Nicknamed the monster by his boss Jean-Claude Juncker, the EUs ombudsman issued a damning verdict in September on the manner in which his appointment was made, with the EUs Ombudsman Emma OReilly saying the process \"stretched and possibly even overstretched the limits of the law\".

To work so hard to organise this event and support fellow kidney patients is magnicent.ldquoAll their hard work and attention to detail certainly paid off and it was wonderful to be with them on the day to help out and see this couples infectious enthusiasm in action.ldquoOn behalf of Kidney Care UK I thank them for their hard work and efforts to rally so many people to support a cause which touches the lives of so many.Thanking Stephen and Christine on behalf of Northern Ireland Kidney Patients Association, William Johnston said: ldquoIt was lovely to get the chance to join with Stephen and Christine in the beautul setting of Castle Ward and to see their enthusiasm for supporting our cause and delivering and Organ Donation message of hope.ldquoI want to say a special word of thanks to them for really pulling out the stops to put together an amazing event to help local kidney patients and their families..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Campaign to clamp down on dog fouling  ","story":"LOCAL council officials have unveiled a new campaign aimed at helping rid the district of its dog fouling problem.It is a particularly contentious issue and one of the single most complained about problems in the area and, despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed and there is virtually no town or village not affected by it.This week, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has launched a new awareness campaign to remind dog owners about the importance of cleaning up after their dogs.Rolled out after a survey by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul found that levels of dog fouling had increased from the previous year, the local authority is determined to get a grip on the issue.One of the biggest problems the local authority has to tackle is the hardcore of dog owners who point blankly refuse to clean up after their pets.While the mindset of these particular iniduals is hard to fathom and it is concerning that they are prepared to turn a blind eye to potentially harming children who come into contact with the mess their animals leave behind, council officials hope the new campaign can change minds.Dog owners are being reminded that it is their responsibility to clean up after their dogs and that not doing so is leaving them open to an pound fine.In addition, dog owners are reminded that they are responsible for training their dogs properly to lsquodo their businessrsquo in their ownerrsquos garden where it can then be collected and placed in a black bin.Politicians have become increasingly frustrated at the blatant disregard some dog owners and ratepayers are displaying and are keen to finally address the dog fouling issue.There are a number of notable dog fouling hot spots across the district and council officials are prepared to do all they can to tackle the problem. Politicians are also conscious that dog fouling is a problem which does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.The new campaign is reminding dog owners that they should never allow their pets to foul on the street and that when out in public to carry a bag with them so they can collect dog dirt and dispose of it properly.Council chairman Mark Murnin said all councillors were unanimous in their support for the new awareness campaign.ldquoWe intend to monitor and extend this initiative over the coming months, he explained. Dog fouling is a serious matter and we need to remind dog owners that not only is it unacceptable, but also can potentially cause disease.ldquoIt is important that we develop and promote a culture of responsible dog ownership and are asking all dog owners to help us keep the parks and open spaces in the Newry, Mourne and Down area clean and welcoming for all users.As part of the new campaign, notices about dog fouling will be displayed prominently across the district to ensure that the local authorityrsquos message to pet owners is clear to all..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Campbell seals victory  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an excellent away win on the articial surface at Old Wesley as a strong second half performance was enough to get them over the line in a match strewn with penalties.lsquoHinch lost Rory Butler, James Simpson, Stuart Morrow to injury during the extremely physical encounter with Banbridge and, coupled with the unavailability of Johnny McPhillips, their midfield had to be rejigged completely with Callum McLaughlin and Robin Harte starting in the centre, outside fly half Hilton Gibbons.Tom Martin came in at lock to replace Simpson and the pack was bolstered by Tommy OrsquoHagan, who made his debut at tight head prop.

In recognition of the le-saving work, his employers named the air ambulance as its nominated recipient at the annual charity breakfast.March  began like any other for Damien but took a dramatic turn when he started his sht. His right arm became trapped above the elbow while working with heavy machinery, with the alarm quickly raised by one of his colleagues.Helicopter Emergency Medical Servicesparamedic Mike Patton was on duty when the call came through and quickly tasked the air ambulance to the accident with the crew joined at Carryduff business by the Fire and Rescue Service and Ambulance Service paramedics.Even though the builders yard was clear of obstacles, the landing proved challenging for the air ambulance due to the signicant amount of dust which was created as the helicopter came into land.Fire and Rescue Service personnel worked to release Damienrsquos arm from the machinery and were assisted by one of his colleagues who was also a former part-time firefighter and played an important supporting role during the incident.Throughout the entire ordeal, Damien remained conscious and remembers every moment right up until he was sedated mdash he believes his ldquomind blocked out the trauma.Once anaesthetised by a doctor, Damien was transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital by road ambulance, accompanied by the HEMS team, where he then underwent crucial surgery tometal plates into his arm.Damienrsquos road to recovery has been long, undergoing a further operation, overcoming two incidences of MRSA which required surgery, and a requirement for a Picc line to allow for regular antibiotic treatments by a team of dedicated rapid response nurses who called daily at his home over a period of  weeks.He is also likely to require further surgery. However, thanks to the initial care of the HEMS team, the work of the Belfast Trust and follow-up surgery, Damienrsquos arm has been saved.ldquoIt has been a long journey to recovery so far, but I have been making great progress and exceeding the expectations of my medical team, Damien confirmed.ldquoEvery week there is further improvement and we are now hopeful that I will gain % mobility in my arm. I owe so much to the air ambulance HEMS team, the Ambulance Service and Royal Victoria Hospital for my initial care and treatment.Damien has also thanked staff at the Ulster Hospital and in particular Mr Harry Lewis, consultant plastic surgeon and consultant orthopaedic surgeon, Miss Denise Shirley.He continued: ldquoI firmly believe that it was their hard work and skill that has meant my story has had a more positive outcome.ldquoSince my arm has been saved I have been able toto work which is great as it was driving me mad sitting at home. The goal I am working towards now is to get as much usage back in my arm as I physically can.Damien said the air ambulance costs pound, per day to run so every penny really does go a long way to making sure this vital service can continue.He added: ldquoI was delighted when Carryduff Building Supplies nominated the Air Ambulance to benefit from its annual fundraising breakfast. Being able to raise pound, on the day was a phenomenal achievement and is the highest amount that has ever been raised at this event. We were thrilled to be able to present this to the charity.Shirley Gilliland, who owns the Carryduff firm along with her husband John added: ldquoDamien has been part of the company for over four years and as a close team we were all gutted when the accident happened.ldquoThe speed of the response of the air ambulance and the critical interventions at the scene have clearly made a dference in Damienrsquos recovery. Wersquore so grateful to have him back on the team and doing well.ldquoWhilst you take every precaution accidents can happen and we are now very much aware of the role that the air ambulance has to play in the local community, including the impact for industry related accidents.ldquoI would urge other companies to do what they can to support the service whether that is by corporate donation or fundraising..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Great grandmother’s pens new children’s novel  ","story":"A CLOUGH woman has just published her third childrenrsquos book in a series cleverly written to capture the imagination of young readers.Eighty six year-old Maureen Donnellyrsquoa book, Five Famous Dogs of Ireland, which is illustrated by Ulster artist Susan Hughes, looks at the wealth of legends and rich folklore which has almost been forgotten today.Mrs Donnelly, whose late husband, the Rev James Donnelly, was rector of Saul and Inch Parish Churches, says she got her inspiration from a picture of her great grandson, one year-old Rory Donnelly, holding on to a fluffy teddy bear in one hand and patting the familyrsquos pet dog with the other.She said: ldquoIt struck me when I saw the photo how well children and animals get along.

His wolfhound was called Bawn and was known to be the best jumping dog in all of Ireland and could scare off the meanest of enemies.Mrs Donnelly said: ldquoI had the privilege to grow up with stories such as Bran. I loved the story so much I wrote it down back then. And Irsquom really glad I did. I came to write all the ones I could recall back then too. These tales will be sure to ignite again the imaginations of every child who reads them.No book would be complete without the tale of Setanta, the young boy who grew up to be a brave warrior. He was renowned for tackling a fierce hound with his bare hands. But feeling so bad after killing the hound, he asked the dogrsquos owner for a pup and promised he would train him up to be as good as his father.Setanta became known from that day on as Cu Chulainn mdash the Hound of Cullen.Mrs Donnelly has been instrumental in setting up a number of historical societies around Co Down.She adds: ldquoThe books are aids to help parents hand down our wealth of Irish folklore and the great legends of Ulster to another generation. So much of our heritage and culture is being lost on our young generation.ldquoThis series of books is a way for me to rescue those stories.

He doesnrsquot hog the limelight ndash in fact quite the opposite. He stays away from it. His hero status is earned, though, his earning of the status is not a deliberate focus. That is more for others to do. If we donrsquot have heroes then where do we get our inspirations from  Often our heroes are close to home, and that is true of this one.Itrsquos early summer  and an eager  year-old is anxious to know. ldquoWell, was he there  The equally eager  year-old, deciding to be a wee bit cute, replied: ldquoWho  A few playful expletives from the  year-old and the  year-old burst out laughing: ldquoAye, he was there ndash there was no county training tonight.:It was the first Town senior training session the  year-old attended. Dferent times. A  year-old nowadays would be a ball-boy at training. ldquoDid he train or was he ndash like ndash just there standing about not involved as he was on the county team A few expletives from medeclared: ldquoOf course he trained ndash hersquos Arkle the county captain, midfielder for The Town. ldquoDid he pass the ball to you and by the way hersquos a Fontenoy , the nineteen year-old declared robustly.ldquoYes he did I replied excitedly. The Town man gave me great encouragement and told me to keep coming back to training. He is our hero. Hersquos everyonersquos hero. I will come back to our nineteen-year old later.Over  Gaels from Down, all over Ireland and beyond gathered in the Slieve Donard Hotel last Friday night to honour and to pay tribute to one of Downrsquos greatest ever footballers, none other than the great Colm McAlarney.His evening started with a knock on the door at his home in the Town when club chairman, Kevin Sweeney, and event organiser Kevan Owens surprised Colm in his kitchen with those immortal words ldquotonight Colm ndash this is your le.It was filmed and the first sign of his hero status became apparent ndash total shock and his humble disbelief. Then came his sudden realisation of what the meaning of the word lsquoOmertarsquo was ndash the code of silence.He didnrsquot see it coming or expect it. Colm arrived into the Shimna Suite to a tumultuous welcome ndash the sort of welcome only heroes get, the standing ovation, the shy bow of the head and of course the irreplaceable smile.He was among friends and worshippers. He spoke to his adoring audience and we lapped up every word. He spoke of his unease at the inidual honours he achieved as Gaelic football is a team game and that he achieved much on the shoulders of giants both in size and sheer ability. They gave him the  to achieve what he did.Colm said It wasnrsquot about Colm ndash itrsquos what others did for him. The unglamorous work, the blocking, the chasing ndash all the stuff we, as footballers do.The first video, mist and rolling hills ndash the early strains from the film many years ago ndash yip local hero.We all canrsquot be wrong. Wersquore all thinking the same way. In true lsquoThis is your lersquo style our compere for the evening, the classy one and only Austin OrsquoCallaghan eased Colm into his throne.He didnrsquot sit easy. Hersquos in the spotlight. Itrsquos not like the chair at home from which he was supposed to be watching the Late Late Show . As Colm said himself, before Mickey Cole got his tuppence in, saying it was about Colmrsquos level of viewing.There was laughter from the hall. Now, like all his years on the field, he is being watched once again. The evening will unfold. There will be surprises. He will forget himself, the nervous tension will go.He will relax into the throne ndash on one which he will wear a virtual crown. There was one thing missing ndash the big red book. This was duly delivered by Colmrsquos grandchildren, Eimear and Senan adorned in the Castlewellan and Liatroim Fontenoys colours.He got his biggest hug of the night from them. They probably whispered lsquowe love you grandarsquo to him. He would have known that.And so the story of his le began and it began with family. His sisterrsquos Mary, Nuala, Una and Dympna talked warmly of their brother. They spoke of the early days in Dublin, the near emigration to Australia and ultimately theirto Liatroim.In later years one newspaper headlined ldquoColm McAlarney ndash Dublinrsquos gt to Downrsquo ndash which we all know now is so fitting and thank God for that.The next sign of the hero status revealed itself though not a sporting one. Dympna told of how as a four year-old she misbehaved at Mass. As children wersquove all got the ldquowait until I get you home remark from a parent. When she got home, Colm being the big brother. gave her a big protective hug and all was forgiven by her parents.Stories of his early playing days were laid out by his friends Tommy Armstrong, Brian Malone, Gerry and Noel McCabe.Those days as young lads where they played in a field, set up goals and the youngesttold they were in goal. The humorous story of those times set the evening up well.We also heard from Willie Doyle and Colm Shields of those days in the mid-sixties when the young Colm was starting to make his mark on the Gaelic field. And so the flow of old playing colleagues from St Patrickrsquos High School, Downpatrick, with MacRory Cup memories, Down Minors and U-s of the day.In  Colm played for Down in three Ulster finals in the space of eight days mdash for the seniors, minors and U-s. A quite unique feat and a sign that perhaps greater things would come.Another unique fact was revealed. Colm played in four consecutive minor county finals, one with Loughinisland, one with Annaclone and two with Castlewellan. The great and the good continued to file passed.They told their tales of opponent, rival, colleague and what makes the GAA tick ndash friendship. We all know the headline stories, but it will always be the anecdotal tales behind the stories which give us all the biggest chuckles.Of course there was the glory years where we had Paddy Doherty, Sean OrsquoNeill, Gerry Dougherty, Kevin McIlroy, Donagh OrsquoKane, Barney McAleenan, Liam Sloan, Peter McGinnity, Sean og McGourty, Ray Carolan to name but a few.The little story from Liam Sloan, when back in , he received a call from the Ulster Council to seea trophy Colm won the previous year could be ed to be presented to the next recipient. Liam called to Colmrsquos house where Colm went looking for it. Imagine the scene, Colmrsquos backside sticking out from under the stairs, arm reaching back with each trophy saying ldquodo you think itrsquos that one.There were video messages from Kevin Moran, the great Mick OrsquoDwyer, Sean Cavanagh, Mickey Harte and then of course there was Joe Brolly, who wants to sit down and have a pint with Colm sometime.Colm could turn his hand to any sport. Basketball was always a preferred past time. What was revealed also was when he was at St Josephrsquos Training College was how he became involved in a wee bit of boxing.When members of the Immaculata Boxing Club came over from Divis to lsquoThe Ranchrsquo Colm took up the gloves. They were impressed by his skills. They wanted him to join the sport and even came to watch him play.The young Colm simply did not have the time to fit it in. The one good thing was that, as many of you will remember boxing skills came in handy in the Gaelic football arena back then. Better with the skill than without it.I cannot tell everyonersquos tale but perhaps one of the greatest footballers of all time, the great Kerryrsquos Jack OrsquoShea, paid Colm the greatest of sporting accolades by telling everyone he modelled his game on Colmrsquos.The second Gaelic football, box to box player, learning from the first and had Colm been a Kerry man ndash well you know how many All-Ireland medals hersquod have. This comment met with huge applause and nodding approval for our hero.Another milestone in Colmrsquos illustrious career, sometimes forgotten, was his foresight back then in  to introduce Saturday morning coaching sessions in Castlewellan for potential footballers between six and eleven years of age, a true testimony this practice is still thriving within the club some thirty three years down the road, all due to Colm McAlarney.The most touching tribute of the night came from his daughter Grainne. Hersquos dad and not the hero we know.He is the hero that is her dad. It was only in her early twenties she appreciated the GAA star her dad is. Sometimes, whenever she mentioned her surname, through the medium of her work with Danske Bank, there was then the silence and the pause, then the question, ldquoAnything to Colm  which she would answer with pride and a smile ldquoyes thatrsquos my dad.Hersquos first and foremost a dad. Sitting quietly and elegantly through the evening, watching the proceedings unfold and Irsquom sure bursting with pride, was Theresa, Colmrsquos we. Along with the family she kept the secret of what was months in the making.Her smile and perhaps a quiet reflection on a sporting le which she supported all through the years deserves recognition. Though, I suspect she would be like Colm in that that recognition doesnrsquot sit easy with her either.The final video of the night was delivered to the tunes of My Way and Simply the Best. This was a reflection of a career which spanned four decades. Perhaps most poignant of moments was the final montage from the  Down Senior Championship final where we saw a very proud Michael McAlarney with his son Colm and Colm Og with the Frank OrsquoHare Cup he spoke of bursting with pride of the two men beside him.Colm did it his way, but never to the detriment of others and he is simply the best. All the guests rose to their feet, once again, when the red book was handed over. The evening wasnrsquot over yet. There was another award. One from within his own club. Castlewellan chairman Kevin Sweeney, came to the podium and announced that Colm was the worthy recipient of the Castlewellan Hall of Fame award.Some of our previous proud winners were there to see Colm presented the Johnny OrsquoNeill Trophy by Johnnyrsquos son, our vice-chairman, John OrsquoNeill. Colm is now among a special group of people within our club.Well done to Kevan Owens, Kevin Sweeney, Gerry Dougherty, Liam Sloan and Barney McAleenan. This is the team who put the night together and they deserve our praise and appreciation.So, there you have it - the word hero ndash you know by now itrsquos a big one.Kitty Kelley said that a hero is someone we can admire without apology. I use the word unashamedly. By the way, that  year-old I mentioned at the beginning was the late Gerry Rushfrom the Bann Road. He was a very proud Fontenoy, my friend and a McAlarney man.JR went to his eternal rest in October , but his spirit was there on Friday night to pay tribute to a very special local hero..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"McNamara and Murray strikes send Olympic into raptures  ","story":"TWO goals in a mesmeric three-minute first half spell proved decisive as Ballynahinch Olympic secured their place in the Christmas showpiece final against Crumlin Star.Strikes from Niall Murray and Chris McNamara had Olympic purring, but they took their foot off the gas after the break and nearly threw it all away.Orangefield huffed and puffed for most of the second half, but a determined Olympic restricted them to a solitary strike from Vitalis Ogunwa in the th minute.There wasnrsquot much to write home about in the opening exchanges, but Olympic looked the more comfortable in possession with their fluid and ambitious -- formation.Orangefield had the first shot in anger when William Gracey had a shot from the edge of the box well blocked by the impressive Chris Magee. Owen Peden then had a header blocked as Orangefield had penalty appeals for hand ball waved away.Stuart Nelson had a shot comfortably saved by Ryan Walsh as Orangefield probed for an opening, but Olympic were nor for yielding.However, the east Belfast side committed a cardinal sin by ping their guard and affording the roaming Murray and Nathan Jones far too much space and time on the ball.Jones served notice of intent in the rd minute when he was picked out totally unmarked on the right side of the box, but he contrived to screw his shot badly wide.Three minutes Ryan Molloy instigated one of Olympicrsquos trademark moves when he released Murray. Without even having to look up to see his options, Murray immediately fed Jones, but Glenn Taylor denied him with a parried save.With  minutes gone and Olympic in the middle of a power play, Jones again found space down the right and played an angled pass in behind centre half Jonathan Doey that was latched on to by Murray and he beat Taylor all ends up with a sweet strike.It was - three minutes later. A sweeping pitch- move, started out on the left by the immaculate Dalton Tate, ended with Chris McNamara, who was involved in the build-up, converting a sublime pass from Jones.Jones could easily have made it - in the st minute, but his well-struck shot was tipped round the post by Taylor. Jones then played a brilliant ball into the path of Murray, but he was denied by an alert Taylor who rushed off his line to interceptTaylor saved from McNamara at the start of the second half, but Olympic strangely retreated into a defensive shell with Jones being starved of possession and Murray and McNamara being forced to live off crumbs.It was at this stage of the game that Ryan Noade really started imposing himself on proceedings and he revelled in providing protection to his back three with numerous, telling tackles and interceptions where it mattered.Orangefield were seeing much more of the ball, but they were never able to hurt Olympic.If anything, Olympic still carried a greater goal threat with Jones having a free kick blocked and Stevie Noade flashing one wide after Jones threaded the ball into his path.Orangefield managed to reduce the arrears in the th minute when Ogunwa beat the offside trap inside the box and drilled an unstoppable effort past Ryan Walsh.Despite applying intense pressure, Orangefield never looked like equalising and with the  minutes almost up, Olympic hit them on the break only for Murray to blast wildly over the bar with only Taylor to beat.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Chris Magee, Ryan Noade, Conor Reid, Jason Noade, Dalton Tate, Stevie Noade, Niall Murray, Nathan Jones, Ryan Molloy, Chris McNamara.

The scale of the crisis is quite simply breathtaking and the figures speak for themselves.Mr Savage said an estimated , applications had been made for social housing district-wide, with almost , of applicants placed in the urgent need category.He continued: ldquoThese figures highlight the terrible extent of the housing crisis in this district. Enough is enough, it is time for us to take action and time for everyone to put their shoulder to the wheel to tackle this mounting problem.ldquoThe conference is the first step in getting sustainable solutions at a time when the people we represent cannot get a place they can call home. The Department of Communities has an obligation to come and play a lead role because it oversees the Housing Executive and needs to hear first hand the level of need in the district and work with us all to provide collaborative solutions to the problem.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to explore all the options. Access to a home is a fundamental human right and we need to act swtly so the current generation is not left without a place to live.Cllr Billy Walker said all elected representatives are approached about the lack of social housing on a daily basis and that not one of the part of the district is not affected by the current crisis.ldquoWe need this conference to pull all the key players together and we must be robust with them on this issue. We need solutions going forward and this conference is the perfect opportunity to do just that, he added.Cllr Davy Hyland said the council needed to do what it could to find solutions for people in desperate need of housing, while Cllr David Taylor said a lack of resources was not helping the housing crisis which had left people on the waiting list for several years in some cases.He added: ldquoWe need a new social housing strategy and need all the key players to buy into this. We also need funding to meet the demand which exists.Cllr Andy McMurray said he was ldquoacutely aware of the trauma associated with being on the waiting list for social housing, describing the waiting list figures as ldquopretty shocking, while Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly suggested the social housing crisis ldquohas gone well beyond crisis point.Cllr Willie Clarke described Newcastle as a priority area and warned that the current social housing shortage has the potential to get worse in the months and years ahead.He said there is a particular need for accommodation for small families, highlighting the problems social housing providers face when they have to compete with private developers to secure building land.Cllr John Trainor said that while work on a major social housing scheme was underway at the old Downe Hospital site in Downpatrick, it was important to plan for the townrsquos needs over the next five to  years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Murlough runners in full flow  ","story":"ON a wet Saturday morning, some  Murlough AC members made their way across the province to Loughgall in Co Armagh to complete the third race in Born  Runrsquos Run Forest Run series.There is no other way to describe the day other than it chucked it down, our feet were well and truly soaked before the race began.

Children who are educated together create friendships which last for the rest of their lives, she continued.ldquoWe believe that there are more opportunities for children in integrated education which can provide them with a broader experience a safe, neutral environment where people can mix with each other and help us create a genuine, shared future for everyone.Mrs McAlpine explained the aim locally is to create the new steering group to take the post-primary project forward and write to existing controlled schools to testthey would be interested in transforming to integrated status.She said this would be a ldquofundamental change which may be dficult for some, confirming that existing schools preferred to maintain the collective status quo, the Mid Down steering group would adopt a greenfield approach for a new school.ldquoNICIE will be delighted to support parents in favour of new integrated post-primary provision as in all consciousness we cannot allow the current situation to continue as it is. You have around  children not being able to secure a post-primary place in the integrated sector and I think there is something we can do to redress the imbalance, she said.ldquoWe want to provide provide a much better future for post primary integrated education in the Mid Down area and hope to form a new steering group before Christmas and then contact controlled schools in the New Year to testthey wish to transform to integrated status.ldquoI have asked the Department of Educationwould it start a site search for me and I have an idea where a new school could be located but not a specic site. We currently have an integrated school at Blackwater in Downpatrick which I believe has never had the chance to reach its full potential as its site is quite restricted.Mrs McAlpine added: ldquoI am trying to get something that will enable us,the children would like to transfer, to get everybody on the same site and we would hope to have new post-primary integrated provision in the Mid Down area by , either in an existing school or via a new-build project..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New principal at Knockevin Special School  ","story":"THE new principal at Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick is looking forward to her new role with relish.While Sara Liddell has been acting principal since the start of the new school term, her appointment as Mrs Anne Cooperrsquos successor was only confirmedrecently and she says she is delighted to be at the helm of a school which has a special place in the heart of the community.Sara always wanted to work in special education and feels privileged to head up a school where work on a much-needed new extension is expected to start next September.The former Down High School student worked at Tor Bank Special School in Dundonald before moving to Knockevin, where she was a teacher and vice-principal for four years before taking over as principal.From Downpatrick, the new principal has a close link with Knockevin as her brother Jamie was educated at the school.ldquoI always wanted to work in special education and wanted to be here in Knockevin because it really is such a special place, said Sara. ldquoWhile I was studying at Stranmillis I did my teaching practice here which was lovely for me.ldquoThere is such warmth in the community for the school which has such a lovely, family feel about it. I obviously knew the school because Jamie came here and know how special it is. I wanted to work in special education because I saw what Jamie was able to achieve.ldquoJamie came through Knockevin and while he has his challenges, he was able to leave school and secure a job a few days a week which is great. My brother learned so much because he was educated here.ldquoThere is so much warmth about this place and I am fortunate to work with a wonderful staff team. Everyone, including pupils and families were so supportive to my family when Jamie was a pupil here. That sparked my interest in special education and was why I always wanted to work in this field, Sara explained.Knockevin is split across two sites, with an Early Years centre in Dundrum catering for  children and  pupils based in Downpatrick with a - strong teaching staff across both locations.ldquoWe are the only special school for a wide geographical area and have pupils coming from as far away as Kilkeel and Newry, with others closer to home coming from the Downpatrick, Ardglass, Strangford, Crossgar and Killinchy areas, the new principal continued.ldquoI am looking forward to my new role and already knowing the staff, pupils and families has been a big help. Knowing I have their genuine support is really wonderful.Given that it is the only special school in the local area, Knockevin is oversubscribed, with Sara explaining her appointment coincides with what she described as a ldquochallenging time.She continued: ldquoWe have a good reputation which has been enhanced with the new early years centre in Dundrum which is a real centre of excellence and we have huge numbers coming through, she continued.ldquoWe are pushed for space in Downpatrick, but Knockevin is in the school enhancement programme and work on a new extension will hopefully start next September, replacing mobile classrooms with a new permanent structure and it is a really exciting time to be part of this.Tendering documents are currently being prepared ahead of the start of building work which is expected to take  months to complete to meet what the new principal described as a ldquohuge need in the area.As Sara settles into her new role, she admits the fact she was vice-principal for four years has made the transition a smooth process.ldquoThere is so much love and warmth for the school across the community and local people are fantastic. May aim moving forward is to harness that warmth to give our pupils lots of new opportunities, she explained.ldquoWe already have a fantastic work experience programme where seniors go out and so many businesses have been so supportive. This is something I really want to build on, strengthening our school links.ldquoWe have been involved in a few projects with the Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch and St Patrickrsquos Grammar in Downpatrick which produced benefits for everyone involved. As a former Down High student I have been able to establish a link with its student council which is really beneficial.Sara believes that linking Knockevin with other schools is important as it provides young people with an insight into what a special school is ldquodemystying the issues around it. She is also pleased her students can attend other schools to use a range of specialist facilities which provide access to art and drama, science and technology in particular.ldquoIt is amazing how other schools have opened up to us.

There will also be tea and refreshments and open invitation is extended to people to attend. Organisers say the service is open to all, not just those who have a relative who took their own le.Ailish Teague, who helped establish Le Change Changes Lives with her husband, Manus, said the service will be held in the charityrsquos new home for the first time.ldquoIt is a joint service organised alongside PIPS and it will be the third we have organised. PIPS initially came up with the idea and asked could they use our new premises which we were delighted to make available, she explained.ldquoThere has been a very good response over the past two years, with the service an evening where people can join together in their grief and remember loved ones collectively. Relatives are alongside others who have experienced the same pain and there is a lot of empathy and understanding.Ailish said the service is open to people from across the district and explained that there will be an opportunity for people to place the names of their loved ones on a Christmas tree.ldquoPeople are given as much time as they need and this can, for some, be a cathartic experience. We place peoplersquos names on skeleton leaves which we make. We chose leaves to reflect how fragile le is, while some people will bring a bauble to hang on the tree which has a picture of their loves ones on it, she continued.ldquoWe will also have a bigger tree this year more as more people have been attending as suicide figures continue to rise. It is always a very emotional service and there are very few people who donrsquot know some family that has been touched by it.Ailish explained that all the names placed on the tree this year will be kept and placed alongside those gathered over the past two years with the intention of placing them in a time capsule at some point in the future which will be buried locally.She continued: ldquoChristmas is a dficult time for families and that is why we do not decorate our tree located at the front of our building which looks out on to Market Street. There is no tinsel or lights.ldquoThis time of year can be troubling for many families and we choose not to decorate our tree which is much like the empty chair in many peoplersquos homes as their loved ones are no longer here.Ailish said the tree is decorated by those who have lost their lives, not through suicide, but due to mental health problems and addictions, highlighting the importance of people recognising this.She added: ldquoIt is depression that kills, not the selfish act of an irrational mind. People think suicide is a selfish act, but it is not.ldquoWe are extending an open invitation to next Thursday eveningrsquos service and people who have lost loved ones, regardless of the reason, are welcome to join us.ldquoWe would like them to join us and place a small decoration on the Christmas tree in memory of a loved one.

For the past few years we have been unable to tell Tourism NI or Bord Faacuteilte when our festivals were likely to take place as the local authority does not even have a calendar of events looking forward.ldquoMost festivals run at the same time each year in the Down area and it would not be a dficult task to publish a calendar that would cover a five year period to include both council tourism and community-led events.Cllr Enright believes the introduction of such a calendar would have several benefits, ensuring there would be no overlapping of festivals in the same area, allowing Tourism NI to be aware of them well in advance and local festivals and events appearing in their brochures and in tourism offices at home and abroad.Gerry Casey, from the Ardglass Festival Association, described the current funding mechanism in place for community festivals as ldquoinadequate.He continued: ldquoVillages cannot plan ahead with such short-term annualised funding. The process in the new council makes funding for these festivals precarious and uncertain from year to year and inhibits festival organisers booking in advance to get best prices or being able to secure match funding from where.ldquoThe Ardglass festival has been running for  consecutive years and been funded for  of those.

Brandon Lewis said that there were a number of hurdles before the backstop could come in, andit did it would not be permanent.Mr Lewis, who is minister without portfolio, and also chairman of the Conservative Party, was speaking to the News Letter on a visit to Dale Farm, in north Belfast.We asked him about the criticism of the Withdrawal Agreement that it had, in effect, created a situation in which Northern Ireland would never be able to leave the European Union customs or regulatory zones “There is a lot of focus on the backstop but the reality is that before the backstop we’ve got an implementation period in which to secure that future trade agreement,” he said, “so it has already been clearly fleshed out in that political declaration,” “I know people say, why can’t we get the deal finalised at the same time as the Withdrawal Agreement, but the way that the structure of EU law works you can’t do that in the EU, you have to negotiate it as a third party, so that has to come after March  .”Mr Lewis added: “The outline of the political declaration shows that we have got that in principle agreement about what we want that future agreement to be, and we’ve got that period of  months roughly to negotiate that by the end of . “If by the end of  we are not actually quite there, that could be for a range of reasons, ... the logical thing that the parties are more likely to look at is extending the implementation period, which is one of the options within the agreement for one to two years at most.“You’ve also got the option eventhat doesn’t work that you can have alternative arrangements which, with a few years between, there’s lots of things that can develop, particularly technology wise that solve that, before you even get to the backstop.”Mr Lewis said that people sometimes forget that the backstop “is hugely against what the EU would ever want to come in, because from their point of view gives us tarf free access to the customs union market with no payments, no fishing rights, no free movement, which is for them I think quite dficult in terms of the four principles”.He added “I simply don’t believe it is likely we will end up in that position. Evenwe do end up in a backstop the reality is that it has to be temporary, that is how Article  is structured.”Asked , given that this sequencing gave the EU a powerful negotiating position, it might be better to leave without a deal and then negotiate as a third party without any prior pledges, he replied: “No, absolutely not, for two reasons.“I don’t believe that the potential of the backstop is something the EU would want and is in their interest because as I say, from the EU’s point of view ... I don’t accept that there is any reason for the EU to want the backstop at all, let alone to want it for any period of time.”Sylvia Hermon: businesses and farmers are right to back PM’s Brexit deal Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Lewis added: “To the other side of your question, which is the idea of no deal, no I don’t, having just spent an hour or so, just before I came in here with businesses, that the Institute of Directors have arranged, anybody who talks to businesses actually across the UK but particularly here in Northern Ireland, it doesn’t take very long to realise why no deal is not a good option for the UK and why business doesn’t want no deal because just in time products for agri foods, it is hugely potentially hugely damaging for the job opportunities, and actually job numbers across the country.”Mr Lewis was askedhis Conservative Party was disintegrating in front of his eyes with bitter isions over Brexit.He replied: “No our membership is increasing, we are increasing our professional campaigning machine, we had a very good set of local elections this year, we had a good conference.“I am planning for , councillors getting elected next May of which two thirds roughly we are defending, and the party machine is in good health in that way and I want to continue to see that improve and grow.”• News Letter grills Theresa May on backstop• Ben Lowry on Brexit and the coming week• Jim Nicholson: MPs can still get a better deal• David Lidington: Tory pact with DUP still going JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8732434.1544190778!/image/image.jpg","title":"education","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Education   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Education Politics Crime Farming Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat News Politics Crime Farming Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Education       Northern Irelands first fully interactive safety educational centre.General view of the facility.

It was obvious. It wasn’t a shock or a surprise.“I made clear that it had to be time-limited and finite, and Michel Barnier, at one point in one of our meetings, said ‘I understand it needs to be short’, but I’m afraid after that the technical track for the negotiations took it in another direction and I was very clear with the Prime Minister that we should of stood firm at that point, and that was back in July.“Now I’m not suggesting it’s easy to go back. You lose moments in negotiations and you can’t just claw them back. What I am suggesting is that there is probably more flexibility than is being suggested and actually we should have taken a robust line back then and we certainly should be taking one now.”Commenting on Northern Ireland he said: “I’m very surprised in the way that Northern Ireland was treated, and you would hear swirling around in Brussels, particularly the people aroundSelmayrand some others, that losing Northern Ireland would be the price that the UK would pay for Brexit. This was reported to me through the diplomatic channels.“There’s one thing to defend your interests robustly, there’s another thing in the spirit of so-called European unity to be trying to carve up a major European nation.”On no-deal technical notices issued by the Government, Mr Raab said: “Well I scrutinised all of those papers and frankly I can say, now as a backbencher, that some of those assumptions are just not credible.”Asked about Mrs May’s future, Mr Raab added: “I think she could still, even in the event of a big loss on the vote, which we expect, I think she could still turn it round. But we need a change of approach. She needs to go back with a,you like, a best final offer to the EU.”He commented: “The reality is, I stood up and tried to make it work. But I couldn’t in good conscience go to Brussels and sign a deal with Michel Barnier that I feel would be so damaging to the British economy and devastating to our democracy.”UUP demands that Prime Minister goes back to negotiating table on Brexit Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Raab later said he would not rule himself out of running for leader but stressed he would not “get sucked into that debate”.try catch  TrendingSnow forecast for N.I. this week - tonights temperature to drop to -degCPSNI issue warning to O customers seeking refund after network outageWhat we know so far about the man shot dead outside N.I. schoolFatal shooting: Man gunned down outside schoolO compensation package revealed          ..

Theresa Mays deal delivers on the Brexit referendum result, says Karen BradleyThis government has an overriding duty, not just to deliver on the referendum result, but also to do so in ways that keep our United Kingdom united.The deal achieved by the prime minister is the only one on the table that can do that. Northern Ireland’s constitutional status within the United Kingdom is fully protected, whilst its unique history and geography are respected.It is an unprecedented and ambitious relationship which will protect jobs, communities and livelihoods across Northern Ireland, and the UK as a whole.I am proud to serve in a government that will never be neutral in its support of our precious Union and for Northern Ireland’s integral place within it, based on the consent principle as set out in the Belfast Agreement. We believe firmly that the best future for Northern Ireland lies within a stronger United Kingdom.Our ambition is to build a modern, dynamic, outward-looking Northern Ireland that works for everyone, regardless of their background. It is a Northern Ireland in which politics works, the economy grows and society is stronger. I believe this approach is in the best traditions of positive and constructive unionism.The deal we have reached with the EU helps us to achieve this. It avoids a hard border with Ireland and prevents a customs border in the Irish Sea, therefore allowing the people of Northern Ireland to continue living their lives as they do now. Crucially it will ensure that Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom, will continue to benefit from the stability, security and prosperity that comes with being part of the world’s fth largest economy.I know from speaking to businesses, homeowners and consumers across Northern Ireland, that people just want us to get on with the job. Northern Ireland’s business community, in particular, has been very supportive of the deal. Over % of Manufacturing NI members back this deal, as do other business and farming representative bodies like the Federation of Small Business, the Institute of Directors and the Ulster Farmers’ Union.Leaving without an agreement in place, or an implementation period through which to adjust to our new relationship, would cause acute uncertainty for businesses, citizens, and consumers alike. This would pose unique challenges for Northern Ireland in particular.Strengthening Northern Ireland’s economy was an important idend of the political settlement of the Belfast Agreement – all of us have a duty to safeguard those gains in how we deliver on the Brexit vote.The prime minister believes passionately, as do I, that our country is stronger and better together. She has fought hard to preserve the bonds between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Like her, I am convinced that our best days lie ahead of us.As we face the challenges and reap the opportunities of Brexit, it is essential that we do so as one nation in a way that preserves prosperity in all parts of the UK. This deal achieves exactly that. It is not perfect, but that is the nature of a long and complex negotiation process. It is, however, the only solution on the table that delivers on the referendum, acknowledges Northern Ireland’s unique position, and delivers a stronger, fairer and more prosperous United Kingdom.UUP demands that Prime Minister goes back to negotiating table on Brexit Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingSnow forecast for N.I. this week - tonights temperature to drop to -degCPSNI issue warning to O customers seeking refund after network outageWhat we know so far about the man shot dead outside N.I. schoolFatal shooting: Man gunned down outside schoolO compensation package revealed          ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos no use putting more on the roads without removing some of the current commuting traffic, he said.ldquoDespite all the talk of rail and tram improvements there isnrsquot any scope to increase the minimal park-and-ride facilities at Eastbrook and none at all at Dinas Powys.After the Public Consultation, the WelTAG Draft Stage  Report will go to the Vale Cabinet.Members will probably ask their Scrutiny Committee for Environment and Regeneration to give their opinion.The Steering Group is also seeking to engage Ken Skates AM, Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Transport in talks that could involve private sector developments to help fund a by-pass.But theyrsquove been put on hold awaiting the Stage  report. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar.

Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come.

And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/223.jpg","title":"lunns opening m rolex store in city","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by Ulster Business Luxury watch and jewellery business Lunn’s is opening a new £m Rolex store in Belfast city centre.

Earlier this year, it was announced that Queen’s Arcade would undergo a major £m facelt. Peter Lunn, chairman of Lunn’s Jewellers, said the decision by Rolex to open in Belfast is “a huge endorsement for the city”. “Rolex is one of the world’s true super-brands and to have their store on Donegall Place, the city’s main retail thoroughfare, is a major expression of confidence. The store will offer customers a truly immersive experience of the brand. “We are also very excited to be opening a fully accredited Rolex workshop, which will help owners to maintain the value and ensure the quality of their watches by having them serviced by skilled technicians on site at Queen’s Arcade.

Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

A deal is on the table, though.Nick says that, aside from issues around getting staff, a transition must be in place after March  for export certicates, otherwise he can’t sell product outside the UK.“I have an ambition to get it to the mid-s . We are growing our EBITA from the £m average to about £m.”Pre-tax profits have cracked the £m mark in the last year, while turnover has soared by almost £m to £m.Nick says he turned his attention to attracting back some of the farmers which it has lost to other competitors.“At one point we had a billion litres of milk, now it’s around  million. We hadn’t been paying a particularly good milk price. “What ithad done is invested in itself quite heavily, and invested in the future, and had made a really brave strategic decision in , long before I came here, to get out of producing milk powders, and getting in to cheese and whey.“Now, that cost them £m to do that. That was really brave.“The first thing we did was get out to farmers, and explain to them what their business was.“We have paid a leading milk price, and that has brought genuine pride.“We needed to get into the business. The most fundamental change – it’s a people agenda. We were a very centralised business and all decisions came from the top, and went out.“Now, we have put the business into seven strategic business units and we are getting more adept with strategy, day-to-day, and developing people within the business to take ownership.”Nick says it’s about getting the right people into the business, and helping mentor and develop strong teams to ensure Dale Farm’s success.“We have spent a lot of money on additional people in the business. It’s not about numbers, it’s not about capacity, it’s about capability. We are really trying to find world-class people. gtHe said the firm will spend another £m on its people this year. Meanwhile, data and decision making is another area it’s expanding and developing. gt“We have a little bit of latency in the business, and I’m saying how do I get live information to those people ”That includes looking at new markets and products. Nick says the business had been focusing on the macro, and perhaps missed potential opportunities.“We have massive opportunities for growth,” he said. “The EBITA growth isn’t necessarily about growing your top-line, although it will grow a bit. We process  million litres of milk. Are you making sure you are making products which will give you the most profit from that – the answer to that is no.“We can switch categories and products, and we can make a whole lot more money with the  million litres. “It’s looking at consumer trends by getting out of commoditised type products and getting in to more value-added products. That’s about understanding your consumer.”He said the business has made “serious traction” in the last two years, as a company. As for growth in the future, with March  around the corner, Nick says it will continue “as long as there isn’t something mad and disruptive from Brexit”.“That could happen. A ‘no deal’ and no transition Brexit is mad and disruptive and changes everything. I don’t think people have really looked at it, and really understand what it means. We have looked at it, and it’s very challenging.”For Dale Farm, Nick’s Brexit concerns centre around staff and people – with around % of the workforce EU nationals.Nick says the company has struggled to get lorry drivers when milk supply is at its peak.But for Dale Farm, and other food processors, there is a concern over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says.“For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t.“It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate.“I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now.”“Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.”Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy output goes to the EU and the rest of the world. “In milk, milk keeps flowing. We can’t say to farmers ‘we can’t sell the product, can’t get the certicates, tell the cows to take a break for a few weeks’. It doesn’t happen.“I’m going to have to reassess... ‘how long can I survive not selling my % of dairy off the island ’“If there is a no-transition no-deal Brexit it will be really bad for business. Supply chains will be severely disputed and you’ll have a shortage of products everywhere.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sk_123.jpg","title":"more than  of business group members back brexit withdrawal deal","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s business community has overwhelming thrown its weight behind a withdrawal agreement on Brexit – with almost % of one major lobby group’s members in favour, it can be revealed.The CBI, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses and IoD are among the groups which have backed the deal on the table.

The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before.
