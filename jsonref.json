The restructuring firm FRP Advisory is working alongside its management under a “light touch” administration.This means directors are running the business rather than handing it over to the administrators. The chain has already shut 18 stores, with the loss of more than 1,000 jobs in shops and at the headquarters in London. After lease negotiations with landlords, 124 stores are still trading. They reopened on 15 June after the government allowed non-essential retailers to open again following the Covid-19 lockdown.“Now that Debenhams has 124 stores in the UK open and is trading ahead of expectations, the administrators of Debenhams Retail Ltd have initiated a process to assess ways for the business to exit its protective administration,” the company said on Sunday.“There are a range of possible outcomes which could include the current owners retaining the business, potential new joint venture arrangements (with existing and potential new investors) or a sale to a third party, and the administrators will be guided by what delivers the best outcome for creditors.”Like other retailers, Debenhams has been badly hit by the coronavirus lockdown, but was already struggling with a £600m debt pile. It previously went into administration in April 2019, which wiped out its shareholders and transferred ownership to a group of financial investors including US hedge funds managed by Silver Point Capital and GoldenTree Asset Management. Debenhams then underwent a company voluntary arrangement, an insolvency procedure that allowed it to close stores and renegotiate rents.Debenhams’ Irish chain has been placed into liquidation, but a liquidation of the main group is unlikely and would only happen once all other options have been exhausted. Debenhams also owns the Magasin du Nord chain in Denmark.Rival John Lewis plans to close eight of its 50 stores putting 1,300 jobs at risk, while Marks \u0026amp Spencer is cutting 950 jobs as part of a £500m cost-saving drive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed3a7f0a79281d44e37f23f6d7e60b090470ee3b/0_9_5373_3224/master/5373.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e835ded5c38652ba811e147b96e2617","title":"natwest customers say accounts closed applied for coronavirus bounce back loans","story":"Small business say funds were blocked after applying for government-backed schemeNatWest has shut the accounts of some small business customers who applied for government-backed loans to help them get through the pandemic, leaving them distressed and unable to access their cash.The bank said the reasons for closing the accounts were valid, but the closures came after customers had been approved for loans and were expecting to receive the money in their accounts.Instead, customers said their money had been blocked without notice, with one saying he was now unable to afford food as a result.The Treasury is about to enter talks with the UK’s largest banks on a plan to help tackle the tens of billions of pounds of bad debts expected to result from the bounce-back loan scheme (BBLS), which requires only minimal checks on the borrower’s ability to pay the money back.The NatWest group has been responsible for more than a fifth of the lending across the three government-backed loan schemes. However, there have been claims that the bank initially struggled under the weight of loan applications, and that the fraud checks that needed to be carried out were causing issues.NatWest is bracing itself for a wave of bad debts, but on Sunday denied reports that it plans to make cost savings of £3bn over the next five years.The bank, which changed its name from RBS last week, said a report in the Sunday Times that it was planning to reduce its annual costs from £7bn to £4bn was inaccurate. “We do not have any plans of this type,” a spokeswoman said.It is not clear how many accounts have been closed following bounce-back loan applications, or why NatWest has frozen the accounts of existing customers after approving them for a loan.Twitter users have claimed in recent days that NatWest has shut their accounts after approving bounce-back loans. Meanwhile, a Facebook group called “NatWest closed down my account” that was set up in January now has more than 1,300 members, with many posting similar claims.On the three cases the  passed to the bank, the NatWest spokesperson added: “Investigations confirm that the reason for closing these specific customers’ accounts is valid.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd08e2883879df798edfa89b856a3dc07bc5b109/0_120_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=6bc22c4770e3982bc47329c61b4bff91","title":"schoolgirls in england have you been informally excluded","story":"We’d like to hear from girls – or their parents – who have been excluded from a school in England via informal methods Girls are being informally excluded at a higher rate than boys from some schools in England, according to a study by not-for-profit group Social Finance.While boys are much more likely to be formally excluded, research shows girls are being excluded through moves to other schools or by leaving one school before the end of year 11 and not finishing their studies elsewhere.

Some of us will miss the age of the automobileThe past few months showed us something that many thought we’d never see in our lifetimes: empty roads. Miles of asphalt without a single vehicle to spoil the view. Parked cars gathered dust, multi-storeys were deserted and garages shuttered. As lockdown eased, cars started to fill our streets again. But the great hiatus provided a glimpse into an alternative future.Some cities, such as Milan, have already stated that they want to make permanent the changes brought about by the pandemic, and there have been calls across Britain for more space for walking and cycling. The warning lights signalling the end of the car’s total dominance over the way we travel and the way we plan cities are now flashing.For the past 15 years, I have been the Observer’s motoring editor. Like so many other things, the pandemic brought my weekly column to a juddering halt. Though environmental concerns also played a factor in its demise, it’s hard to review cars if you can’t drive anywhere, despite the temptation of those blissfully empty roads. What does looking back over 15 years of reviewing cars tell me about motoring’s next chapter? The automobile has dramatically transformed our lives since its invention. Steam-powered and even hydrogen-driven automobiles can be dated to the 1770s, but 1886 is generally regarded as the “birth year” of the modern motor. That was when Karl Benz patented his first Motorwagen. There are now 1.3bn cars on the world’s roads. In terms of captivating design coupled with brilliant technology, the last half-century has surely been the car’s golden age. If you regard motor manufacturing as an artform, these past decades will be seen as the automobile’s high mark, its Renaissance era, as one game-changing advance was piled on another. But a glance in your rearview mirror will tell you that this period will also be known as the last time cars could be driven with a clear conscience, a time of motoring innocence before driving became so compromised freighted with the knowledge that these beautiful machines were wrecking our planet.Guilt has never made for an amenable passenger, and the pumping soundtrack of a gurgling V8 soon starts to sound like a death rattle.I’ve loved cars for as long as I can remember. My mother has a picture of me as a toddler sitting on my potty, knock-kneed and in red sandals, earnestly parking my fleet of colourful Dinky toy cars. I then grew up and through my job found myself at the wheel of the real-life versions of the same models I’d been playing with. As a journalist, I drove everything from the first Series 1 1948 Land Rover Defender, with its famous registration plate HUE 166, to the last Jaguar E-Type to roll off the production line in Coventry in 1974. I drove around Le Mans in a vintage 1954 racing car with the grandson of William Lyons, the founder of Jaguar. I drove a one-off futuristic VW prototype with consumption figures so low you could go from London to Edinburgh on little more than a sip of fuel.There were Minis and Mondeos, Fiats and Ferraris, MPVs, SUVs, ATVs… I remember thinking it was funny to take an Aston Martin to a McDonald’s drive-thru, only to see there was a Lamborghini in the queue behind me. I took our household rubbish to the council tip in a Rolls-Royce – and was cheered by the workers there.I’ve long been dazzled by the car’s mechanical mastery of the multiple threats of travelling at speed with a tank of highly flammable liquid in the back. I’m amazed you can drive in comfort over frozen tundra or across a scorching desert with your paint job remaining immaculate through a swing of 60C. Why doesn’t it all just flake off? Cars give us limitless freedom. They’re our escape pods, parked on permanent standby. So what’s going to happen to them now? The next generation of motorists will see transformative technology once again reinvent vehicles. But how quickly will it happen? Will we soon be driven by fleets of self-piloted zombie cars? When autonomous cars finally become the norm, a point which is nowhere near as tantalisingly close as some suggest, one of the biggest changes will be the reduction in the number of fatal accidents. It will become almost impossible to die in a crash. It won’t just be lives that are saved, either. Autonomy will create efficiencies in many ways. These vehicles won’t be owned – we will rent them by the hour or day, which means we won’t need so many. and our streets won’t be so clogged with underused cars. Traffic lights, road signs and markings will become unnecessary – the cars know where they are going. Our cities will be quieter and cleaner. Our built environment will be less dominated by the infrastructure of the road.The elderly, infirm and even visually impaired will be able to enjoy driving without depending on taxis or other people. Autonomous cars will be far more energy efficient, too. Some studies estimate that fuel use will fall by at least a quarter.It all sounds pretty good, but this auto-utopia is still a long way from reality. There are so many obstacles to overcome. First up there is cost. Superfast sensors, lasers and cameras don’t come cheap. Then there is safety. On average, a vehicle in the UK is involved in a fatal crash once in every 200 million miles. This gives you a clue as to the phenomenal scale of testing that autonomous systems will have to undergo before we as humans will be prepared to hand over the steering wheel to a computer.What about insurance? If there is a crash, who and what is responsible? The mapping providers? The GPS system? The robo-pilot? Will our premiums drop? What about our no-claims bonus?In theory, any car can be modified to be self-driving. But for some reason, we tend to pair autonomy with electric vehicles. Battery technology, despite being around for more than a century, is still in its infancy. As the uptake of electric cars increases so their power packs will become smarter, more productive and more efficient. The lack of fast chargers and anxiety over range will cease to be an issue. Clearly, we are in dire need of more public charging points, and the uptake of electric vehicles won’t truly get into its stride without the installation of thousands of easy-to-access charge sites across the UK. But a lack of petrol stations didn’t stop Henry Ford rolling out his world-beating Model T. He once famously said: “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”A ban on all new sales of petrol and diesel cars by 2035 will focus our minds. But how ethical and sustainable is the production of an EV? The manufacture of the cars – and particularly the essential minerals for the batteries, often mined in countries with poor environmental records and even worse abuses of their labour force – is anything but green. Swapping an internal combustion engine for an electric motor is only a short-term fix. Are we, in fact, just kicking our problems down the street?Of all the scenarios about what we’ll be driving in the coming years, the one I find most plausible is that many of us will actually choose not to drive at all. In some ways, it’ll be a relief. Commuter constipation, motorway standstills and city gridlock all mean that driving now is often just a frustrating nightmare.Before the lockdown, Birmingham – once, proudly, the UK’s “motorway city” – had already announced plans to entice people out of their cars and on to bikes and buses, and on to their feet. If Birmingham goes ahead, it will join areas of York, Bath, Sheffield, Leeds, Edinburgh and Brighton among others, which have already experimented with car-free days. Bristol has announced plans to ban diesel soon.Further afield, Madrid has banned older cars from its centre, and Paris is following a similar route. The sustainable transport charity Sustrans estimates that of the 6.8 million private vehicle trips that were made daily in Greater London, 4.2 million could be walked or cycled.It’s ironic that the answer to all our car problems might be as simple as more of us turning off our engines, getting out – and simply using our own legs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e184512f2ed6068be7a21611048799d951b2a54/0_291_4961_2977/master/4961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de47001ae7c65bde1142378501e10925","title":"20 must see documentaries to explain the world in 2020","story":"From climate change and Black Lives Matter to Tiger King and Taylor Swift, these are the factual films that best capture and explain what’s going on around us It’s a must-watch because… An ongoing scandal of unchecked power and abuse is explored with emotional urgency.This four-hour inquiry from Netflix, currently lapping its competitors in the non-fiction miniseries department, is surely not the last documentary we’ll see on the late American financier and his horrific history of underage sexual abuse. After all, it’s a story that is still unfolding, with his ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell recently taken into custody. But there’s power in being the first, and Lisa Bryant’s project – which entered production, securely under wraps, while Epstein was still alive – valuably amplifies the voices of victims who were unheard for too long.After 25 years as a showrunner and producer, Lisa Bryant’s first documentary series as a director was\u0026nbspJeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,\u0026nbspwhich premiered on Netflix in May. Originally based on James Patterson’s 2016 book of the same name, the four-parter developed the story of Epstein’s life, his court cases, and his death.Why did you decide to make\u0026nbspFilthy Rich?To show how our justice system was broken, expose Epstein’s abuse of wealth and power, and most importantly, to give the survivors a platform to get their voices heard.When did you start working on\u0026nbspit?Long before Epstein was arrested and dead, when he was still powerful, wealthy and intimidating, in November 2018.What problems did you have getting it made?We had to get a private room locked in our production offices for interviews, and encrypted communications to make sure no one hacked in. We had to protect everything we had, then the story started changing overnight.And it’s still changing. How did you react to Ghislaine Maxwell’s arrest?I hope our documentary played some part in putting pressure on the FBI to act quickly. Ghislaine will be the first of many arrests.Do you think\u0026nbspPrince Andrew\u0026nbspwill speak?It’s interesting that the US is saying “We’re asking him for answers”, and he’s saying “I’m offering them up, but no one wants them”. I hope for the women’s sakes he does offer answers. I don’t know if he’ll ever fully come clean, but I think the survivors would still respect him if he spoke to the FBI.What can’t you live without while you’re working?Good co-workers, and two cups of coffee before 10am, or else I get a headache!How would you sell documentary films to someone who says they’re not into factual films?I’d tell them documentaries use lots of techniques from other films, so are more intriguing and entertaining than one would think.What has stayed with you since you finished\u0026nbspFilthy Rich?Survivors saying how being involved has changed their lives for the better. It’s especially gratifying when it’s people that hadn’t spoken before. One woman started a Facebook group for Epstein survivors.What do you think about the current state of the documentary industry?It’s a very good storytelling time. Documentaries now start worldwide conversations.A must-watch because…The Black Lives Matter movement has put James Baldwin on everyone’s reading list: this doc perfectly complements his writing.It’s a couple of years since Haiti-born filmmaker Peck won a Bafta, and earned an Oscar nomination, for this fervid, fiery tribute to James Baldwin – but with the black American author’s work surging in popularity amid the BLM protests, it feels due another celebration. This isn’t a drably standard biographical documentary: instead, it engages imaginatively with Baldwin’s political ideas and convictions, emerging as a rousing work of activism in its own right.A must-watch because… A sports documentary that builds into a rousing celebration of a black icon.Even people who aren’t especially into basketball – which, in Britain, is admittedly rather a lot of the population – got hooked on this “10-part documentary event” surveying the extraordinary sporting legacy of Michael Jordan. And yes, “event” is Netflix’s own wording: there’s little room for modesty in a series that nominally covers the ups and downs of Jordan’s career, but concentrates most exhilaratingly on the ups: it’s hard not to get caught up in the stakes of his final season with the Chicago Bulls.A must-watch because… Its depiction of social tensions and restrictions under quarantine feel weirdly of the moment.One for the “stranger than fiction” file: viewers who followed the news in the early 1990s might recall the hype around Biosphere 2, an elaborate environmental project constructed in Arizona, intended to be a fully self-sufficient ecosystem, all contained under glass. (Biosphere 1, if you’re wondering, is Earth itself.) Eight people volunteered to spend two years in its confines: Matt Wolf’s slick, absorbing documentary charts the fallout of a project that was equal parts worthy eco-hippie research, peculiar cult and Big Brother prototype.Directors: Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering Multiple platformsA must-watch because…No documentary has so powerfully connected the causes of #MeToo and Black Lives Matter.The #MeToo movement has yielded a number of documentaries, but a strikingly intersectional perspective makes this searing account of sexual abuse in the hip-hop industry – as articulated by the women who tell of being sexually abused by Def Jam Records chief Russell Simmons – a landmark. (Simmons has denied all accusations.) Dick and Ziering’s film is candid about the particular difficulties black women have faced in coming forward with their stories. Former executive producer Oprah Winfrey controversially withdrew her backing from the film days before its Sundance premiere, but that hasn’t dimmed its critical and audience acclaim.A must-watch because…As far-right, anti-LGBTQ politics spread across Europe, here’s a terrifying glimpse of them in action.His films How to Survive a Plague and The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson established David France as the foremost docmaker in the field of LGBTQ history. His latest, however, is a gripping present-tense affair, documenting the state-sanctioned purge of gay people in the Chechen Republic. Using groundbreaking face-morphing technology to protect the identities of participating victims, France’s film tracks the efforts of a Russian activist group to extract vulnerable people from the country and shepherd them to safety: it’s an escape thriller with perilously high human stakes.David France is an American investigative reporter, nonfiction author and director of the Oscar-nominated documentary\u0026nbspHow to Survive a Plague. His new film is Welcome to Chechnya.What\u0026nbspcan documentary film-making\u0026nbspdo that journalism can’t?It can reflect not just fact but emotion, in a way that is really unmatched by any other kind of nonfiction storytelling.Do you consider yourself first a journalist, film-maker or activist?Journalist first. I don’t consider myself an activist. For years I have wanted to understand what motivates people to be activists. There’s something that makes them run toward a problem, where the rest of us might run away from it. It is their work that audiences react to. I am merely the person who carries their stories out to a larger universe.What do you think is the greatest documentary ever made?Honeyland. It’s a story about the natural world, the tragedy and chaos of modernity, and the survival of the heart.\u0026nbsp I’ve seen it a dozen times maybe.A must-watch because…“The UK is not innocent” has been a popular rallying cry of recent Black Lives Matter protests: this doc tells us why.As Britain continues to grapple with the national shame of the Windrush scandal – which recently saw thousands of legally settled, Caribbean-born UK residents threatened with deportation – this BBC documentary, written and presented by David Olusoga, delves into the roots of the institutional racism that caused it, exposing the “hostile environment” associated with Theresa May as a political objective preceding her by several generations. It’s suitably enraging stuff, but its emotional pull is enriched by a wealth of thorough, knotty historical detail.Produced by Keith Scholey and Alastair FothergillA must-watch because…Some climate-change docs can be on the dour side, but this offers a bright, accessible conversation starter on the subject.For many of us, it feels as if David Attenborough has narrated our entire life in some capacity. That voice is a reassuring brand in itself, making us listen more attentively to the specifics of his nature documentaries than we might do otherwise, particularly with such reliably ravishing visuals to contend with. That’s of particular value in his high-gloss Netflix series made last year, given its particular focus on climate change as propagated by humans and experienced by all organisms.A must-watch because…A ferocious study of racial oppression in American prisons made waves in 2016, and is still vital in Trump’s America.Another Bafta winner that just missed Oscar gold, Ava DuVernay’s first documentary feature after a trio of career-boosting narrative films is ostensibly about racial injustice in the prison system, but emerges as an expansive, furious view of the collective psychology that keeps archaic racial hierarchies in place across America. The title refers to the 13th amendment, which tweaked the abolition of slavery to permit involuntary servitude for convicted criminals: for many in America, DuVernay suggests, prison is slavery. Her argument is radical and persuasive.A must-watch because…Transgender rights are a sticking point even for many self-described liberals: this tender, straight-talking doc has the power to change perceptions.“The Dad Who Gave Birth” is the subtitle often tacked onto Jeanie Finlay’s study of transgender pregnancy, striking a blunt, tabloid-y note that doesn’t square with the film’s own delicate, humane approach. But yes, that’s the story in a nutshell, as the film documents trans man and  journalist Freddy McConnell’s struggle to conceive and deliver his own child. Finlay covers the social, emotional and medical complications of this process in candid but unsensationalised detail.Directors: Rebecca Chaikin and Eric Goode NetflixA must-watch because…A wild ride any way you slice it, this is documentary-making for the post-truth era, inviting us to decide how we consume and believe its information.Yes, this compulsive Netflix miniseries – a viral obsession in the early days of lockdown – is unabashed trash, to the extent that it’s being adapted into a narrative film starring Nicolas Cage. Viewers got hooked on the lurid tale of eccentric gay zookeeper and convicted felon Joe Exotic and his escalating feud with conservationist Carole Baskin critics expressed increasing scepticism over the film’s pile-up of tall stories and allegations, presented in equal, credulous fashion for the internet to pore over.A must-watch because…A rare female perspective on the Syrian civil war, the worst humanitarian crisis of our age.The Syrian conflict has inspired a steady stream of documentaries on its fighters and casualties – most of them can hardly fail to be moving, but it takes a unique point of view to cut through the numbing noise. The most-nominated documentary in Bafta history, this has that: taking the form of a video diary by co-director Al-Kateab as she weathers the conflict in Aleppo over six years, first as a student and eventually as a young mother, it’s an extraordinary ground-level chronicle.Directors: Tamara Kotevska and Ljubomir Stefanov Multiple platformsA must-watch because…A poetic allegory for the war between traditional and modern agriculture that doesn’t hit you over the head.Rightly showered with awards on the festival circuit last year, finally culminating in an Oscar nomination, this is environmental docmaking of a subtle, artful order, marrying ecological concerns with rich, close-up human character study. It follows Hatidze Muratova, an ageing, independent beekeeper living in the remote Macedonian mountains, as she finds her ecosystem threatened by a neighbouring Turkish family with brasher honey-gathering ambitions: warm, funny and exquisitely photographed, it invites us to consider what we give the land we take from.A must-watch because…Taylor Swift is among the most ubiquitous celebrities of this era: here’s an insight into what that means, for her and for us.If you’re not a devotee of all-American pop goddess Taylor Swift, you might wonder what’s to be gained from a documentary covering her life and labours over the course of recording her last two albums. But Lana Wilson’s Sundance-premiered documentary isn’t mere fan service: it’s a fascinating glimpse into the construction and deconstruction of celebrity in the Instagram era, covering Swift’s transition from carefully managed blank slate to politically outspoken liberal. Oh, and the music is pretty good too.A must-watch because…Unusual as a story of male victimhood in the #MeToo reckoning, it prompts uncomfortable questions about trauma, and who gets to control it.As storytelling, this harrowing British documentary is best viewed with as little advance knowledge as possible. Yet a trigger warning is in order for what emerges, through its tricky structure, as a tale of horrifying childhood abuse, shrouded in conflicting layers of memory and misinformation. At the centre of it are now middle-aged twin brothers Alex and Marcus Lewis, the former afflicted with amnesia following a teenage motorbike accident, the latter having taken charge of his brother’s memories in surprising ways.A must-watch because…You won’t see a more pointed inquiry into religious freedom at the moment – or a funnier one.The question mark in Penny Lane’s puckish, perceptive, sometimes riotous documentary about the Satanic Temple and its followers in the US may seem like a trollish affectation, but there’s a reason for it: by the time it’s finished, what these self-styled satanists stand for isn’t as clear-cut as you might think. Lane seeks the lighter, more humane side of a dark movement, but also a politically canny one: devil worship here emerges principally as a weapon in a culture war against the Christian right.Directors: Karim Amer and Jehane Noujaim NetflixA must-watch because…While we’re still living with the consequences of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, this is the clearest primer on how it all went down.We’re still awaiting a definitive documentary on the whole national catastrophe of the Brexit referendum, but this engrossing Netflix effort offers essential insight into the adjacent matter of the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Centred on whistleblower Brittany Kaiser, academic David Carroll and Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr, the film overlaps their observations and experiences to unpack the far-reaching influence of the data research company, from Brexit to the last US presidential election and beyond.A must-watch because…It gives human dimension to the cold statistics around the refugee crisis.We’ve seen a lot of documentaries in recent years about the European refugee crisis, but few as personally invested as Afghan film-maker Hassan Fazili’s riveting first-hand account of his own family’s gruelling escape from Afghanistan. As they trek overland from one European country to the next in search of asylum, facing violence and exploitation along the way, Fazili shoots their epic journey on a series of smartphone cameras: in addition to its emotional power, the film demonstrates the medium’s rapidly expanding technical possibilities.A must-watch because… A hard-hitting cautionary tale of the far-right takeover in Brazil – with international resonance.A global wave of sympathy didn’t exactly greet the recent news that far-right Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro had tested positive for coronavirus Petra Costa’s chilling, beautifully constructed account of his rise to power won’t warm your heart any. In one respect, it’s a dense, impassioned explanation of a political swing that’s been difficult to follow merely from headlines, but there’s universal resonance here too: the fractious public mood evoked here will be recognisable to residents of Trump’s America or Boris Johnson’s Britain.Petra Costa is a Brazilian director whose films blur personal narratives and documentary. Her Oscar-nominated\u0026nbspThe Edge\u0026nbspof Democracy\u0026nbsptraces the\u0026nbspcollapse\u0026nbspof the political system in her home country, and reflects on her family on either side of the political ide. Costa is currently working on\u0026nbspDystopia, about the Covid-19 outbreak in Brazil.Was the film a story for\u0026nbspBrazil, or for an international audience?Reading British people’s accounts of their psychological state after Brexit – a few months after the protest I filmed – was when I finally understood what I was feeling. People of my generation feel groundless. The same happened after the election of Donald Trump. My film is about the relationship of an inidual to his or her democracy, and the trauma of losing that.The film ends with Jair\u0026nbspBolsonaro’s\u0026nbspinauguration\u0026nbspas president on 1 January 2019. How is it looking back at that now?He’s fulfilling his promises. In 1999, he\u0026nbspsaid\u0026nbsponce he got power he would deliver a coup, dissolve congress, and do what the military coup didn’t and kill 30,000. That is happening with Covid-19, except that 80,000 are dead. The countries hit most hard by the virus have leaders that have a lack of consideration for human life. That’s what fascism is. That’s why I’m making\u0026nbspDystopia.How are you making it?We’ve had people sending us footage from across Brazil, shot on their phones.What was the best reaction to your film?Young people saying they hadn’t spoken to their best friend for years, but after watching it, they could connect again. Plus people from Turkey, Ukraine, the UK, the US, Venezuela, who said, my God, this is our story too.A must-watch because… If you’re despairing about the state of the United States, this portrait of a new political generation is a jolt of hopeful energy.As we head into a US presidential election putting white male septuagenarians against each other, Rachel Lears’s sparky, motivating documentary is a helpful reminder that there is a younger, more erse future for American politics. Lears tracks the primary campaigns of four female progressive Democrats, but the clear star of the show is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the irresistible young New Yorker who pulled off the biggest upset victory in the 2018 midterms. Her force of personality is well-captured here: one day we’ll watch this as a reminder of where she started.Which recent documentaries most illuminate and explain the world today?

The whistle had just blown on their five years in the Premier League and nobody could say that, when the occasion demanded them to hurl the kitchen sink at Arsenal, they went down without a fight.This was a performance full of the crispness, urgency and aggression that have hallmarked their best work over the last half-decade but it came too late, as did the fightback that almost completely overhauled a three-goal deficit on the day. Had Emiliano Martínez not brilliantly saved Danny Welbeck’s backheel 16 minutes from time, shortly after his former teammate had tapped in to put Watford within two goals of safety, there is every chance they could have completed a comeback for the ages.In the end they fell short and their caretaker manager, Hayden Mullins, might reflect that he would have never been handed this most thankless of tasks if his team had shown comparable application previously. Across the season they have not been good enough, but then nor has the organisation that employs them.One poor campaign may not wreck an empire, but nor do the foundations put in place by the Pozzo family offer any kind of guarantee they will sail straight back up from the second tier. It is hard to escape the sense that Watford’s habit of flipping managers has run out of road. Their next permanent – perhaps in the loosest sense of – appointment will be the 12th in eight years and there is only so much fresh air a new broom can sweep in.Players will depart, Ismaïla Sarr showing again here that it should be inconceivable he will be playing Championship football in September, and a steady hand should be a priority.There was nothing stable about the boom-or-bust fare in an encounter Mikel Arteta described as “a bit of a basketball game”, although it certainly made for fine entertainment. Arteta said afterwards Watford’s forwards had been “cheating”, although he quickly clarified that as a football term for “gambling, staying up front”. They certainly needed to: any suggestion a battling point might eventually suffice was quickly scotched and they might wonder how things would have transpired if they had not been obliged to play catch-up.Instead they conceded a penalty almost immediately. Craig Dawson had bundled carelessly into Alexandre Lacazette within 40 seconds but it took VAR almost three minutes to be confident of awarding the spot kick, which Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang dispatched unfussily. Watford gathered themselves to press relentlessly, with Sarr in electric form on the right, and came close through Roberto Pereyra and Troy Deeney. But then Aubameyang teed up Kieran Tierney for a deflected second and, at the first drinks break, the game had been so oddly skewed that Arteta was the manager tearing a strip off his players despite Arsenal’s advantage.Aubameyang then controlled Tierney’s long throw and converted a masterful overhead kick that left him one goal short of the golden boot, an award he would have shared with Jamie Vardy if Ben Foster had not blocked one last chance near the end. Watford appeared done for but they persevered and, after David Luiz had produced another rash penalty-area challenge for the album on Welbeck, Deeney rammed in his own penalty before the break.Deeney, walking wounded for most of the season, hauled himself around the pitch and was in gladiator mode throughout. He would probably have gobbled up the chance Adam Masina missed early in the second period and further openings were spurned, too. Welbeck was thwarted for a first time by the excellent Martínez, who Arteta confirmed will start Saturday’s FA Cup final, and then had the entire Watford contingent pitchside on their feet upon converting a fizzing cross from Sarr. But Watford’s prospects faded when his next effort was repelled and the soul-searching, from top to bottom, will need to be extensive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d67b80dfb849471b6d73ea29dcdf5ac6e6b62d54/0_48_2511_1506/master/2511.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa35208b1c93c49b3924bfd524daedb1","title":"everton bournemouth premier league match report","story":"It was on the long walk out of Goodison Park towards the temporary changing room behind the Park End Stand that Bournemouth discovered their five-year residence in the Premier League was over. Eddie Howe’s side delivered as they had to, ending Everton’s 11-game unbeaten home run and recording the club’s first ever win at Goodison, but there would be no helping hand from elsewhere.Bournemouth thoroughly merited the win that ended Carlo Ancelotti’s own unbeaten home run as Everton manager but the damage had been inflicted before their arrival on Merseyside. Four points from a possible 24 since the restart had left the visitors reliant on slip-ups from Aston Villa and Watford in their bid for survival. They were not obliged. Josh King, Dominic Solanke and Junior Stanislas all scored to give Bournemouth a fourth away win of the season but, with news of Villa’s point at West Ham filtering through as they headed off the pitch, this was a triumph greeted in almost total silence.Bournemouth’s approach to the final day could not be faulted. From the first whistle they were more motivated, aggressive and dangerous than an Everton team that had lapsed into coasting mode once again and fully deserving of their precious interval lead. The accuracy of Diego Rico’s deliveries was a potent weapon and utilised at every opportunity.King had the game’s first chance when Gylfi Sigurdsson, making his 100th Premier League appearance for Everton, scuffed a clearance from a Rico cross to the feet of the visiting forward. His shot was straight at Jordan Pickford, who then produced an excellent save when King put Callum Wilson clean through on goal. The England international stood his ground well and denied Wilson with a strong one-handed stop.Everton, laboured and careless, gifted Bournemouth the breakthrough from the penalty spot. David Brooks drove a free-kick into the wall after André Gomes fouled Wilson and, in the subsequent scramble to clear inside the area, Richarlison leaned into the ball with his right arm. For reasons known only to himself. Referee Chris Kavanagh immediately pointed to the spot, VAR backed him up, and King planted his penalty hard and low past Pickford’s left hand. Bournemouth thought they should have had a second penalty for handball four minutes later when the ball clearly struck Lucas Digne’s raised arm but VAR ruled against them.Belatedly, the hosts showed some urgency in their bid to preserve a long unbeaten home run. Moise Kean, making only his sixth Premier League start, released Theo Walcott behind the Bournemouth defence with a delicate chip only for Aaron Ramsdale to block the winger’s shot with his legs. The pair combined again to draw Everton level shortly before the interval. Séamus Coleman weaved his way into the area before releasing Walcott, who centred low from the right for the unmarked Kean to score only his second Everton goal since arriving for an initial £29m from Juventus last summer.Bournemouth could easily have lost their composure, and Kean could have edged Everton ahead but headed Digne’s deep cross tamely at Ramsdale, yet their nerve and their superiority held. Their lead was restored in first half stoppage time when Coleman was penalised for a foul on King and Rico whipped another telling free-kick into the heart of the Everton box. Solanke and Jefferson Lerma stole in ahead of Jarrad Branthwaite and the former Liverpool striker sent a header soaring beyond Pickford.Howe’s side continued to carry the greater threat after the restart and it needed a perfectly timed challenge from substitute Leighton Baines, making his farewell appearance before retirement, to prevent Wilson converting from 12 yards out. Bournemouth would not be denied a third, however. Stanislas, a late replacement for Solanke, exchanged passes with King on the left before advancing into the Everton area and squeezing a low shot under Pickford’s weak guard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0beed20f9bc826aed082dac5d4cca8d02d24f978/0_218_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7d018810a83dcb53d9c3b3932a88b16","title":"leicester manchester united premier league match report","story":"When Manchester United signed Bruno Fernandes at the end of January, they were fifth in the Premier League and trailed Leicester in third by 14 points. After a fraught season finale at the King Power stadium, Fernandes’s team held on to a third-placed finish, breaking Leicester’s hearts in the process and, fittingly, it was Fernandes that struck the decisive blow.The midfield signing from Sporting Lisbon has still to lose a league game in United’s colours and his tenth goal for them, from the penalty spot, was enough to make the difference.The spot-kick was awarded for a foul by Jonny Evans on Anthony Martial – he was booked for the challenge – although Wes Morgan also looked to get a piece of the United striker and the move had stemmed from a through-ball from, you guessed it, Fernandes. It was United’s 14th penalty award of the league season – a competition high – and Fernandes, with a saunter and a hop, never looked like missing.It was not one of the 25-year-old’s better performances but he has the priceless knack of finding a way through and the frustration was too much for Leicester to bear. They had known that victory would have given them a Champions League finish – most likely at United’s expense – and Evans felt the red mist come down late on, being sent off for a dangerous lunge at the substitute, Scott McTominay.There would be further pain for Leicester when Kasper Schmeichel tried and failed to dribble around another United substitute, Jesse Lingard, who took great delight in finding the empty net. It was his first league goal since the win at Cardiff in December 2018 – which was Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s first game in charge – and United could celebrate loudly upon the full-time whistle. After looking dead and buried at the end of January, they have fashioned a route back into the Champions League.In time, Leicester will reflect on an excellent season and Europa League qualification. This was not that time. After only two wins in nine games since the league’s restart, they have seen the dream slip away.Leicester had sorely wanted this game to have been played in front of a home crowd and yet, usually for post lockdown football, there was a bit of feeling from the stands. Every Leicester tackle or positive action was greeted by loud applause from the club’s directors and support staff. There was bellowed encouragement for those in blue and, if it was hardly the kind of thing to discomfit United, it certainly reflected what was at stake.Rodgers persisted with three at the back and there was a pleasing intensity to his team’s pressing. United were passive at the outset, they looked nervy and Leicester harried them into a series of errors.Nemanja Matic was guilty of the first, playing a poor pass as United tried and failed to build from the back. Leicester worked the ball quickly to Wilfred Ndidi who shot high from the edge of the area. The home team also threatened when James Justin read a Paul Pogba pass and sprang the impressive Kelechi Iheanacho forward on the counter. He shrugged off Pogba’s attempts to tackle back and kept on running before working David de Gea.Leicester moved the ball better in the first half, they were more aggressive in the one-on-ones and they could be frustrated that they had nothing to show for it at half-time. Youri Tielemans stabbed a low shot just wide and Harry Maguire did enough to put off Jamie Vardy following a cross from the 19-year-old, Luke Thomas.United struggled to settle. Pogba had hung out a risky leg at Iheanacho inside the area early on and Matic bailed out Harry Maguire after the captain lost the ball under his studs, with Iheanacho lurking.Where was the drive and cohesion from United? Evans stopped Martial with a good challenge on 21 minutes before Solskjær’s team enjoyed a brief flurry before the interval. Justin misread the bounce of a spinning ball over the top from Pogba, allowing Marcus Rashford a glimpse at goal – he curled high – while the forward also drove at the near post following a corner. Schmeichel stood tall.The 0-0 suited United but they had no margin for error. Nor did Leicester and the challenge for them was to maintain their first-half levels. They could not. Matic got Martial in with slide-rule through-ball only for Justin to tackle back and after Vardy had flicked a looping header from a Tielemans free-kick against the angle of post and crossbar, Fernandes got Martial away and United had what they wanted.The move had stemmed from Mason Greenwood robbing Hamza Choudhury and Leicester, despite creating chances for the substitutes, Harvey Barnes and Demarai Gray, had no way back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/addb41378cf6abf6bc18edc665a9af2d0edf6f75/5_0_2790_1676/master/2790.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92d282e26682626d4ab3ebbda7ffa34e","title":"arsenal v watford premier league live","story":"Watford conceded a first-minute penalty and it went downhill from there, despite a bright performance and a string of chances against a poor ArsenalAnd with that I’m going to check out. Congratulations to Aston Villa for surviving, to Manchester United and Chelsea for qualifying for the Champions League, and to Liverpool for being magnificent champions. Bring on next season (12 September, if you’re asking). Bye!And Andy Hunter saw Bournemouth seal three points but fall short of safety at Goodison Park:It was on the long walk out of Goodison Park towards the temporary changing room behind the Park End Stand that Bournemouth discovered their five-year residence in the Premier League was over. Eddie Howe’s side delivered as they had to, ending Everton’s 11-game unbeaten home run and recording the club’s first ever win at Goodison, but there would be no helping hand from elsewhere.Bournemouth thoroughly merited the win that ended Carlo Ancelotti’s own unbeaten home run as Everton manager but the damage had been inflicted before their arrival on Merseyside. Four points from a possible 24 since the restart had left the visitors reliant on slip-ups from Aston Villa and Watford in their bid for survival. They were not obliged. Josh King, Dominic Solanke and Junior Stanislas all scored to give Bournemouth a fourth away win of the season but, with news of Villa’s point at West Ham filtering through as they headed off the pitch, this was a triumph greeted in almost total silence.Much more here:Jonathan Liew was at the London Stadium to see Aston Villa clinch salvation:The full-time whistle blew. One or two of the Aston Villa players let out a roar of celebration, only to be swiftly hushed by manager Dean Smith, warning them the job was still contingent on results elsewhere. For two agonising minutes, Villa’s entire playing squad and staff huddled together, awaiting news from the Emirates Stadium. Suddenly, the huddle exploded.Yes: when the smoke had finally cleared from the longest Premier League season of them all, it was Villa who were still standing. They have clung to the precipice with fraying fingernails and fraying nerves, with reserves of patience and grit perhaps even they were not quite sure they possessed. They looked doomed for much of the season. But they were not.Much more here:Here’s Nick Ames’ match report from the Emirates:Some of Watford’s players sank to their knees others made for the tunnel without a moment’s delay. The whistle had just blown on their five years in the Premier League and nobody could say that, when the occasion demanded they hurl the kitchen sink at Arsenal, they did not go down without a fight. Their caretaker manager, Hayden Mullins, cajoled an insistent performance from his players but it was not enough despite a string of opportunities coming and going throughout. In the end they paid the price for seeing the game slip beyond them in the first period, when below-par opponents scored three times, and the consequences will be severe.One poor season may not wreck an empire, but nor do the foundations put in place by the Pozzo family offer any kind of guarantee that they will sail straight back up from the second tier. It is hard to escape the sense that their habit of flipping managers has caught up with them perhaps, in dispensing with Nigel Pearson, they had hoped a fresh bounce would see them through but the theory was finally disproved here and there will surely now be turnover among the playing staff too. Abdoulaye Doucouré and Ismaïla Sarr, who was almost unplayable at times, would grace far better teams.Much more here:The other moment Bournemouth were relegated. Eight points from their last four games was enough to save Aston Villa, but I do think (as I may have said earlier) lady luck has taken a bit of a shine to them. The moment Bournemouth were relegated. If this goal had been given (and nothing else had happened any differently), Villa would just have been relegated, and the Cherries would have stayed up:Finally, Deeney is asked if there’s a chance that he won’t recover from his knee injury:I’m not that old, you cheeky bastard. No, it’s just a clean-up. I’ve been playing for the last month with a knee injury. Hardly training, just wanting to help the boys. My knee is what it is. Do I give up? No. You know me, you know my back-story, you know where I’m from. I’m going to keep going to the end. If it’s next week, if it’s two years from now, I’m going to say I had a good time and made my kids proud, and that’s all that mattered.A bit more from Deeney. He’s not saying that he’s going, and I would guess that given that he’s 32, there’s a short close season and he’s about to have a knee operation it’s unlikely. It’s also interesting that on a couple of occasions he gores out of his way to praise Arsenal, as if trying to make amends for the whole cojones business:I’ve got a knee operation that I’ll probably be having next week. Then we’ll see. Clubs can go in different directions, players can go in different directions, it’s what happens. I’m not saying that is my last game, but if it is my last game, I’m happy I gave everything I can. I’m a simple man. I look in the mirror when I get home, ‘Did you give the best version of you today?’ Yes. ‘Was it good enough?’ No. That’s it. You go again. I’m not going to take any shine away from this great Arsenal team, this great Arsenal club, some good lads here. Things happen in football, people come and go. I’ve been at this club 10 years, if it’s my time to go it’s my time to go. There were bigger and better players here before me, there’ll probably be bigger and better players after.Troy Deeney speaks to Sky:You’ve got to look at the bigger picture, it’s not today, it’s not last week, it’s a reflection of the past year. We’ve not quite been good enough, at both ends of the pitch. It’s heartbreaking for the people who work behind the scenes. We feel sorry for them. I’ll take the stick on social media, but the harsh reality is that people will probably lose their jobs off it, because we haven’t been good enough. As players we have to take that. As a club and as a team we go again.Ultimately we haven’t been good enough. There’s no point dancing around it. The whole club from top to bottom will do an audit, we’ll look at where we’re at, and we’ll reassess. It’s not just us, I think Bournemouth and Norwich will be doing the same thing. It’s part and parcel of football. But obviously when it’s me people are going to enjoy it a bit more.He’s asked if sacking three managers is one of the reasons for their relegation:Course it is. We can’t say that we got it right, because ultimately we failed. It is what it is. But the bigger thing is for fans and people at clubs, they’ll be here long after the players. We have to appreciate that fans will be hurt, they’ll be angry and annoyed, and you have to take it. From a personal perspective, I don’t know if this is going to be my last game for Watford. You don’t know what the future holds.“They created enough chances to win two games of football,” says Graeme Souness of Watford. “They must have had half-a-dozen rock-solid chances today. If that’s a mirror of their season: they defend badly, create chances and don’t take them, that’s why they’re going down.”And that’s pretty much the state of it. Though without creating that many chances.“At least we can only play City twice maximum next season,” writes Jonathan Denness, presumably a Watford fan. Silver linings and all that.“People are going to attribute Watford’s relegation to the fact that they changed manager so many times during the season and over the past few years,” writes David Wall. “I’m not sure, it might be true, but given that Norwich and Bournemouth have both been relegated despite keeping the same manager (and every season teams that keep their manager get relegated) I wonder if it might be a red herring. In all cases perhaps the real reason is just poor recruitment squad building. And that can happen whatever the managerial hiring policy.”They haven’t been relegated because they kept changing managers, they’ve been relegated because they kept appointing the wrong managers (that and never signing defenders).Watford did lose today, but they produced their finest attacking performance for many a long moon, and could very easily have won. This is what happens when you give Deeney someone to attack with. The tragedy is that it took until the final day for anyone with team-picking responsibilities to realise this. Perhaps they’d have survived if they’d only got rid of Nigel Pearson sooner. This isn’t a joke, by the way: Pearson was completely wedded to his 4-2-3-1 formation, which simply couldn’t fail badly or often enough to be rejected. Deeney has toiled for months, lonely and hopeless, flicking balls on to nobody. Today he was excellent. It wasn’t a coincidence.Ladies and gentlemen, your final league table:Heurelho Gomes, Watford’s unused substitute goalkeeper, leaves the field in tears. This is, presumably, the final game of the 39-year-old’s professional career.Other than the occasional ludicrous defensive calamity Watford played really well today, and made more than enough chances to have won comfortably.

The game wasn’t a classic but it doesn’t matter really. It’s been like a mini-tournament since the restart, and it shows: we’re a bit tired, leggy, and I think everyone can see we’re not the same as we were early on. But we had to go for it, and now they’ve done it. “These boys are looking more and more like a Man United team – the Man United way. You play with no fear, you go for it. Today we could have sat back and played for a draw but that’s not in the DNA of the club. Just go for it.“Qualifying for the Champions League means better opposition and bigger games next year. We need to step it up, definitely, because we can’t rest players like we could in the Europa League. We need to get fitter, stronger and more robust.“As a club, we expect to be in the Champions League. We always had great faith in ourselves. At the start of the season we were far too inconsistent, dropping silly points. We’ve been a lot better of late, and to come from an unpromising position shows great character.“It was the exact game I thought it would be today. It was a nervy, edgy game but we deserved the three points. To finish third in this league should be a minimum requirement for this club. Next year we need to keep improving.” Manchester United lost 2-0 at home to Burnley on 22 January, and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was apparently a walking P45. Then they signed Bruno Fernandes, and they are unbeaten in the Premier League ever since: P14 W9 D5 L0 F29 A7. They are still light years away from Liverpool. But they have come a fair way since 22 January, and even further since they lost at home to relegated Cardiff on the last day of last season. If they can sign a few good players in the summer - Grealish, Upamecano, Partey, Sancho, Beckenbauer, Netzer, Royston Keane and Royston Race - they will be in with a shout next season.Peep peep! Manchester United are back in the Champions League. It was a day when the result mattered far more than the performance, and that’s probably a good thing because United were miles from their midsummer best.One of their worst players, the weary Bruno Fernandes, still had the personality to score a nerveless second-half penalty that gave them a vital cushion. Jesse Lingard sealed the victory with an open goal in injury time, his first goal since 1974, and his team-mates could not have been more thrilled for hin.Kasper Schmeichel dawdled on the ball and was robbed by Lingard, who gleefully tapped the ball into the empty net. It’s his first Premier League goal since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s first game as part-time manager in December 2018.Astonishing things always happen on the last day of the season: Agueroooooooooo, Oldham’s great escape in 1993, Newcastle 5-1 Spurs in 2016 and all that. But this surely tops the lot: Jesse Lingard has scored a goal.90+6 min Leicester are now without their entire first-choice back four.90+5 min I’m sure Evans will apologise to McTominay after the game. Truly, I don’t think he’s that sort of player. But it was a disgraceful tackle.He has been given a straight red for a poor tackle on Scott McTominay. My first thought was that it was a second yellow but Martin Atkinson brought the red card out straight away. Replays show why - it was a scandalous tackle, a potential legbreaker. Evans knew it and walked straight off the field.90+4 min “Afternoon Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “So Matt Dony is in ‘a friends garden’, is he? Next he’ll be telling us he’s a devilishly handsome twenty-something who paints, plays the piano, has two degrees, does part time modelling, and looks after sick animals in his spare time. Like me.”90+3 min Evans is penalised for fouling Maguire as they jump for Gray’s free-kick.90+2 min Williams is booked for fouling Gray, who has been excellent since coming on as substitute. Kasper Schmeichel has come forward for the free-kick.90+1 min Five minutes of added time.90 min Pogba is booked for delaying a Leicester free-kick.90 min Leicester are running out of time. It’s been a miserable end to the season for them, but it shouldn’t disguise how well they have done. Nor we should forget they are without three of their usual back four and James Maddison today.87 min Scott McTominay has replaced Bruno Fernandes for Manchester United, and Leicester have brought on George Hirst for Luke Thomas.85 min The corner is headed away by Maguire. When the ball is tossed back in, Evans is penalised for fouling Pogba, who ends up carrying him on his back at the far post.84 min Gray’s free-kick hits the top of the wall and goes behind for a corner.84 min Maguire fouls Vardy 25 yards from goal, slightly to the left of centre. Gray wasn’t booked a moment ago Matic was for a foul in the build up.83 min They almost got one of those goals through Demarai Gray. He cut inside from the right and drove a good low shot that nicked off Maguire and whistled just wide of the far post. The referee gave a goalkick, and I think Gray was booked for his protests.82 min United are happy to pass down the clock down. A reminder that Chelsea 2-0 up against Wolves, so Leicester need two goals.80 min It’s not over, this.79 min: What a chance for Wes Morgan! Thomas’s cross found him in an absurd amount of space on the penalty spot, but his attempted volley connected only with the freshest Leicester air. Moments later, Vardy heads onto the roof of the net from a right-wing cross. That wasn’t much of a chance Morgan’s was.78 min “Can we talk about Fernandes’s penalty style?” says Matthew Richman. “It’s been beautifully predictable: watch the keeper move, roll it into the other corner. Le Tissier, Cantona, Hazard all had the same approach and I don’t think I ever saw them miss five between them.”It’s also more extravagant than those three, with the skip beforehand, which increases the potential embarrassment if you miss.77 min United make their first change. Jesse Lingard replaces Mason Greenwood, who has worked hard on the right wing without having any opportunities to bust the net from 20 yards.75 min: Chance for Barnes! A low cross from the right takes a couple of deflection and drops in no-man’s land on the six-yard line. Barnes gets there first and hits a shot on the turn, but it’s a meek effort that goes straight into de Gea’s grasp.74 min Evans was booked the penalty incident, so Martin Atkinson must have decided it was his foul. It’s the right answer but with the wrong working.73 min Leicester make a triple change before kicking off. Dennis Praet, Demarai Gray and Harvey Barnes replacing Tielemans, Albrighton and Choudhury.72 min Time for the drinks break.It was a really cool penalty from Fernandes. Schmeichel danced left and right but Fernandes still did his little jump and then send Schmeichel the wrong way.United are in front!PENALTY GIVEN! Bruno Fernandes will take it.Evans definitely got the ball but Morgan fouled Martial a split-second before that, so the penalty should stand.PENALTY TO MANCHESTER UNITED! Evans has been penalised for a lunging tackle on Martial. I think Evans got the ball, on reflection, but Martial may have been fouled first by Morgan. It’s a tough one for VAR to overturn, certainly, as I can’t see a clear and obvious error.68 min “Wales, reporting in,” says Matt Dony. “Socially distanced in a friends’ garden, with beer and pizza. Not exotic. Keeping it real.”67 min Bruno Fernandes muffs a relatively straightforward pass to put Rashford through on goal. Fernandes has been really poor today I’m sure it’s fatigue.65 min “Hi Rob,” says Peter Oh. “This match has Vardy winner in the fourth minute of stoppage time written all over it.”64 min If United do lose, and whether it’s fair or not, they will be slaughtered for their passive performance.63 min United look like they have unconsciously settled for 0-0. Lindelof is booked for a needless lunge at Vardy.62 min To the relief of all at PGMOL, the corner comes to nothing.61 min Thomas’s angles a cross towards Tielemans, who mistimes a difficult volley onto his standing foot and behind. The referee gives a corner. We’ll hear plenty about that if it leads to a £50m goal...60 min: Vardy hits the bar! Tielemans curled a flat free-kick towards the near post, where Vardy twisted his neck to help the ball on towards the far post. It looped over everyone and dropped onto the angle of post and bar.59 min Greenwood commits a needless foul on Perez, 20 yards from goal on the left wing. Tielemans will take the free-kick...58 min Leicester’s first change: Ayoze Perez replaces Kelechi Iheanacho.58 min Greenwood slips a through pass to Martial, and Schmeichel hares from his line to claim the ball just in front of Martial. That was superb goalkeeping."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4aa57afa9bb4c7d94827b8a1f004cee7836c3d41/224_288_2751_1652/master/2751.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9a2e6a270fd44c68d3c5a7c89f2ede2","title":"premier league final day clockwatch live","story":"Aston Villa’s 1-1 draw at West Ham was enough to see them survive, sending Watford and Bournemouth down, while Manchester United beat Leicester to pip them for a Champions League spot, while Chelsea’s win over Wolves took them there tooSo there we go: it took a while, but the 2019-20 Premier League is in the books.We’ll see you for more, er, tonight, when Juventus play Sampdoria, again for the Championship play-offs, and again for the start of next season. It’s been (extremely, unprecedentedly) emotional. Ta-ra, mates.James Redknapp has just called Ziyech “Zye-etch”. Of course he has. “Even if Mourinho was joking (and I can’t be the only person who suspects an undercurrent of ‘hahaha but seriously guys’),” says James Humphries, “then in all fairness he is still tedious in the extreme, so, y’know, riff away.”I actually think Mourinho really needed this. For a bit it looked like we were seeing his cycle on warp, and as a consequence, Daniel Levy would have a decision to make. My guess now is that he’ll think he doesn’t, which might not be a great long-term situation, but if he can find his old genius and enthusiasm, you never know. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is happy. He says to get to third from where they were is a “wonderful achievement” from his players. They didn’t play well today, he says, but learning to win games like this is an important staging post. He had to stick with his team because he had to for it, and his team looks more like “a Man United team”, who he says “just go for it”. “We need to step it up,” he says of being the Champions League, and notes that he can’t rotate in that competition as he did in the Europa, and his players need to “get fitter, stronger and more robust”. The club - they know what I feel we need,” he says, noting in unspoken parentheses that it’s not what the Glazers feel they need. “As an Atlanta United supporter,” tweets @MiddleAgedSpidey, “I’m going to claim ‘the Skip’ for King Josef.”Harry Maguire tells Sky United dipped so much from good to bad performances in the first half of the season, noting how bad his team were at defending set-plays. He says they’ve improved a lot at that, though still messed it up against Southampton, and also notes the arrival of Fernandes. He doesn’t note Pogba and Martial’s injuries, but those made a hige difference too. Let’s have some reports...“Southgate must be dropping Pickford now,” tweets Bobby Moore, “especially with both Pope and Henderson consistently doing well. He might be good enough for mid-table Everton, but surely not for an England side aiming for the business end of tournaments?”Yup, agree. If his best was better, maybe, but it isn’t, which makes him a liability. “What a joyful league table for the mathletes,” says Lars Bøgegaard. “Number three ends up with excactly 23 of the points of number one. Bravo!”And an embarrassment for everyone but number one. Wolves’ failure to take anything from Stamford Bridge is yet another example of Mourinho’s omniscient genius. Wolves, meanwhile, have to hope Chelsea beat Arsenal in the cup final. A squad with players this good ought to be above this fate, but here we are. That’s a great result for Chelsea, who now have a cup final to look forward to (and a trip to Germany, in order to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit. Schmeichel, who was out of his goal trying to score a minute ago, rolls a careless one to Lingard, who punishes home his first of the season! Well! Who picked that two weeks ago? 99 points for the champions. Imagine their joy of they’d got one more. Too little, too late by the looks of things. Villa have two minutes to survive, to survive....Marooned on the ground, he introduced studs to shin, matter of principle stuff really. McTominay is down, but will be fine he’s gone, and he can’t really argue with that. “The original skipper in the peno run up was john Aldo Aldridge!!” says Anto O’Connell. “As the young people say YouTube it!”I’m old enough to remember watching it, but that was a stutter, for mine. At the KP, we’re into the second of five minutes of injury time....Norwich do not escape with a light 4-0 dusting. That’ll teach them for taking the lead. I’m sure in thefullness of time, this will be an own goal, but whatevz Yarmolenko shoots from just outside the box, it flicks off a defender’s leg, and describes a perfect parabola, looping over Reina and in! Can Villa hold it down?JACK GREALISH HAS DONE IT! JACK GREALISH HAS DONE IT! THE CAPTAIN HAS DONE IT! He takes a square pass just outside the box, left of centre, drags the ball down the side of the defender, enough to make space and angle for the shot, then flings everything he’s ever been, everything he’s ever known and everything that exists in the world into a rising, screeching cry for freedom, and Villa are staying up!

Then, coronavirus arrived and working from home became vital to keeping many businesses afloat.So, how can you convince your employer to make flexible working the new normal? Here’s the evidence you need …Working from home worksA global pandemic is nobody’s idea of a perfect backdrop for a major change in working practices, but in spite of the obstacles, millions of office workers have transformed into home workers and our jobs are still getting done. Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey has even told his 5,000 employees they can choose to work at home forever. “We want employees to be able to work where they feel most creative and productive,” explained a spokesperson. Bhutta isn’t surprised. “OK, we didn’t choose this situation,” she says. “But flexibility is clearly available in many more jobs than had been advertised on that basis. We need employers to ask themselves, has there really been a significant drop in productivity? I think they’ll find employees have been doing their best in very challenging circumstances.”People are working smarterA huge amount of time during the office working day is wasted on interruptions and unnecessary meetings. “We all know the stress of presenteeism, of having to sit in a meeting room for an hour while someone drones on – it drains activity,” says Tracey Follows, founder of the strategy consultancy Futuremade. “Working from home allows you to take control of how and when you use your energy,” she says. This in turn can lead to increased efficiency.It makes employees happy You want to jump on a video call from the park? Download documents at the beach? Thanks to Vodafone’s unlimited data, you can. Helping employees to achieve a better work-life balance is an obvious way to support them and encourage their loyalty. “Flexible working means the employer gets an engaged, happy employee who is able to concentrate on their job while they’re working because they can also plan for the school pick-up or to visit elderly relatives,” says Bhutta. “When people have autonomy they are loyal and committed, which leads to benefits in terms of productivity.”The traditional office is outdatedOne look at the deserted skyscrapers in our cities shows that it’s time to retire any romantic attachment to Mad Men-style central offices. Especially now that screen partitions between desks, regular deep cleaning and one-way traffic systems will need to be implemented to help prevent future waves of coronavirus. Offices could well transform into occasional spaces where people meet for training days or to collaborate on projects. Even the CEO of Barclays Bank, Jes Staley, has acknowledged that “the notion of putting 7,000 people in a building may be a thing of the past”. While, sadly, this might signal the end of the office biscuit tin, it could save employers hundreds of millions pounds in annual office costs.Businesses can access more talentSaying goodbye to the traditional office means an opportunity to welcome in new staff, talent and ideas from all over the world. “Flexibility opens up the workforce to many more people,” says Follows. “It gives opportunities for talented people who live far from big cities, who are from different socioeconomic backgrounds or have disabilities. It’s an opportunity to be grasped.”Employers get to be human tooDuring this crisis, thanks to all the video meetings, we’ve got to know our colleagues and bosses as actual people who have overloaded bookshelves, home schooled kids and cute puppies in their lives. Employers have become relatable, not just an intimidating presence at board meetings. “Seeing people’s kids and dogs popping up on video calls has meant that people’s responsibilities have become visible in the world of work, in a way that they weren’t before,” says Bhutta. “It’s been a real opportunity to see people beyond their role at work. And that’s something we don’t want to turn the clock back on.”From uninterrupted video meetings to deciding when and where you work best, getting the most from your mobile data has never been more important.Keep connecting with our unlimited data plans.

And it’s a trend that’s set to continueIt doesn’t take a statistician to work out that we’ve all been online a lot in the last few months. From home schooling and streaming to ensuring your household has all the essentials (which may or may not have been purchased from Deliveroo), the number of gigabytes we’ve used and the time we’ve spent online has ticked ever upwards.But exactly how much more are we online now? What’s using up most of our data? And what will happen as lockdown ends? Turns out it does take statisticians to work all that out – which is why we’ve looked at their reports to compile this list of five facts about you, the internet and your data usage. You’re welcome.1. In lockdown, we’ve each been online for four hours and two minutes a dayYou always knew you had it in you to be a record breaker, didn’t you? You were right. According to Ofcom’s new Online Nation 2020 report, an annual survey looking at how the UK’s internet usage is changing, the four hours and two minutes we’ve averaged online during lockdown is a new high. And it’s an increase of 37 minutes a day per online adult compared with January 2020.Even without lockdown, we’ve been using the internet more than ever before. In the past year before we were locked down, we were online for 17 minutes a day more than the previous year. The biggest users? 18 to 24 year olds, who logged on for an hour more each day than adults overall.“That’s one of the more interesting stats that we found,” says Jory MacKay, RescueTime’s marketing manager. “This means that essentially each time you look at your phone you’ve got a 5050 chance of setting off a chain reaction of phone check ins.”5. Why unlimited data deals are great for familiesYou know that feeling when your work Zoom call’s audio goes so robotic and stuttery it’s like a Daft Punk remix? And on investigation, it turns out that the rest of your household is variously streaming video, online gaming and generally draining so much of your bandwidth that they might as well have attached a tap and be dispensing pints of it in the street?“As households are doing their learning, communicating, streaming – everything – online, that puts more pressure on the home internet,” says Gilani. “One answer is to have your own separate connection – whether through your phone or a dedicated mobile broadband connection – which means you can do what you need to do without interrupting what the rest of the family does. You can then get on with client calls while another family member is playing Fortnite.” In a pandemic, these are good problems to have.Staying connected has never been more vital – and it often seems that everyone in the family wants to be online at the same time.

Thousands of university students have been forced to return to their childhood bedrooms after their first taste of freedom was well and truly curtailed. Younger teens have had school unceremoniously cancelled, and others have not been able to leave the house at all due to health concerns. But the good news is, with lockdown easing, things are finally changing.Here three young people, with very different experiences of lockdown, describe what life feels like now they are recovering some of their much-yearned-for freedom …‘Our phones are what connect us’Anya, 19, BristolI always thought the phrase ‘absence makes the heart grow fonder’ was a bit of a cliche but my boyfriend and I are absolute proof that it’s true. Luke and I have been a couple longer in lockdown than out of it. We met in January and went from sleeping at each other’s houses five nights a week to not physically touching each other since 16 March.I have cystic fibrosis so I have had to shield at home with my mum we even disinfect food packets when they come into the house. But despite our physical distance, Luke, who’s 23, and I are closer than ever. These extraordinary times have meant we can really focus on getting to know each other at a deeper level. He makes me feel good and takes me away from the mundanity of every day. We’ve had the time and space to really talk about what’s important to us and best of all we make each other laugh.In early lockdown we’d FaceTime from the moment we woke up to when we went to sleep. I’d walk around the house with him in my hand Mum got totally used to him being here with us and has got to know him too. We’d even have date nights watching the same film on Netflix from our bedrooms.More recently we’ve made our first tentative steps into the outside world together, albeit still being physically apart. We have to take things slowly as I’m still shielding but I have driven over and had a barbecue with his family in his garden, even if I do take my own chair and plate and cutlery to be safe.We are taking it a day at a time but for now, I’m so relieved he is always by my side thanks to our phones.‘My friendships mean more to me than ever’ Carrie, 14, MacclesfieldFriendship has become even more important since March. I speak to my best friend Yaz most days and if I didn’t have her I don’t know what I’d do. We just get each other.I get on really well with my family but you talk to friends in a different way. I’ve used my phone more since lockdown than ever before. But when you’ve suddenly had all your freedom taken away it’s hardly surprising. I spend hours chatting on social media or FaceTime. Some days I look back and see I’ve been on my phone for eight hours.Before lockdown hit I loved my own space. I’m a keen mountain biker so I’d be out in the woods with friends or hanging out at mates’ houses, or a coffee shop.Now lockdown has eased, I’m out and about more so I use a lot of data. I go mountain biking and while there are more people on the trails we always do our best to socially distance. I like to meet friends in the park or go to a place nearby to wild swim. I always have my phone to reassure my mum I’m safe.But I miss socialising without having to think so carefully about it. I never thought I’d say it, but I can’t wait to go back to school.An unexpected bonus of this year is I’m getting on really well with my brother Dan, who’s 18. We used to bicker but now we really talk to each other. The other day he even invited me to join his friends around the firepit in the garden.‘I’m finally getting some freedom back’George, 21, Bishop SuttonThe second year of university is known as the party year, you’re in the swing of student life, there are no exams and just plenty of socialising and nights out. So I never imagined I’d be driving back to my family home at 1am on a March morning, as lockdown hit, and then spending the majority of the year back in my childhood bedroom. It has been hard to take, as up until March, I hadn’t spent more than three weeks consecutively at home since finishing my A-levels. On the plus side, I have enjoyed being close with my family again.I’m studying modern languages at the University of Oxford and suddenly my academic world has been taken completely online with seminars and tutorials. It has definitely been a challenge getting used to a new normal but I’m trying to remain positive.One benefit has been changing the way I work. When I was at uni it was like we were always working, doing snippets here and there. But now I’ve learned to work more intensely and so I get the work done faster. It means I have more free time.While I’m not seeing much of my uni friends I’m finally able to get out and catch up with local friends. We’ve met up for fish and chips near a local lake and have enjoyed river swims and socially distanced drinks at the harbourside. When the weather is good, life almost feels normal again as we sit in parks and chill together.But we can’t be spontaneous any more, we actually have to plan to meet up. In the old days we would just float around town and see who was around. I’m certainly more reliant on my phone and it’s useful having unlimited data. I’m used to crashing at a friend’s house if I’m visiting but now I have to think about getting home instead.It’s my year abroad next year and I’m lucky as I have got a job and am heading to Berlin. For those who are staying here, university is going to feel very different.When you can’t see the people you care about as much as you’d like, staying connected is more important than ever.

It took me years to find out why The place looked like something out of an old horror film: all paint-chipped walls, dusty windows, and menacing shadows cast by moonlight. I walked through a gate, up a flight of creaking steps, and knocked on the door.When it swung open, a woman in her 30s with woolly eyebrows and oversize white teeth welcomed me inside. She asked me to take off my shoes, then led me to a cavernous living room, its ceiling painted sky blue with wispy clouds. I took a seat beside a window that rattled in the breeze and watched through jaundiced streetlight as others walked in. A guy with prisoner eyes. A blonde woman with an off-centre bindi on her forehead.I’d come here on the recommendation of my doctor, who’d told me: “A breathing class could help.” It could help strengthen my failing lungs, calm my frazzled mind, maybe give me perspective.For the past few months, I’d been going through a rough patch. My job was stressing me out and my 130-year-old house was falling apart. I’d just recovered from pneumonia, which I’d also had the year before, and the year before that. I was spending most of my time at home wheezing, working and eating three meals a day out of the same bowl while hunched over week-old newspapers on the couch. I was in a rut– physically, mentally and otherwise. After a few months of living this way, I took my doctor’s advice and signed up for an introductory course in breathing to learn a technique called Sudarshan Kriya.At 7pm, the bushy-browed woman locked the front door, sat in the middle of the group, inserted a cassette tape into a beat-up boom box, and pressed play. She told us to close our eyes. The voice instructed us to inhale slowly through our noses, then to exhale slowly. To focus on our breath. I kept breathing, but nothing happened. No calmness swept over me, no tension released from my tight muscles. Nothing. Ten, maybe 20 minutes passed. I started getting annoyed and a bit resentful that I’d chosen to spend my evening inhaling dusty air on the floor of an old Victorian house. I thought about getting up and leaving, but I didn’t want to be rude. Then something happened. I wasn’t conscious of any transformation taking place. I never felt myself relax or the swarm of nagging thoughts leave my head. But it was as if I’d been taken from one place and deposited somewhere else. It happened in an instant.There was something wet on my head. I lifted my hand to wipe it off and noticed my hair was sopping. I ran my hand down my face, felt the sting of sweat in my eyes and tasted salt. I looked down at my torso and noticed sweat blotches on my sweater and jeans. Everyone had been covered in jackets and hoodies to keep warm. But I had somehow sweated through my clothes as if I’d just run a marathon.The instructor approached and asked if I was OK, if I’d been sick or had a fever. I told her I felt perfectly fine. The next day I felt even better. As advertised, there was a feeling of calm and quiet that I hadn’t experienced in a long time. I slept well. The little things in life didn’t bother me as much. The tension was gone from my shoulders and neck. This lasted a few days before the feeling faded out.What exactly had happened? How did sitting cross- legged in a strange house and breathing for an hour trigger such a profound reaction?I returned to the breathing class the following week: same experience, fewer waterworks. I didn’t mention any of it to family members or friends. But I worked to understand what had happened, and I spent the next several years trying to figure it out. Over that  of time, I fixed up my house, sorted myself out and got a lead that might answer some of my questions about breathing. I went to Greece to write a story on freeing, the ancient practice of swimming hundreds of feet below the water’s surface on a single breath of air.“There are as many ways to breathe as there are foods to eat,” said one female instructor who had held her breath for more than 8 minutes and once ed below 300ft. “And each way we breathe will affect our bodies in different ways.” Surely someone had studied the effects of this conscious breathing on landlubbers? I found a library’s worth of material. The problem was, the sources were hundreds, sometimes thousands, of years old.Seven books of the Chinese Tao dating back to around 400BC focussed entirely on breathing, how it could kill us or heal us, depending on how we used it. Even earlier, Hindus considered breath and spirit the same thing and described elaborate practices that were meant to balance breathing and preserve both physical and mental health. Then there were the Buddhists, who used breathing not only to lengthen their lives but to reach higher planes of consciousness. Breathing, for all these people, for all these cultures, was powerful medicine.I looked for some kind of verification of these claims in more recent research in pulmonology, the medical discipline that deals with the lungs and the respiratory tract, but found next to nothing. According to what I did find, breathing technique wasn’t important. Many doctors, researchers and scientists I interviewed confirmed this position. Twenty times a minute, 10 times, through the mouth, nose or breathing tube, it’s all the same. The point is to get air in and let the body do the rest. But I kept digging and slowly a story began to unfold. As I found out, I was not the only person who’d recently started asking these questions. While I was paging through texts and interviewing freeers and super-breathers, scientists at Harvard, Stanford and other renowned institutions were confirming some of the wildest stories I’d been hearing.But their work wasn’t happening in the pulmonology labs. Pulmonologists, I learned, work mainly on specific maladies of the lungs – collapse, cancer, emphysema. “We’re dealing with emergencies,” one veteran pulmonologist told me. “That’s how the system works.”No, this breathing research has been taking place elsewhere: in the muddy digs of ancient burial sites, the easy chairs of dental offices and the safe rooms of mental hospitals. Not the kinds of places where you’d expect to find cutting-edge research into a biological function.Few of these scientists set out to study breathing. But, somehow, in some way, breathing kept finding them. They discovered that our capacity to breathe has changed through the long processes of human evolution and that the way we breathe has become markedly worse since the dawn of the industrial age. They’d also discovered that with some concerted practice we could restore our breathing and when we did we could take control of certain functions of our nervous and immune systems. The ways in which we took those 25,000 breaths we take each day – some 30lb of air that enters and exits our lungs – was in many ways as important as what we ate, how much we exercised, or whatever genes we’d inherited.Since I began researching my book several years ago, attitudes towards the importance of breathing have altered radically. Covid-19 has turned us into a planet of breath-obsessed people. We spend our days covering our mouths and noses with masks, our nights anxious that we might be feeling a cough coming on or some tightness in our chests. As hard as it might be to consider right now, there’s a silver lining in all this. How we breathe may help with health and longevity and paying attention to it is long overdue. Several doctors told me recently that respiratory health has been directly correlated to Covid survival rates and they are now prescribing breathing practices to better defend our bodies against this virus as well as help us better overcome it once we start showing symptoms.A video posted by Dr Sarfaraz Munshi, who is on the frontlines of the pandemic at Queen’s Hospital in London, shows Munshi taking abdominal breaths followed by a short breath-hold, then repeating it five times and ending with a cough. This technique, he suggests, will help purge gunk from the lungs and make for easier breathing. Although there is no scientific evidence to suggest this technique helps coronavirus patients, it is recommended by the director of nursing at the hospital.What I’d like to make clear is that breathing, like any therapy or medication, can’t do everything. Breathing fast, slow, or not at all, can’t make embolisms go away. No breathing can heal stage IV cancer. These severe problems require urgent medical attention. But, like all eastern medicines, breathing techniques are best suited to serve as preventative maintenance, a way to retain balance in the body so that milder problems don’t blossom into more serious health issues. Should we lose that balance from time to time, breathing can often bring it back. Add to this, researchers still have much to learn about this endlessly expansive field and there should be more in-depth scientific research into the area.For now, most of us see breathing as a passive action, something that we just do: breathe, live stop breathing, die. But breathing is not binary. It’s not just that we do it that is so important – how we breathe matters, too. I call this awareness and practice of healthy breathing a “lost art”, because it’s not new at all. Most of the techniques I’ve been exploring are ancient. They were created, documented, forgotten and then discovered again in another culture at another time, then forgotten again. This went on for centuries.One thing that every pulmonary researcher I’ve talked to over the past few years has agreed on is that we tend to overbreathe. What’s considered normal today is anywhere between a dozen and 20 breaths a minute, with an average intake of about 0.5 litres or more of air per breath. For those on the high end of respiratory rates, that’s about twice at much as it used to be. Breathing too much can raise blood pressure, overwork the heart and lull our nervous systems into a state of stress. For the body to function as peak efficiency we need to breathe as closely in-line with our metabolic needs as possible. For the majority of us that means breathing less. But that’s harder than it sounds. We’ve become conditioned to breathe too much, just as we’ve been conditioned to eat too much. With some effort and training, however, breathing less can become an unconscious habit.Through my years of travels and travails in respiratory research, there is one lesson, one equation, that I believe is at the root of so much health, happiness and longevity. I’m a bit embarrassed to say it has taken me a decade to figure this out and I realise how insignificant it may seem. But lest we forget, nature is simple but subtle. For me, the perfect breath is this: inhale for about 5.5 seconds, then exhale for 5.5 seconds. That’s 5.5 breaths a minute for a total of about 5.5 litres of air. You can practise this perfect breathing for a few minutes, or a few hours. When we breathe like this, breathing practitioners suggest that circulation in the brain and body will increase while the burden on the heart decreases. All the while the diaphragm – that umbrella-shaped muscle in our chests – will drop lower and rise higher, allowing more air to enter the lungs and assisting in pushing blood throughout the body. For this reason, the diaphragm is sometimes referred to as “the second heart”, because it not only beats to its own rhythm but also affects the rate and strength of the heartbeat.Breathing techniques in the form of classes, videos, books and apps are already an industry. But be aware that the stripped-down approach is as good as any. It requires no batteries, wifi, headgear or smartphones. It costs nothing, takes little time and effort, and you can do it wherever you are, whenever you need. It’s a function our distant ancestors have practised since they crawled out of the sludge 2.5bn years ago, a technique our own species has been perfecting with only our lips, noses and lungs for hundreds of thousands of years.Most days, I treat it like a stretch, something I do after a long time sitting or stressing, to bring myself back to normal. By the law of averages, you will take 670m breaths over your lifetime. Maybe you’ve already taken half of those. Maybe you’re on breath 669,000,000. Maybe you’d like to take a few million more.Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art by James Nestor (Penguin Life, £16.99) is published on 30 July.

But as soon as you lift your face and taste the fresh tang of salt on the air, you will mark how this sky is as different, fickle and changeable as all you have left behind. Then, if you listen, you will hear the laughing gulls. And beyond that, heading off in a low V-shape, the haunting call of the geese.I have lived in the Hebrides for more than 16 years – the first years with my husband, and for the past decade with my dog, Maude, alone. I had been dreaming of staring out at a raw, open horizon for years – ever since I found an old map of Scotland and pinned it up in the hallway in my London flat. It was positioned across the full length of a narrow wall where I always saw it as I was passing, at an angle where your eyes fell into that empty space between giant masses of land. It is always during that notion of transit, of passing from one space to another, that your heart opens and all of your dreaming begins. I would press my nose to that thick paper, inhaling its musty scent, as my finger traced the ragged coastline of the fractured islets and islands. In those moments, as my eyes closed, the traffic, shouts from the street, neighbours slamming doors, would evaporate into the hurl of fresh spindrift, the thick, curling crests of the breakers drenching the salt-stung air, the gulls tearing the skies apart with an aching, screaming call.I had loved my early years in London. I lived in Notting Hill, in a flat with an iron gate leading out on to communal garden. It was a sanctuary in the heart of the city, with a buzzing, cosmopolitan local community on tap. I was there years before the film came out, when you bought your vegetables in a brown paper bag with cash, knew all the street vendors, got your cigarettes from the cashier at the toy shop on the corner of Kensington Park Road. It was a time of hope and dreaming of your beautiful life, and Britpop singing the world real again.But in London, neighbourhoods are transient and can shift as quickly as the low skies gusting overhead. Suddenly, there was a disconcerting invisibility to the formerly gregarious community and a disheartening, unsettling and desolate feeling that permeated the streets. People started walking more quickly, heads bowed, barely meeting your eyes. Humanity is a vulnerable, vigilant thing. Our building was spray-painted with graffiti, windows were broken, the police were called. One day, arriving home, I screamed as I walked into the back garden. The plants were torn apart, some that were flowering had been uprooted. I fought tears as I looked into the pond. Cans of paint had been poured over the wall, the containers left floating in the water. Hidden in the reeds were the faded, bloated corpses of our beautiful, bright little fish. Something died in me that day.A neighbour was mugged, then another knocked to the ground. I stopped walking around the neighbourhood. Those weeks were a tense, nail-biting time when everything became dark and feral. Worn down by months of this, I started waking in the night, feeling breathless, my heart thudding. Stress is invisible subtle and insidious, it builds up over time. Anxiety is like a smouldering fire. All it takes is a scream, a moment of fear, to whip those flickering embers into burning flames.It was the fall of silence that struck me. It had a porous feel to it, as if the sky had been spilled into it until there was room for little else. No raised voices, no bricks through the window. No rattling of sticks on a metal grille, or buses thundering past. Inside, there was a stillness like cool, clear water. And I knew that it was this quiet that I had been seeking for so long. It did not matter that the cottage we had moved our lives into had no water, electricity, outside drains or paint on its walls. It did not matter that there was no heating or insulation. Nor that it was as freezing cold inside as it was outside, with just a single stone grate in one end wall. It did not matter that it was unloved and had not been lived in for five years.I will never forget the day I travelled to start my life on the island. Arriving alone, as a stranger, was one of those unnerving twists of fate that only holds a deeper resonance in later years. I like to think it was my first test of facing my fears and putting my trust in the unknown. Looking back, I had no idea that those early years would only be the start of a fiercer, wilder, intensely difficult period that would tax my courage, resilience and endurance to breaking point and beyond. Growth is not always easy, and sometimes a new seed has to be encouraged, even forced, to grow.The island is barely 12 miles long, its narrow girth tightening to half a mile, with close to 140 residents, another 10 or so renting temporarily. I had not planned to be here alone. We arrived as a couple and at first we were happy. When my husband left, the challenges began. I was grief-stricken and struggling to cope. My father had only recently died and my mother had been diagnosed with a terminal illness. I was still shattered by devastating loss after years of infertility, up to my neck in crippling debt and unable to work, struggling to function. My confidence was drained I had broken both of my hands in two separate accidents, and simple tasks became overwhelmingly difficult. I felt helpless. Then my best friend – a woman I had met on the island – was killed in a car crash.Grief is like soil. It is heavy and clings to your skin when you come up for air. Sometimes even after you have brushed it off it is suddenly there again, miring you in something dead and weighted and dark.For a few years, solitude became all my life. When I lived in London, solitude was synonymous with relaxation. It meant a pause or vital decompression, a moment of balancing, a slow drawing of breath – an experience to be savoured. It was never so internal as to be a state or frame of mind. I looked forward to it – time set aside to allow something restricted inside to free itself. On the island, my experience of isolation was frightening because it so quickly normalised – a clear, cold wind of solitude that I used to love now wrapped around me, a constant presence. I began to notice I was often shivering, how the days felt cold. Isolation is a process of self-harming. You do not wish to go there, but over time it feels a safe place to be. It is addictive.I have always been sociable and, in London, was used to being surrounded by company. I knew something was wrong when I felt unable to connect with others on the island. I kept trying to reach out, but it was as if some inner inhibition was blocking me, so each encounter hurt, like a bruising collision. Authentic connection is made more difficult when you are living alone, at a distance from close friends and family. I found myself searching others’ eyes like a moth seeking a light – but my eyes were always too wanting or hopeful. Over time, those collisions felt increasingly sharp, abrasive.When I was most isolated, I was also coping with an acute yet chronic respiratory illness and my immune system collapsed. Each intake of breath felt like inhaling tiny shards of glass. One winter night, I forced myself out of the house. I stood alone, wrapped in blankets, shivering in the darkness. It was such a comfort to look up and feel that great breathing night sky around me, eyes wide, gazing into a dark glittering universe of stars. It helped me to take a breath, force myself to stretch out, to release that suffocating inhibition. That night, I lifted my arms and asked for help. I was aware of feeling some mysterious reciprocity of kindness. Something inexpressible in the immense darkness answered me.Now I embrace solitude. For the past four years, at dawn, I have run across the hills to the sea. It was the sea that helped me break that cold silence inside. Each day I throw lost hours into the water. It renews my strength, fires resilience inside and gives me a sense of gratitude for my warm breath and beating heart. I never used to like cold water, yet here I have grown to love its shocking, icy embrace. Every day, whatever the weather, I rise early and head for the shore. I have not missed a day, regardless of storms and punishing Hebridean conditions. I have swum in snow, in freezing rain with thick ice particles obscuring visibility, in crisp sunshine and in dense mist, and once with the wind chill dipping to -16C and the solid, crackling edges of the sea freezing.Standing on the shoreline as the waves come barrelling towards you helps you to step into all you normally draw back from. Cold water swimming takes you beyond resistance. It invites you to ask, “What else do you fear?” It forces you to tackle all in your life that has a stronger undertow. In the water there is no place for fear. I used to tell myself, “Soon I will stop.” Eventually, I realised I didn’t want to. It gets me up to set firm boundaries. It teaches stamina, courage, inner resilience and buoyancy. Sometimes you think you have nothing left to give, and then it asks for more, so you give more of yourself than you ever imagined was possible. If I can stand bare-skinned in the freezing cold, hurl myself into the waves and keep swimming, then I am winning.Solitude helps you to redraw your own parameters, but its navigation takes skill and practice. Immersed in nature, you learn to look to the tides, winds, weather, currents, and raw elements more closely. That knowledge becomes instinctive. When I am alone, I am more focused and attuned to the particular nuances and subtleties in the natural world around me. Life is simplified. You feel your own humanity, physicality and interconnectedness acutely.These days, life runs calmly. I have dear friends and close community, yet I still value and actively make space for my own solitude. I still do not have family, kin, children, so I have learned to fill that space with different, other lives. Now I understand how isolation and often the most shattering experiences in life are so important. The profound depth of our suffering holds all kinds of hidden truths. Nature is regenerative. Everything has to break down in order to renew.Each morning, as I wake to the dawn sky and the sun rising over the mountains, the sound of the wind and weather is a familiar, loved presence. I always sleep with my window open. If I listen, I hear the buzzards and a great silence of mountains beyond. It is quiet when I go downstairs. There is always a quality of stillness that is only felt in an old house. In winter the power still goes off and so the early mornings start with candlelight. I rarely eat alone. Wild birds often fly in the open windows. They sit perched on a gnarled hazel twig that swings tied to a branch I use as a curtain rail. We sit and watch each other as I talk to Maude, pressed close against my legs.When you immerse yourself deeply into nature, exposing yourself to discomfort and risk, you recalibrate more sensitively to unseen patterns and rhythms. You feel your own pulse and breath instilled with a peace and calmness. The rugged landscape becomes hewn differently, takes on more intimate contours. Immersed daily in the sea, swimming in all weathers, it is interesting how other aspects of your life start adjusting to this routine. Tasks are organised differently, more closely aligned to the bigger cycles of sun, moon and tides and seasonal shifts. Some call this biodynamic living, and it makes sense. It connects the unique solitude of every animate or inanimate sentience, and connects it to an expansive, interconnected universe.That realisation came to me one early dawn. It was freezing, the depths of winter. I stripped off and ed into the waves. Out in the channel, the wind had dropped and snow, long promised, started to fall. Then something happened that changed my life. A wilder voice called my name with love and changed me forever. Afterwards, all it takes is a breath to reconnect to the pulse and beat of the universe. Once that feeling is experienced, it is impossible ever to feel alone.

Next month, Bradfield releases his second solo LP, Even in Exile, with lyrics written by the Welsh poet Patrick Jones.How has lockdown been for you?I didn’t leave my corner of Cardiff for months, or see my dad every week, as I always do, so that was hard. He’s 77, and still working as a gravedigger. I’ve also got young kids, eight and four, so I’ve been like the headmaster patrolling the corridors at home. I’ve also been running a lot while listening to music: lots of the Bad Plus, Public Enemy, George Benson, Rush, old C86 compilations. Blondie are amazing to exercise to. You imagine yourself being caught between punk and Jane Fonda.How would you describe Jara’s protest music?It’s quite shocking at first because it’s very beautiful and graceful. It shows that protest music doesn’t have to be someone shouting “Motherfuckers, stand down!” Even in American protest music from the same time, by Bob Dylan or Phil Ochs, there are moments when they go four-to-the-floor, straight in the eye. Not here. Jara shows us that protest music can be a psalm or a prayer to be more inclusive, or to understand history a bit more. That feels right for today. After all, you don’t have to find your enemy to have a fight any more, do you?You’ve lived back in Wales for a decade. Wales’s devolved government has a more cautious approach to Covid-19 than England. How have you felt about that?Strangely proud. Looking at pictures of our beaches next to England’s and going: “Yes! We’ve stuck to the rules!” I was like, ah, this is what it’s like to feel old.Your home valleys were also one of the biggest Brexit-voting areas in the UK. Why, do you think?Because politicians based their referendum campaigns on hectoring and preaching. Look at anyone who wins an election, whether it be Clement Attlee or Margaret Thatcher – you shouldn’t mention those two names in the same breath, of course – they built their victories on addressing people’s hopes and fears. Wales’s government have done well in their response to the virus for similar reasons, and, importantly, they’ve not scared people too much. Unless you’re a mad, rightwing libertarian who has a problem with wearing a face mask, that is. That’s beyond the realms of my thinking.What do you think of punk-rock bands today, like Idles, who talk about politics onstage?I think there’s been a generational shift. I never felt we were qualified for it – I remember being criticised for not speaking up about the Iraq war, and saying we wanted to let the songs speak for us instead. It’s not that I think speaking up is wrong – I liked Red Wedge a lot in the 80s – but I’m not sure musicians telling people who to vote for is going to help. It worked for us to talk about books we liked, or artists and thinkers, and excite fans that way. For me to preach about politics right now would be like watching a dad at a disco doing a drop-shoulder move.In April, the Manics announced a free gig for NHS workers this December. What drove that decision? Obviously, we planned it on a hope and a promise, and all promoters have second and third dates planned in. But we really wanted to give these people a party. We know so many friends and family members working in the NHS who have suddenly had to learn to live very complicated lives. They’re run ragged, and it’s horrible. Also, I don’t want to stereotype, but people who work in hospitals love a good lash-up. They need it! The only people I’ve seen worse are ballet companies on tour – these huge, tattooed, pierced roadies from south London would always warn us about them – or the time we crossed over with the Riverdance company.

She even suggested the parties could build a joint campaigning force where it benefited them.In an interview with the Observer, the Oxford West and Abingdon MP said she was best placed to overhaul her party’s relationship with Labour. Successive Lib Dem leaders have ruled out coalitions with Labour or the Tories since the party’s electoral collapse following its coalition with the Conservatives under Nick Clegg, but Moran said she would not rule out such a deal with Keir Starmer. However, she suggested ending first past the post would be a prerequisite.She called on activists within the two parties to consider forming a “huge campaigning force” to help each other at the next election. She said she wanted a “Paddy plus” arrangement with Labour, in reference to the close relationship between former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown and Tony Blair before the 1997 election.Voting to decide who will replace Jo Swinson, who lost her seat in the 2019 election, begins this week.Moran’s manifesto, launched this week, includes support for a universal basic income. However, she rejected the idea that the Lib Dems would be to the left of Labour under her leadership. She said that unlike her rival Davey, who was a minister in the coalition government, she was best placed to build a constructive relationship with Starmer and Labour.“That coalition hangover means that the vitriol between the parties is really palpable. I would love to get to the point where that heat was taken out of the relationship between Labour and the Lib Dems, because that would also help actually achieve something that’s greater than all of this stuff, which is frankly tactical – which is a kinder, gentler politics in our country that is less isive and generally more respectful.”She said the past decade for the party had “clearly been disastrous”, attacking the party’s support for revoking Brexit.

A tiny piece of Martian basalt the size of a 10p coin will be launched on board a US robot probe on Thursday and propelled towards the red planet on a seven-month journey to its home world.This extraordinary odyssey, the interplanetary equivalent of sending coals to Newcastle, will form a key part of Nasa’s forthcoming Mars 2020 expedition. Space engineers say the rock – which has been donated by the Natural History Museum in London – will be used to calibrate detectors on board the robot rover Perseverance after it lands and begins its search for signs of past life on the planet.“When you turn on instruments and begin to tune them up before using them for research, you calibrate them on materials that are going to be like the unknown substances you are about to study. So what better for studying rocks on Mars than a lump that originated there?” said Professor Caroline Smith, the Natural History Museum’s curator of meteorites.Scientists were confident that the rock they were returning to Mars originated on the planet, added Smith, who is also a member of the Mars 2020 science team. “Tiny bubbles of gas trapped inside that meteorite have exactly the same composition as the atmosphere of Mars, so we know our rock came from there.”It is thought that the Martian meteorite was created when an asteroid or comet plunged into the planet about 600,000 to 700,000 years ago, spraying debris into space. One of those pieces of rubble swept across the solar system and eventually crashed on to Earth. That meteorite – now known as SAU 008 – was discovered in Oman in 1999 and has been in the care of the Natural History Museum since then.Among the instruments fitted to the Perseverance rover is a high-precision laser called Sherloc, which will be used to decipher the chemical composition of rocks and determine if they might contain organic materials that indicate life once existed – or still exists – on Mars. The inclusion of a piece of SAU 008 is intended to ensure this is done with maximum accuracy.“The piece of rock we are sending was specifically chosen because it is the right material in terms of chemistry, but also it is a very tough rock,” added Smith. “Some of the Martian meteorites we have are very fragile. This meteorite is as tough as old boots.”Once Perseverance has selected the most promising rocks it can find, it will dump them in caches on the Martian surface. These will then be retrieved by subsequent robot missions and blasted into space towards Earth for analysis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5517ba601fbd185e89a836425864983b26a0289e/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5123e53c6b3194408405d797cdece4e","title":"public sector workers in england share your thoughts about the new pay rise","story":"We’d like to hear from teachers, doctors and other public sector workers about their thoughts on the pay increaseAlmost 900,000 doctors, police, teachers and other public sector workers in England will receive above-inflation pay rises to reflect the “vital contribution” they make.Labour and trade unions welcomed the move, announced by the Treasury, but warned that the increases would not make up for lost incomes under the previous public sector pay freeze.

Frank Hill, 60, said he remembered watching footage of Lewis and other civil rights marchers being beaten.“I had to come back and see John Lewis cross the bridge for the last time,” Hill told the Associated Press. “It’s funny to see the state troopers here to honor and respect him rather than beat the crap out of him.”As the wagon approached the bridge, members of the crowd shouted “Thank you, John Lewis!” and “Good trouble!”, the phrase Lewis used to describe his tangles with white authorities during the civil rights movement.Some crowd members sang the gospel song Woke Up This Morning With My Mind Stayed on Jesus. Later, some onlookers sang the civil rights anthem We Shall Overcome and other gospel tunes.The wagon rolled over a carpet of rose petals, pausing atop the bridge over the Alabama River in the summer heat so family members could walk behind it. On the south side of the bridge, where Lewis was beaten in 1965, family members placed red roses that the carriage rolled over, marking the spot where Lewis spilled his blood and suffered a head injury.As a military honor guard lifted Lewis’ casket from the horse-drawn wagon into an automobile hearse, Alabama state troopers, including some African American ones, saluted.Calls to rename the bridge for Lewis are increasing.On Sunday Kerry Kennedy, a human rights campaigner and daughter of the former US attorney general, senator and presidential candidate Robert Kennedy, with whom Lewis forged a strong friendship, told the : “I think it would be great because Edmund Pettus was a terrible white supremacist and there should not be anything named after him.”Pettus was a lawyer and Confederate general who became a US senator and leader in the Ku Klux Klan.“It would be a symbol to Selma and to our country and to the world that we recognise the violence of the past,” Kennedy said, “and we are going to atone for it and we are on our way to becoming a more perfect union – one where all people are respected and where every person is treated with dignity.”After the ceremonies in Selma, Lewis’ body was taken to the Alabama capitol to lie in repose, retracing the route marchers took in the days after Bloody Sunday to demand justice from Alabama governor George Wallace.Bertha Surles and Edna Goldsmith stood along the highway between Selma and Montgomery. Both carried signs, reading “Thank you”.“He fought for rights up unto his death,” said Surles, 70.She was in high school on Bloody Sunday and remembered watching footage of Lewis being beaten.“They didn’t give up and something good came from it. Still need some improvement, but something good came from it.”“John was willing to sacrifice life so we can have the freedom to vote,” said Goldsmith, who was wearing a Black Lives Matter shirt. “We want to see him off with a bang.”A series of events began on Saturday in Lewis’ hometown of Troy, Alabama. He will lie in state at the US Capitol in Washington next week before a private funeral on Thursday at the historic Ebenezer Baptist church in Atlanta, which the Rev Martin Luther King Jr once led."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7797ba4ab4ce5e8d625333b291531ecfff5c86a6/200_276_3982_2390/master/3982.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a32a02bea709b5641d8b81b9c116db8","title":"shielding in england how do you feel about going back to work","story":"We’d like to hear from people who have been shielding about their thoughts on returning to workFrom 1 August, those who have been shielding in England will be able to leave their homes to exercise, buy food and visit places of worship for the first time since March.They will also be able to return to work, rather than continue to work from home, as long as their place of employment is ‘Covid-secure’.If you have been shielding during the lockdown and are returning to work from August, we’d like to hear from you.How do you feel about retuning to your workplace after shielding for four months?

She has taken an enormous load on herself,” Kolesnikova said.Protests in support of opposition candidates are the biggest challenge in years to Lukashenko, amid anger over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and grievances over the economy and human rights. As well as jailing his main election rivals, he has detained hundreds of people in a crackdown on dissent.Tikhanovskaya has also had to make sacrifices. Last week it was revealed that she had taken her children out of the country for their own safety, after she had nearly been driven out of the race by threats against her family. Her husband, Sergei Tikhanovsky, remains behind bars for taking part in a rally in May.“Yes, I was scared at first,” she said in a televised speech. “I know what depths this government can go to in order to preserve its place. But I am no longer scared.”At boisterous campaign rallies, Tikhanovskaya and Kolesnikova have been joined by Veronika Tsepkalo, a former Microsoft employee and campaign head for her husband, Valery Tsepkalo, who has also been turfed out of the race and fled the country with his children to Moscow last week, saying he had been warned that an order had been put out for his arrest.In a bombshell announcement this month, the three women said they would be uniting their campaigns, connecting what are seen as complementary electorates between wealthier urban voters and opponents of Lukashenko in the countryside.Lukashenko, a former collective farm director, has ruled the ex-Soviet country since 1994, suppressing and jailing opposition figures and holding elections not deemed free and fair by European observers. He is widely expected to use his influence over the electoral authorities to help win the August elections and the opposition has said they are worried that the vote could be rigged.Kolesnikova said they hammered out the decision to unite in just a quarter of an hour. “We decided it would be quicker for just three of us to talk,” she said. “We needed 15 minutes talking just the three of us, Svetlana, Veronika, and myself, in order to make a decision … And that was our victory.”The optics of the announcement also caught the public imagination. In photographs, together, Tsepkalo flashed a peace sign, Tikhanovskaya held up a fist and Kolesnikova formed her two hands into a heart. A surge of fan art has followed.“We believe that we are not of a second sort, that we stand equal to men and believe that we can win,” said Tsepkalo after the announcement, in a dig at Lukashenko, who has said politics should remain a sphere dominated by men.“Our constitution is not made for a woman,” he said. “Our society hasn’t matured to the point to vote for a woman.” He also referred to them as “poor things”.Tikhanovskaya has embraced her role as a reluctant candidate, saying she is not interested in running for politics but is doing so from a sense of duty.“I love my husband so I am continuing his cause,” she told a crowd of several thousand voters in a stump speech in Barysaw on Thursday. “I love my children and want them to grow up in a country where people don’t have their mouths shut. I love Belarusians, so I want to give them the possibility to choose.”She also appeared speaking in fluent English on a BBC report in a segment that so angered Lukashenko that he called for the news agency to be tossed out of the country, along with local reporters for RFERL."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0e9e4f5b85c3dd869b85a087992277f44872a58/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6fe4051774cffe3fc3e1000a2f79a01c","title":"moscows fruit stalls become frontline of a border skirmish 2000 miles away","story":"New violence between Armenia and Azerbaijan has provoked anger and boycotts throughout the two countries’ diasporasWhen Saribek Gevorkyan heard reports that Food City, a vast food distribution centre owned by entrepreneurs from Azerbaijan, had suddenly blocked Armenian farmers and turned away 50 truckloads of fresh apricots, he took action. He offered space for free in his own shopping centre to the farmers, helping to host a fruit rescue mission that its organisers have dubbed “Operation Apricot”.“We told our friends that in the Russian Federation nobody can close their doors to us Armenians,” boomed Gevorkyan, the owner of the Shelkovy Put (“Silk Way”) shopping centre. “The Russian Federation is open for everyone to come here, make money, and sell goods.”This month’s military clashes between Azerbaijan and Armenia, which left 17 people dead including a prominent Azeri general, were the worst in four years. Their aftershocks have rippled around the world, sparking violent skirmishes among diaspora communities in the US and Europe and a small-scale economic war in Moscow.The violence appears to be getting worse. In Moscow, Russian media reported that at least 25 people were arrested in a mass brawl late on Thursday night. Video footage appeared to show a group of men targeting the drivers of cars with Armenian licence plates. One Armenian man was reportedly stabbed during the attacks.Video also showed men with sticks storming an Azerbaijani restaurant in Moscow and an Azerbaijani fruit seller was also reportedly attacked. Members of both diaspora communities, as well as the Armenian embassy, have called for restraint.There have been a few hopeful moments. To save the freshly harvested apricots from spoiling, organisers in Moscow’s Armenian diaspora sent out an online alert on behalf of several shopping centres that had given free space to the farmers to sell their stock.The online messages attracted thousands of people, launching an impromptu celebration of the apricot, an Armenian staple. At one shopping centre, people danced a traditional kochari as buyers lugged away crates of fresh fruit.“It turned into quite a beautiful city festival,” said David Tonoyan, who helped organise the campaign. He said that many of the apricots went to charities, hospices and old people’s homes. “It had the effect to bring us closer together in the diaspora.”Asked by the Observer whether Food City had turfed out Armenian sellers, God Nisanov, the chairman of its parent company, Kievskaya Ploshchad, wrote that “following Russian law is an unconditional priority”, and that the company has “continuously demonstrated its care about the interests of consumers, partners and tenants regardless of their nationality or religious beliefs”.While the “apricot war” has ended, there are new reports of Azeri-run businesses barring Armenian products. On Thursday, the Armenian ambassador to Moscow told the news site RBC that Armenian canned foods, mineral water and cognac had all disappeared from a major Moscow supermarket chain owned by an Azeri businessman.The two countries have fought often, particularly in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, but it’s rare to see the conflict spill over into commerce in Moscow, where both countries have large diaspora communities.“Even in 2016 during the four-day war with Azerbaijan … there wasn’t this mood in Moscow. This economic war: there’s not been anything like it before,” said Tonoyan, the director of the Armenian Museum of Moscow and Culture of Nations.Experts have warned of a high risk of renewed fighting along the border between the two countries. Richard Giragosian, the founding director of the Regional Studies Centre thinktank in Yerevan, said it could be a “hot summer”.“To rely on political will and the situation on the battlefield for regional stability is dangerous,” he said. “There are no external security guarantees … this is a rare ceasefire that’s upheld only by parties to the conflict without any external actor.”In a new report, the International Crisis Group warns that the clashes “should serve as a warning and call to action”.Tonoyan said that he wanted to do more to protect Armenian farmers and other traders in Russia by helping to organise dedicated selling points.“We asked all Muscovites to come and help out the Armenian farmers, try some tasty apricots, take part in this flashmob and photograph themselves,” he said. “But we all understand this isn’t a permanent solution. So we’re thinking about what’s next.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d354ba3cf5e2e03afcae70d178bd58a2a36cfbe/0_20_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f34068012514a5258d1db5699431a81a","title":"coronavirus live news global cases near 16m covid 19 ad blitz in victoria australia","story":"WHO says 1m cases reported per week for last five weeks Florida’s infections overtake New York’s North Korea holds emergency meeting after suspected Covid-19 case reportedA look at the impact the pandemic is having on the economy in Australia. Texas governor Greg Abbott on the battle to contain the virus.’s technology writers around the world discuss the impact of the pandemic on the industry.Lang Holland, the chief of police in tiny Marshall, Arkansas, believes the threat of the coronavirus has been overstated and only wears a face mask if he is inside a business that requires them. He does not make his officers wear them either. So the day after Republican governor Asa Hutchinson signed an order requiring masks to be worn in public throughout Arkansas, Holland made it clear his department was not going to enforce the mandate in the Ozarks town of about 1,300, calling it an unconstitutional overreach. “All I’m saying is if you want to wear a mask, you have the freedom to choose that,” said Holland. “It should not be dictated by the nanny state.”Holland is among a number of police chiefs and sheriffs in Arkansas and elsewhere who say they will not enforce state-wide mask requirements even within their departments.The pushback is concerning to health officials, who say a lack of enforcement could undermine what they say is a much-needed and simple step that can be taken to slow the spread of the coronavirus.“If people undermine that mandate, they undermine the public health benefits of masking in the setting of this pandemic, and that just doesnt make any sense to me,” said Dr Cam Patterson, the chancellor of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, who had called for a statewide requirement.More than half the states have issued orders to wear masks in most public settings, with virus cases and hospitalisations on the rise. Polling shows overwhelming public support for such requirements, and even President Donald Trump, who had long been dismissive of wearing masks, last week said it was patriotic to wear one.Some reaction from British holidaymakers who have been in Spain.One man from Liverpool who flew back to the UK today said a region-specific approach should have been adopted with the Spanish quarantine measures.James Sloan, 34, said his family-of-five had been on holiday in Mojacar, more than 400 miles from the nearest Covid-19 outbreak in Barcelona. He told the PA news agency: “When we flew out to Spain 10 days ago from Manchester there was an outbreak in Leicester, 100 miles away, but that wasn’t seen to be a problem.“So why is it a problem when our nearest outbreak was 400 miles away from us in Spain?”His wife works as a self-employed doctor and he said she will lose two weeks’ work while they quarantine. He is hoping to be able to work from home.He said: “We knew the risk and we aren’t asking for sympathy, but if they are going to keep doing this, they need to think about a different approach because it is going to have a massive effect on people.”Liz Samandi, 52, a business owner from Leicestershire is due to return from a family break in Majorca on Thursday.She said it was “frustrating” that people already abroad had been given “no choice” in relation to the new rules.“I just feel a bit angry as well actually that they’ve done this and not considered the people that are already here,” she added.The health minister of the Mexican state of Chihuahua, Dr. Jesus Grajeda, has died nearly two weeks after being hospitalised with Covid-19.“I have no words to express all my feelings in this moment, except for profound sadness,” Chihuahua governor Javier Corral wrote on Facebook on Sunday morning, adding that Grajeda had died of heart failure.With more than 385,000 confirmed cases and nearly 43,500 deaths as of Saturday, Mexico has the world’s fourth-highest death toll from coronavirus.Latin America is the region most impacted by the pandemic. The UK’s transport secretary Grant Shapps, who is currently in Spain, will have to self-isolate for 14 days upon his return.Some 500 workers are in quarantine on a large Bavarian farm to contain a mass coronavirus outbreak, German officials said, as they announced free Covid-19 tests for local residents.A total of 174 seasonal workers have tested positive for the virus since Friday, Werner Bumeder, the district administrator of Dingolfing-Landau, told a press conference.Most of the seasonal employees come from Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Ukraine, he said, and had been working in close proximity harvesting cucumbers at the farm in the municipality of Mamming.He stressed the cluster appeared to be limited to “a closed group of people” and had not yet spread to the wider population.The farm’s 480 employees and managers are all in lockdown on-site, with those who have tested negative staying in separate accommodation from those known to be infected.The farm itself has been closed off from the outside world with a security team monitoring the quarantine.Bumeder said the outbreak showed that the farm “did not consistently implement” hygiene regulations aimed at preventing the spread of the deadly virus.One of the infected employees had to be hospitalised.Bavarian Health Minister Melanie Huml said authorities were taking the outbreak “very seriously” and were racing to track down anyone who came into contact with the workers.She said health officials would soon begin mass testing at other agricultural businesses in the region.The UK has removed Spain from its list of safe countries to travel to after fears were raised that the European country was experiencing a second wave of coronavirus infections.It means those returning from the country will have to self-isolate for two weeks upon their return to the UK.The measure came into effect from midnight on Saturday, meaning that from Sunday all returning travellers will have to quarantine themselves for 14 days. It applies to people returning to any of the four nations of the UK - England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Government said the move follows a “significant change” over the last week in both the level and pace of change in confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Spain. The country has reported more than 900 new daily infections for the past two days. People currently on holiday in Spain have been encouraged to follow the local rules, return home as normal and check the Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s (FCO) travel advice pages on gov.uk for further information. The FCO is not advising those already travelling in Spain to leave. Abta - the UK’s travel trade association - has advised customers in the country to continue their holidays and return as normal.  The FCO is advising against all but essential travel to mainland Spain. Holiday operator Tui has said it will cancel all planned holidays to Spain in response to the announcement and customers will be contacted to discuss options. Abta has advised customers due to travel to the country imminently to contact their travel provider. Meanwhile, airline easyJet said it planned to operate its full schedule in the coming days. Quarantine measures will apply to those returning from mainland Spain, the Canary Islands (Tenerife, Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote, La Palma, La Gomera, El Hierro and La Graciosa) and the Balearic Islands, such as Majorca and Ibiza, the Department for Transport confirmed.The Association of British Insurers (ABI) has said it is “likely” that travel insurance will remain in place for holidaymakers already in Spain until they return home. However, those attempting to travel to countries against FCO advice would invalidate their travel insurance. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said no worker following quarantine guidance should be penalised by employers, including by being put onto sick pay.

Photograph:  Tom HonanJaunty white picket fences replaced car-parking spaces on several streets around Dublin’s Grafton Street last weekend, creating new outdoor seating areas for cafes and restaurants.This “continental” cafe-culture scene was facilitated by the pedestrianisation trial of parts of South William Street, Drury Street, Dame Court, South Anne Street and Duke Street, which will be repeated for the coming three weekends.The fencing lent a distinctly more convivial atmosphere than the steel barriers used in the weekend traffic closures at College Green last year, and while the measures are temporary, they gave a sense of how these streets could operate with full-time pedestrianisation.“I would like to see it extended,” said David Pankowski, who was having lunch with his family outside Ukiyo on Dame Court. “The businesses will need this to get back up and running and we were just discussing that it probably will make us come out to cafes more.”Outdoor seatingThe Pankowskis, originally from Seattle but living in Dublin for two years, had been looking forward to restaurants reopening. “We like to eat out, but we are still a little uncomfortable about eating inside restaurants,” Gina Pankowski said, “so this is great, as long as it doesn’t rain”.Over on Drury Street, Elaine O’Keefe, who travelled into town from Lucan, said weather shouldn’t be a barrier to making the scheme permanent.“My partner is from Belgium and the weather is pretty much identical to here and they have outdoor seating all year round. Particularly on a street like this, where there are lots of cafes, it works really well.”Ailbhe Cullen from Newbridge previously lived on campus at Trinity College and said the atmosphere was similar.“When you would go on to the campus the noise would suddenly drop, because the buildings would block the traffic noise, and it very much feels like that here. I really would love to see it continue, I can’t see a reason to have cars back in these small streets.”While the weather was somewhat mixed over the weekend, and restaurants and cafes had not installed umbrellas over the seating areas, the initiative still proved a definite boost for business, according to Karl Purdy, who runs Coffeeangel on South Anne Street.Transformed“We are delighted with it, the street has been transformed. It’s something I pushed on social media out of a sense of desperation, but it turned out that with the city council, I was pushing an open door.”While cafes and restaurants had been permitted to provide takeaway services during the lockdown, there had been very little demand in the city centre, Mr Purdy said.“Dublin 2 is hugely dependent on offices and with people working from home there was no custom, but this is the busiest we’ve been since lockdown.”The feedback has been “unanimously positive” from customers and other businesses on the street, he said. “I think there is a consensus to have it full time. I’ve ordered the umbrellas now, so I’d certainly like to see it made permanent.”Non-food businesses might be expected to be ambivalent, if not wary of pedestrianisation, but Declan Abrahams of Abrahams tailors on South Anne Street said he would be fully in favour of permanent pedestrianisation.“I think it’s terrific. I’ve been here sine 1982 and I had never seen the city so quiet, it took a hell of a battering but this is bringing people back in.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Julien Behal Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has said he accepts that a Cabinet decision to top-up pay for super-junior Ministers is causing “a great annoyance and anger”.Mr Donohoe said he “can absolutely understand the anger this is causing for some”, but urged people to view the move “in the context” of the wider stimulus plan announced by the Government last week. The Government came under sustained attack for what was described as a “devious” change to legislation to ensure the three Ministers of State who sit at Cabinet receive a €16,288 supplement to their pay.The Minister for Finance, who was speaking on the On the Record with Gavan Reilly show on Newstalk, said the changes were introduced because “we have a number of Ministers of State around the Cabinet table that would be paid differently, and we were looking to get to a point where if they were all doing the same work, they’d be paid the same”.“But all that being said, I do accept this is causing a great annoyance and anger for some who are listening to this.”In relation to the Government’s decision to cut the rate of VAT from 23 per cent to 21 per cent for a six-month period, Mr Donohoe said that for retailers “who are very profitable, or are at all profitable, or are at all profitable, I absolutely want this VAT reduction to be passed on.”But I do know there are many other retailers at the moment who are struggling, and if they have a choice between implementing a price cut and then finding the viability of their business is affected or they can’t continue to employ somebody,” he said. In those instances, he said he expected that some retailers will use the VAT reduction to maintain employment.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4314050.1595786111!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pensioner who has climbed croke patrick for 30 years says i just kept coming","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Val Dempsey (73) who has been climbing Croagh Patrick on Reek Sunday for more than 30 years.

Photograph: Ellen O’Riordan Summer would not be complete for 73-year-old Val Dempsey without a venture up Ireland’s holiest mountain on the last weekend of July.From Minane Bridge, in Cork, Mr Dempsey has travelled to Mayo for Reek Sunday for more than 30 years, including in 2015 when pilgrims were warned to stay away due to wild weather.“Once I came here I just kept coming,” he said, sipping a coffee at the mountain’s base next to his wife Mary Dempsey. “There are often days where you come and you cannot see the top of the mountain at all due to the mist. Today the weather is fantastic,” he said.Factoring in Covid-19 restrictions this year, the pair decided to do “just a little bit of the mountain for the exercise and the tradition.” Reek Sunday usually brings thousands of pilgrims - many of them barefoot - to climb Croagh Patrick each year. However, Archbishop of Tuam Michael Neary had encouraged people to attend a local Mass this Reek Sunday rather than take part in the traditional ascent. Echoing the sentiments of local church leaders, gardaí, Mayo Mountain Rescue and locals in Murrisk asked people to stay away after deciding the normal infrastructure and hundreds of volunteers could not be deployed due to Covid-19.John Graham (60) only realised it was Reek Sunday upon arriving at the foot of the mountain. From Belfast, the “regular walker” had not heard the warnings to stay away and has been enjoying climbing a number of mountains as coronavirus restrictions have eased. “It is outside, it is not hard to stay two metres apart,” he said. “ I am fairly risk-averse so I wouldn’t come if I thought it wasn’t safe.”Among those who opted to climb was a group of five men from Co Meath who came to Westport for a weekend staycation. “This has been on our bucket list. I wasn’t aware Reek Sunday existed,” Allan El Atrash (28) said. “If there was some sort of Garda brigade here we would have turned around.”Working at a tea and coffee stand beside the walkway, Jackie O’Grady said the place was “much quieter” than on a usual Reek Sunday.“Usually it is mental. The car park would be full and they have to open fields for extra parking. It would be just crowds and crowds of people,” she said. As the morning wore into afternoon, about 100 people carrying tricolours and “Irish Republic” flags arrived to protest the official cancellation of the Reek Sunday pilgrimage. News of a “rally by the reek” had been spread on social media and encouraged “patriotic pilgrims” to “protect our Christian heritage”. One protester, who gave her name only as Bridget, said she had travelled from Dublin and was attempting the pilgrimage for the first time. She said it was “disgusting” that pilgrims were being asked to stay away. “Why would they stop people from coming?” she asked. Anti-lockdown and anti-immigration activists Gemma O’Doherty and John Waters addressed the protesters, who cheered loudly when told Irish people will “take their country back”.In a lengthy speech about immigration, Ms O’Doherty claimed Ireland’s culture, heritage and Christian faith is being “wiped out” and said people are terrified to question what she called the coronavirus “scamdemic”.After speeches and a rendition of the national anthem, many protesters started to climb.

Photograph: François LenoirAFP via Getty ImagesFirst the Covid-19 lockdown scrapped plans for an April gathering to choose a new leader of Germany’s ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) now the virus may decide who delegates choose next December as a successor to Angela Merkel.The steady pandemic path of the chancellor and her grand coalition in Berlin has had a disproportionately positive effect on the CDU, pushing the senior coalition partner five points beyond its 2017 election to a barnstorming 38 per cent in polls.That success has rubbed off on some CDU figures more than others. Federal health minister Jens Spahn – until now seen as a leadership outsider – is now being pushed as a possible front-runner.Until the pandemic broke, three candidates were in the race: Armin Laschet, minister president of North Rhine-Westphalia Friedrich Merz, a former CDU heavyweight and millionaire lawyer and CDU foreign policy figure Norbert Röttgen.Laschet has had a bad pandemic, leading the vocal charge to loosen the lockdown before his credibility was hit by a virus surge in his state’s meat factories.Merz was runner-up in the last CDU leadership race in December 2018 and, until the pandemic struck, was seen as another strong replacement for the luckless party leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer.But the pandemic has sucked the oxygen out of the Merz media campaign, while a ban on public events has robbed the former politician of a platform to rebuild his profile.A similar fate has befallen Norbert Röttgen. A former environment minister, he has no cabinet post to keep him in the public eye and is now seen as the least likely to succeed.Officially the CDU has paused its leadership campaign, with all leadership hopefuls insisting that public health have priority over political interest or personal ambition.Co-ordinated interviewsThe jostling continued a little more discreetly than before until Friday, when Spahn supporters tore away the thin veil of discretion. In co-ordinated interviews, they insisted the three favourites to date – all over 50 – would hinder a generational shift that only the 40-year-old health minister could deliver.Others suggest Spahn’s “outstanding work” as health minister in the pandemic has made him the first among equals.“I don’t see Jens Spahn in the reticent role he has chosen for himself but clearly at eye level with the other candidate,” said Armin Schuster, a senior CDU figure.Spahn has remained silent for now but, in the past, has made no secret of his impatient ambition.Previous perceived impediments – his youth, lack of cabinet experience, and his homosexuality – have, with time, diminished as issues. But two obstacles still loom large in his pursuit of the CDU leadership.First, in February he entered a political alliance with Armin Laschet, agreeing to keep out of the race if Laschet, as new CDU leader, made him his deputy. With Laschet’s star sinking, it remains to be seen how Spahn\u0026nbsp can extricate himself without political blowback.The first move in this direction came when Bundestag president Wolfgang Schäuble, an influential CDU grandee, dispensed his blessing on Spahn for having”the will for power”.Prince of darknessThe other obstacle is Markus Söder, the Bavarian minister president. Once dubbed the prince of darkness for his love of political intrigue, the 53-year-old has transformed himself during the pandemic into a heavyweight leadership figure.As head of the Bavarian CSU he cannot run for the leadership of its CDU sister party, but his allies say his eye is on the chancellery.In one scenario doing the rounds in Berlin, Spahn would become CDU leader, Söder would be fielded next as Merkel’s chancellor successor while Laschet would be fobbed off with the presidency if he withdraws from the race. Chief problem in this scenario: two previous CSU chancellor bids failed because Bavarians don’t play well in the rest of Germany. \u0026nbspYet Spahn loyalists insist the job-share could work: their man and Söder share a pronounced taste for power and progressive conservative politics, they say, compatible with the most likely coalition partner, the Greens.Five months remain until the CDU chooses its next leader but, just as Covid-19 has reshaped the world of work and the high street, the novel coronavirus appears poised to scramble Germany’s body politic.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"King Abdullah warns move could destabilise not only the kingdom but the entire regionPrime minister Omar Razzaz says Israel\u0026rsquos annexation plan would destabilise regionRampant inflation and 30 per cent unemployment places huge strain on societyHopewell Chin\u0026rsquoono seized as part of a crackdown on anti-corruption protestersIsraeli prime minister still awaiting final approval from Washington for implementation of controversial planGovernment under pressure as initial lifting of restrictions now seen as having been too rapidEndeavour intended to stoke Arab and Muslim pride over rich heritage of discoveryCases confirmed in doctors and nurse with concern virus will move fast through campsHealth officials say country in \u0026lsquodangerous place\u0026rsquo after early success in curbing epidemicSpeculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4312065.1595526228!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barnier says trade agreement unlikely between eu and uk","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson holding  crabs  at Stromness harbour during a visit to the Scottish Highlands and Northern Isles. Photograph:   Robert PerryPA WireBritain’s refusal to compromise on fisheries and level playing field guarantees of fair competition have made a trade agreement unlikely, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator said on Thursday. Speaking at the end of a round of talks in London, Mr Barnier said that although there was some progress in certain areas there was none on the key issue of a level playing field on state aid.“By its current refusal to commit to conditions of open and fair competition and to a balanced agreement on fisheries, the UK makes a trade agreement, at this point, unlikely,” he said.Britain’s chief negotiator David Frost blamed the EU, asserting that its proposals did not respect the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a meeting with the presidents of the EU institutions last month.“Considerable gaps remain in the most difficult areas, that is, the so-called level playing field and on fisheries.\u0026nbspWe have always been clear that our principles in these areas are not simple negotiating positions but expressions of the reality that we will be a fully independent country at the end of the transition period,” he said.Mr Frost said the EU had listened to Britain’s concerns about the role of the European Court of Justice in any future agreement and Britain has dropped its demand for a complex suite of separate agreements like those the EU has with Switzerland. However, the issue of state aid remains a stumbling block, and Mr Barnier complained on Thursday that Britain had not yet published details of the state aid regime it plans to introduce from January next year.“We have no visibility on the UK’s intention on its future domestic subsidy control regime. We respect the UK political debate but the time for answers is quickly running out,” he said.A senior British official close to the talks dismissed Mr Barnier’s demand for details of the state aid regime, and said Britain would not commit to any regime as part of its treaty with the EU.“We’re a bit puzzled by this, to be honest, because we don’t quite see why. What is significant about the subsidy regime compared to lots of other areas of domestic policy? “They aren’t asking us to pre-publish in these areas or to kind of pre-commit to future agreements forever in the treaty. And we don’t really see why this is the case either in this area. All we need is a mechanism to resolve disputes between you if there are felt to be unfair subsidies,” the official said.“We’re not going to pre-commit to a particular kind of regime in the treaty with the EU. That’s just not how we’re going to do things.” Second referendumDuring a visit to Scotland on Thursday, Mr Johnson was met by protesters calling for a second referendum on Scottish independence. During a visit to Orkney and the north of Scotland, the prime minister said the response to the coronavirus had shown the strength of the union.However, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon , who has won praise for her handling of the pandemic, said Mr Johnson should not be exploiting it to make a political point.“I don’t think any of us should be championing or celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives as some example of the pre-existing political case we want to make. This has been a heart-breaking crisis that we’re not out of yet. Too many people died,” she said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Officially, he was removed for failing to deal with issues in the newsroom. But the editor’s supporters said the sacking was “clear interference” and an attempt to pressure the news site to toe a pro-government line.Fears over the future of Index were ignited in March when Miklos Vaszily, businessman that backs prime minister Viktor Orbán, bought a 50 per-cent stake in the firm that controls Index’s advertising and revenue. Although Mr Vaszily denies wanting to exert any editorial influence, his critics claim that he helped transform Origo, another Hungarian website, into a pro-government organisation.Once news of the mass resignation from Index broke, protesters took to the streets in Budapest on Friday evening.Addressing the demonstrators Andras Fekete-Gyor, leader of Momentum, an opposition party, said the “journalists of Index had demonstrated the value of having a moral backbone in this country.”But the protests may have little effect. Mr Orban and his party have a strong position in the Hungarian parliament, and in the past have proved impervious to the frequent accusations that they are undermining Hungarian democracy. The Hungarian government has also always denied that it poses a threat to the country’s free media.Marianna Bíró, a journalist at Index told The Sunday : Today, the political power in Hungary denies the function of journalists. The media only has one weapon left in this massacre: decency.”Balázs Pándi, another employee who walked out, said: This isn\u0027t the first time a cold shower has been deployed. The question is how long this will be tolerated.”Index has become regarded as a bastion of independent journalism in a Hungarian media landscape increasingly dominated by print and broadcast media with close ties to Fidesz, the governing party led by Viktor Orban, the prime minister.The hollowing out of independent media inside Hungary comes amid a push to spread Mr Orban\u0027s message abroad, uncovered today by The Sunday .An investigation found a slew of English-language websites promoting the message and illiberal philosophy of Mr Orban, raising fears that Hungary is following in the “disinformation” footsteps of authoritarian governments.Alleged propaganda websites, with connections to the Hungarian government, masquerade as legitimate news sources, purporting to bring Hungarian and regional news to an international audience.Remix News, one of the websites in question, is, for example, often linked to from the About Hungary Facebook page, which is run by the Hungarian state.Based in Budapest it is, according to its own information, an organisation that offers “news and commentary from Central Europe”. But to its critics it is one of a number of websites with opaque backgrounds allegedly spreading propaganda supporting the government of Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, beyond Hungary’s borders while posing as legitimate news sources.Their presence has prompted allegations that Hungary is following in the footsteps of autocratic regimes such as Russia, Iran and China by using bogus news websites to disseminate pro-government stories.“Hungary has become a regional disinformation power, and certainly Hungary is expanding its own misinformation machinery,” said Szabolcs Panyi, a journalist working for Direkt36, a non-profit investigative journalism centre in Budapest. “I’m not aware of a similar country doing this apart from the likes of Russia and China.”A quick click away from Remix is V4NA. A UK-registered company founded in 2018 by Hungary’s then ambassador to London it turns out stories each day, many of which share a similar theme to those found on Remix. Articles attacking migration, the EU and George Soros, the Hungarian-born financier whom the Orban government regards as an enemy of state, proliferate.The stories reflect issues that lie close to the heart of the Hungarian government. Since coming into power in 2010 Mr Orban’s Fidesz party has become a resolute opponent of migration, a fierce critic of Brussels and Mr Soros, and a proponent of what the prime minister has termed “illiberal democracy”.This has led to frequent clashes with Brussels and prompted widespread allegations that the Hungarian government is intent on eroding democratic norms and civil society in order to shape the country to its ideological designs—something it strenuously denies.“Orban plays to an international field, and he needs international allies in his fight against the EU,” said Agnes Urban, a media analyst at the Hungarian media watchdog Mertek Media Monitor. “This pro-government narrative about Hungary helps communicate his anti-democratic views.Barna Borbas, a Hungarian journalist who has written extensively about V4NA for the conservative newspaper Valasz Online, believes V4NA’s “goal is to make the messages and strategic goals of the Hungarian government more visible in Europe”.This is perhaps not surprising given that Arpad Harbony, one of Mr Orban’s key advisors and man sometimes called the “Hungarian Dominic Cummings”, has a share in V4NA, while V4NA’s parent company is part of the Central European Press and Media Foundation, a media-holding containing a number of pro-government newspapers and radio stations in Hungary. V4NA failed to respond to an interview request from The .Remix is owned by FWD Affairs, a “strategic communications and media agency” in Budapest, founded in 2010 by Patrick Egan, an American political consultant. Although appearing to keep a low profile in Hungary he has spoken at a number of events linked to Fidesz, which are, according to one expert on Hungarian affairs who preferred not to be named, the “darkest chambers of governmental propaganda”.In the past FWD Affairs has also carried out work for the prime minister’s office, winning, for example, a contract in 2015 “to support international communications activities”.Along with publishing Remix it also handles the English-language editing of a Hungarian-state backed website called Transylvania Now. Although designed primarily to promote Romania’s Transylvania region, which was once part of Hungary and still home to a large Hungarian population, the website has political content, often critical of the Romanian authorities while supporting the Hungarian government.Like V4NA, FWD is also a company that appears to shun publicity. Its website consists of one page, and offers no contact information other than a box in which to write a message. It also made no response to attempts by The  to contact it.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pc andrew harpers widow tells endless sprawling dark message","story":"The couple had been married for just four weeks when the 28-year-old police officer was dragged for a mile to his death by the getaway car as he tried to arrest three teenagers caught stealing a quad bike from a house in Berkshire last August.She wrote of the tears in your eyes that only I could see and the sheer happiness radiating from mine… No one will ever know a love like ours.

On paper, he seemed like a character from a James Bond film. He began life as a professional gambler, winning money in Mayfair clubs from, among others, Lord Lucan, Omar Sharif and, indeed, Ian Fleming. He saw the potential in spread betting, establishing the IG Index, and selling it for £90 million in 2003 – prematurely, as it turned out, for the price went on to rise a further 1500 per cent. He made what still stands, 20 years on, as the single largest political donation in British history, giving £5 million to the Conservatives when, under William Hague, they were at their lowest ebb.It could come as quite a surprise to meet the gentle, diffident, stooping figure in the flesh. Stuart, who died this week at the age of 85, was an astonishingly self-effacing man. He gave generously to a number of causes and never wanted anything in return except detailed information on how his money was being used. Asked on live television whether he expected a peerage for his £5 million, he amiably replied that, no thank you, he would decline any such offer if it were made.He pursued his enthusiasms quietly and politely, but with astonishing tenacity. He backed a number of pro-market think-tanks, often sitting in the audience at their events as an ordinary subscriber. He had a particular hatred of torture, and donated huge sums to help eradicate the practice. He was an early Eurosceptic, funding the campaign to keep the pound. When David Cameron dropped his promise of a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, he switched to UKIP, serving as that party’s treasurer. When the referendum itself came, though, he threw his resources behind Vote Leave rather than the UKIP-backed rival campaign.Stuart took immense pleasure in entertaining at Chilham Castle, an exquisite Kentish Jacobean mansion where, among other things, he would host annual outdoor performances by the Royal Shakespeare Company. Some of his happiest times as a young man had been spent as a guest at a country house and, when he sold his business, he decided to recreate that atmosphere himself.Chilham became a kind of Blandings Castle, a place of innocent, almost idyllic, pleasure. Eclectic people would congregate there while Stuart, who was latterly very deaf, would potter about grinning, taking palpable delight in his guests’ pleasure. There would be games, usually Racing Demon (“the only card game where women seem to have a natural advantage”). And there would be a wide range of political opinions for, until his dying day, Stuart never lost the belief that he could learn from people with whom he disagreed.In an age when “party donor” has become almost an insult, Stuart’s story reminds us that there is a fundamental decency and patriotism in choosing to spend your money on good causes rather than on yourself. He measured himself by the palpable difference he made to the world. And, by that metric, he was extraordinarily successful. A gambler to the end, he made a calculated bet on Brexit, and lived just long enough to see it come off. That, for Stuart, was reward enough.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"unions urge ministers consider making face masks compulsory","story":"A fresh row broke out over face masks on Sunday night as teaching unions called for ministers to consider making them mandatory for children in all secondary schools.It came as at least 10 schools decided to break with official Government guidance in order to make face coverings compulsory or strongly encouraged when pupils return in September.Unions said recent announcements requiring the wearing of masks on public transport and in shops had highlighted the need for similar protections to be in place in schools and colleges.Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT teachers\u0027 union, said: The Government\u0027s guidance for schools is now out of step with wider public health guidance and guidance to other employers where it is recognised that, where physical distancing cannot be assured, face masks should be worn.Teachers and other staff working in schools also want to be assured that, when they return to the workplace in September, they will be afforded the same level of protection as other workers, and that the guidance for schools will be brought into line with guidance for other workplaces.Mr Roach noted that Government advice means children over the age of 11 are required to wear coverings when they visit a range of facilities such as shops and banks. He said: So there is a strong argument that face masks should also be made compulsory for children when they return to secondary schools in September.At least 10 schools look set to flout guidance in September, with one comprehensive, Holmes Chapel, in Cheshire, including masks in its new school uniform and directing parents to a designated shop where they can be bought for £3.Fallibroome Academy, in Macclesfield, said it expected students to wear masks in corridors, and Brighton College has told parents the current expectation is that masks would be required when pupils move around the site.Meanwhile, the GMB union has written to Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, urging him to adjust the double standards in the Government guidance on face masks.National officer Karen Leonard said it was plain common sense that teachers and other workers in schools should be able to wear coverings.She said: Changing the rules for buses and shops to enforce the wearing of masks while actively discouraging those working in schools from even wearing them is causing untold confusion.Julie McCulloch, the director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said she expected most schools to follow the guidance but conceded that there is a fair degree of confusion among the public about why face coverings are required in some settings but not in schools.Masks were made a requirement on public transport last month and became mandatory in shops, takeaways and banks on Friday.Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said last week: We\u0027re not recommending masks for schools because if you\u0027re in a classroom with kids all day then a mask doesn\u0027t give you protection.Meanwhile, a new report from the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change argued that people should be ordered to wear face masks in all public environments and called for teachers to be supplied with plastic face shields.A Department for Education spokesperson said: We have set out the controls schools should use, including cleaning and hygiene measures, to substantially reduce the risk of transmission of the virus when they open to all children from September. This does not include the wearing of face coverings as we believe the system of controls laid out adequately reduced the risk of transmission to both staff and students.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/21/15/5.-kiss-you-video-still.jpg","title":"celebrate 10 years of one direction with spotifys new platform experiences","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Calling all 1D stans!

Take a walk at Virginia WaterSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis spectacular destination is only part of a vast, aristocratic pleasure ground of woodlands, parks and meadows that would take weeks to fully explore on foot.The 4.5-mile circuit of the lake takes you past an eclectic mix of attractions, including an ornamental cascade waterfall, Roman ruins brought from Libya and an authentic 100ft-high totem pole gifted by British Columbia.With so much space, there is plenty of room for a secluded picnic too.See windsorgreatpark for more information.2. Cycle the New ForestWhether you discovered a love of cycling thanks to the lockdown or have been a convert for many years, the traffic-free and waymarked trails of the New Forest make it an enticing spot for all levels of rider.If you want to leave your wheels at home, there are plenty of local bike-hire options, which can also provide advice on the best routes for your party – from easy family jaunts to long-distance challenges.See thenewforest for information on cycling routes.3. Hike through the Chilterns Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingChef Tom Kerridge on reopening his Michelin-starred pub safelyAn area of outstanding natural beauty with rolling hills (such as Coombe Hill, above, the highest vantage point in the area), the sparkling chalk streams and ancient woodlands right on London’s doorstep sounds too good to be true, but the Chilterns offer precisely that.With over 300 square miles of scenery and attractions to absorb the crowds, a quiet route is also a walker\u0027s goal. The Chilterns Conservation Board and Chiltern Society have developed a series of 23 walks across the Chilterns which are social-distance-friendly, taking in hill climbs and gentle ambles.Visit chilternsaonb.org for more details about their social-distance-friendly walks.4. Kitesurf at Camber SandsCamber Sands has over two miles of beach to absorb the post-lockdown crowds. The eastern end, marked with black and white flags, is reserved for activities such as kitesurfing, and there is plenty of space for novices to learn how to handle a power kite on land or water.An introduction from The Kitesurf Centre covers the fundamentals and can be booked as one-to-one coaching, as a single group from the same household, or in groups of up to three people from separate households.The nearest train station is in Rye, four miles away. A six-hour introduction to kitesurfing course starts at £99, minimum age 12. See thekitesurfcentre for details.With the pools closed and the seaside crowded, many swimmers are looking elsewhere to take a dip. Far from the chlorinated confines of the local swimming bath, a fresh water reservoir, lake or river can be an exhilarating alternative, but there are many safety issues to consider before getting wet in the wild, so make sure you read up on the hazards first.​See outdoorswimmingsociety for advice and a directory of open-water swimming lakes to explore.6. Learn to jet skiThe beaches could be busy, but you can leave the crowds in your wake after completing a Royal Yachting Association (RYA) personal watercraft course that, in just one day, provides you with all you need to safely helm a jet ski inland or on the coast.There are plenty of places in the UK that can teach you – such as Jetski Safaris in Poole – and no experience is necessary.Visit jetskiandpowerboattraining for more information. Single-person RYA proficiency course for jet skis from £180.7. Ride on an Olympic bike trackThe Hadleigh mountain bike track hosted the London 2012 Olympics and has evolved since then into one of the premier cross-country destinations in the UK.Hadleigh Country Park also provides one of the largest green spaces in Essex, with plenty of opportunities to explore the coast from Southend-on-Sea to Benfleet. The nearby castle ruins offer panoramic views of the River Thames and Kent on the opposite shore.Leigh-on-Sea or Benfleet stations are the closest to the country park. It’s a 10 to 20-minute ride from there to the track. See explore-essex for details.Meet the kayaking instructor...Having been cooped up during lockdown, it’s safe to say that large numbers are wanting to experience the great outdoors like never before now businesses are reopening.“We\u0027ve been ridiculously busy,” says Adrian Fall, below, owner of Brighton-based The Kayak Coach. “People have been so excited about being on the water.”Fall\u0027s passion is teaching people how to kayak, canoe and paddleboard – then leading them on trips up Sussex\u0027s beautiful estuaries and rivers.He set up The Kayak Coach almost 12 years ago and has just taken on two extra staff to add to the three he already employs teaching and guiding on the water: “I love being outside and now\u0027s the time to meet people again and introduce them to the sport I love,” he says.Reopening the business required important changes, as per Government guidelines. Group sizes have been reduced from eight to five to comply with social distancing – “It\u0027s actually a nicer experience for everybody,” Fall adds – and all equipment (boat, buoyancy aid, helmet) is cleaned and sterilised after each use.A one-way system has also been added to its training centre at Ashurst. “We\u0027ve made changes to what we do. But we\u0027re almost back to normal in terms of what we can offer,” Fall explains. Additionally, barrels of water are provided for sailors to wash their hands before and after each session. Fall admits that the past three months of enforced closure have been tough for the business and lovers of the outdoor life, but that people are “having to look locally because they\u0027re not going to France or America”. He adds: “They didn\u0027t know we were here, but they\u0027re excited about accessing the river on our doorstep.”See thekayakcoach for more detailsTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You Go Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots. Keep these four points in mind when preparing for your next staycation…CHECK THE GUIDELINES: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all have different rules in place check their respective tourism sites before you travelBOOK IN ADVANCE: If you’re visiting an attraction, book slots in advance where possibleGO OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: Try to visit less popular places and to avoid overcrowded areasPACK YOUR BAGS: Bring a card for contactless payments and always keep hand sanitiser on youTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You GoPlease keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Zehra Zaidi, a former Conservative parliamentary candidate who spearheaded the campaign, told The Independent the government’s interest is the “culmination” of two and a half years of hard work.

We Too Built Britain campaign group wanted to show inclusive history and all the people from all ethnic and social backgrounds and all walks of life who helped build Britain.Notes and coins – if you see Bank of England and Royal Mint websites – are supposed to reflect those who we feel contributed to our history, economy, and culture as a nation.Our campaign felt an absolute urgency to acknowledge that ethnic minorities have been part of that conversation and achieved so much. We hope it helps build cohesion, inspires young people and unites us as a nation that we all have an equal stake and contribution in society.“Unity now is more important than ever, especially given some of the isions we see online, the isions we have faced post Brexit.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Today we are taking one more step on the road towards giving women a voice and eradicating these harmful practices,” the future prime minister pledged.The unit has been funded through the Department for Education’s children’s social care innovation programme.Since 2015, it has supported more than 1,000 survivors or potential victims of FGM and secured 41 applications for protection orders, which can force the surrender of passports or other travel documents.Around 18,000 social workers, teachers, police and legal professionals have been trained by the centre. In October 2017, its remit was expanded to include breast flattening and child abuse linked to faith or belief.The closure threat is revealed after evidence of an explosion in cases of forced marriage and honour-based abuse during the lockdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Karma Nirvana, a group training the police, NHS and social services, reported a 200 per cent surge in helpline calls in March and April.A government spokesperson said funding for the centre was “time-limited while we worked on more permanent solution to tackle this terrible practice”.“We have also introduced tough safeguarding laws to compel certain professionals to report if they have encountered cases of FGM in under 18s, provided funding for charities to support victims of FGM and, through our new relationships, health and sex education curriculum, we are teaching pupils about the emotional and physical damage of FGM in an age-appropriate way, as well as teaching that it is a crime,” the spokesperson said.Department for Education\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.7 great summer days out for the familyThe team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Former IMF chief Christine Lagarde has praised female leaders around the world for their “stunning” response to the coronavirus pandemic, especially when compared to their male counterparts.Ms Lagarde, who now heads the European Central Bank, said the policies adopted by female heads of state were proactive and their communication style was clear.“I would say that for myself I’ve learned that women tend to do a better job,” she said. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe added: “This is my woman’s bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias.”The top 10 worst affected countries are all led by men, both in terms of total number of cases and cases per million people.It is difficult to make a like-for-like comparison without considering factors like health expenditure, tourism and population density. There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders are risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The first day of Eid al-Adha marks the end of the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Makkah.Due to Islam traditionally using the lunar calendar the date does sht and its not officially on until theres a clear enough sky showing the crescent of a new moon.This means that there is also a day-long iation between countries depending on where they are in the world.In the UK Eid al-Adha  will begin on the evening of Thursday, July , and end on the evening of Monday, August .Eid usually starts with Muslims going to the Mosque for prayers in new finery.As the name would suggest, over the weekend there is usually the sacrice of a sheep, goat, camel or cow. The act is called Qurbani.In the period around Eid al-Adha, many Muslims travel to Mecca and the surrounding area in Saudi Arabia to perform the Hajj pilgrimage, which is one of the five pillars of Islam.It is a public holiday in traditionally or majority Muslim countries like Indonesia or the United Arab Emirates, but it isnt in more historically Christian countries like the UK.In the UK the animal is slaughtered in a slaughterhouse, but in other countries it is often done as part of a public ritual.It is a time that is spent visiting family and friends, usually involving a big meal and some partying. Kids often get presents too.The meat is shared equally between family, friends and the poor and unlike Eid al-Fitr, the meals made are predominantly savoury. It is a time when they visit family and friends. Muslims will also give money to charity so the less fortunate are also able to celebrate.There are two Eids, which makes things a bit confusing for those not brought up in Islam.Firstly, Eid means feast, so theyre both family gatherings and a good excuse for a party.Eid al-Fitr is celebrated at the end of Ramadan, this year in late May, to celebrate the end of fasting.Eid al-Fitr is often referred to as the sweet feast as Muslims will tend to put a greater emphasis on puddings. Eid al-Adha is the one thats coming up at the end of July and is the holier of the two feasts.It coincides with the end of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and is around two months after Eid al-Fitr.It is deemed the savoury or salty feast as there is a surplus of meat from the sacrice of the cattle that gets shared around everyone.Eid al-Adha sees the sacrices made as a symbolic act to mimic the near-sacrice of Ibrahimwho agreed to sacrice his son Ishmael when Allah God asked him to in repeated dreams.Ibrahim leads Ishmael to Mount Arafat, tied up his son and stuck a blindfold on so he wouldnt have to watch him suffer. The story goes that Allah replaced Ibrahim with a sheep as Ibrahim blindly flung the kne at his son. Other iations include an angel stepping in at the last moment and giving him a sheep or goat.This is the same story from the Old Testament of Abraham and Isaac.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You must vote Leave in that referendum.”I said to him: “Excuse me, sorry for asking, but are you a Russian ”He looked aghast and said: “Nyet! Why would you think that ”And I said: “Because you speak funny, you have borscht on your tie and you’re glowing, in a radioactive manner, slightly.”He went off around the pub saying the same thing to everyone . Later, I saw him with a bottle of vodka in one hand doing that dance where you crouch down and kick your legs out and shout “ha!” every so often. I wandered up. “Are you SURE you’re not a Russian ”There’s vodka dribbling down his chin and he smells of piroshki dumplings and isotopes. “Nyet! I am Englyishman. My name is Jyohn Smeeth.Definitely not Russian, definitely not KGB, my frent.”“Oh, OK,” I said, “No worries, good night.”“Dosvedanya, toich,” he replied.OK, that didn’t quite happen. But the remainers have got it into their heads that something like it did. We all voted Leave because the Russians interfered in our referendum. Meddled with our democratic process. Which is why we should stop leaving and have another vote.The allegation is that the Russkies tried to persuade us to vote leave by spreading  news around.What  news was that  That the European Union is an authoritarian bureaucracy run by pygmies from Luxembourg  That the EU wanted ever-closer political control over our country That we spent enormous sums of money keeping gibbering oafs like Jean Claude Juncker in office, while subsidising the useless states of Europe I don’t knowspecial agents Ivan and Dmitri were putting that stuff around, but I was well aware of the fact long beforethey were.Is there anything anyone can point to which suggests that the Russkies had an effect  There’s an allegation that they tried to ensure that the Scots voted for independence from the UK. And we should all vote for Jeremy Corbyn in the  election. Not hugely successful meddling operations, then, were they The thing about the alleged Brexit meddling is that it plays into the same narrative the remainers have been peddling for four years. We were all thick, us leavers. We voted Leave because we were DUPED. First by Boris and Nigel Farage. And now by the devilish Russians. Too dense to understand we were being conned, we voted Leave.Looking at the EU today, I’ve never been happier that we voted to get the hell out, incidentally.I have no doubt the Russians meddle in our affairs. I very much hope our own cyber spies are doing the same thing to them. I know the CIA is up to all sorts of tricks.Russia is not a very pleasant country right now and we should complain when it crosses the line — which it does, every month or so. But the idea that it had a decisive effect in our Brexit referendum is an insult to all those of us who thought long and hard and then voted Leave.The remainers can’t get over that we did so. They cannot bear to be defied. Tough. It wasn’t the Russians wot won it. It was us, the ordinary people of this fine country.And we’re still very glad we did.COVID has been good for some people. A lot of better- off people have been able to save loads of money, for example. And they don’t come much better off than the boss of Amazon, Jeff Bezos.Jeff has seen his income rise by a very agreeable £billion. That’s kind of enough money to buy France. So how about this, Jeffrey How about you get your company to pay the right amount of income tax in countries where you make so much money, such as the UK Last year Amazon did £billion worth of business in the UK – and paid £million in tax. That’s a tax rate, then, of two per cent.Not right, is it GOB on a very strange stick Janet Street Porter has been screeching about men. Again.She was having a go at Prince Andrew. Well, fair enough. The bloke is neither use nor ornament. And may soon be up to his neck in legal problems.I agree with the first part of what the toothy old harridan had to say. “Prince Andrew has no skills, no mates and no redeeming features.”Yup, largely agree, pet. But then she went on: “And so many modern middle-agedblokes are like that. That’s why women have drinks parties with their mates on Zoom, binge watch Netflix . . . and only laugh when they’re talking to gay men or their girlfriends.”She ended up by saying that men were becoming “redundant”.Can you imagine the outrageI had a go at a spectacularly useless woman – Janet Street Porter, for example.And then said most women were like her and that women in general are becoming redundant Ooh, there’d be howls of outrage.A LECTURER who said Jewish people had high intelligence has been sacked.Stephen Lamonby also said that Germans were good at engineering. For this – expelled. No job any more.Here’s the thing. Jewish people make up . per cent of the world’s population. And  per cent of Nobel Prize winners, like Bob Dylan, pictured.Countless studies have been done which show that Ashkenazi Jews have what one researcher, called, “the primo gene”. A high intellect. And Germans – well, they have been good at engineering, haven’t they Engineering Daily ranked countries in order of their prow-ess in the field. Germany came top. The magazine said: “Germany has long stood the test of time to emerge as a champion in the engineering field, reputed for its technical universities, internships and perhaps a culture and an economy that rewards engineering skills with both prestige and career growth.”Telling the truth, then, can now cost you your job. This moronic terror of the truth now infests most of our institutions. It has to stop.DAVID and Mary Sheldon took their newborn baby boy to the register office.And then got very upset. The registrar complained about their choice of name for the kid. Said it might cause him problems getting a job, later on.The Sheldons were very angry, but eventually got their way. The name they chose for their son  Lucer. Yep, that’s right, the Prince of Darkness. The parents said Lucer meant “bringer of light”.And while technically they might be right, it also means “that nasty, scaly, red b who lives in Hell”.A spokesman for Satan said yesterday: “I’m delighted by the Sheldons’ choice of name for their child. Lucer is a much maligned and misunderstood entity.“We will keep a close eye on the little mite and ensure that one day he rules the world, ha ha ha ha ha . . . ”I WAS sitting in a restaurant up here on Teesside. First meal out since lockdown. Large bloke comes in wearing a face mask. Uses the hand sanitiser by the door.Sits down, very carefully keeping his distance from everyone . He orders a double chicken parmo.For those of you not from Teesside, here’s what a parmo, pictured, is. A breast of chicken hammered flat. Then coated in bread- crumbs and deep fried. Then smothered in creamy bechamel sauce. And then with loads of Red Leicester on top of that.You eat it with chips and it’s , calories. He ordered a DOUBLE.You could almost hear his heart saying to him: “Look mate. Speaking on behalf of all of your bodily organs. We’d much rather you got Covid than ate that.“I think we can cope with Covid. But that thing is going to finish you off.”SPAIN has seen a big rise in Covid cases. Yup, amigo, it’s the dreaded “second spike” we’ve all been worried about.But people from the UK can still travel to Spain unhindered. And Spaniards can travel here without restriction.The Government says it will look at inidual countries and,need be, take them off the “air-bridge” list. Here’s my suggestion, Boris. Do it NOW.Quarantine for everyone arriving from Spain. Don’t make the same mistake you made in March. Back then there were NO restrictions on people from Covid hotspots – .million people arrived here up until lockdown.And that’s why we have one of the worst virus death rates in the world. Be quicker off the mark, Boris. Keep us safe.THE BBC will not rest until all the statues of Winston Churchill are torn down and his memory besmirched.Earlier this week the corporation broadcast a semi-literate tirade of abuse about Churchill’s “racism” and supposed brutality towards Indians.It was by a woman called Yogita Limaye. There was no discussion about the matter. Churchill was a racist, and that’s that. Also he caused the deaths of three million people in Bengal through a famine in .As it happens, the famine was caused by a tropical cyclone. These pieces were not “news” and so should not have been on The Ten O’Clock News. Andthey were to appear anywhere they should have been balanced.

But no one’s paying the slightest bit of attention.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesHand sanitiser  That’s what homeless people drink, isn’t it People roar up to me all the time, flinging their arms round my shoulders and asking for a selfie. And they look genuinely perplexed when I ask them politely to back up a bit.At the TV studios where I’m working, there’s a one-way system that’s not being used, electronic ­temper- ature checks that are covered in cobwebs and endless signs telling people to keep apart. Which no one can read because of the huddle they’re in.At breakfast in the hotel where I’m staying, no one’s wearing a mask and in the city’s restaurants it’s business as usual.The only slight change is that because so many are working from home, the girls have plenty of spare time to take off even more clothes than usual before going out.Face masks  Ha. You must be ­joking. They’re not wearing anything at all.The problem is that social distancing simply doesn’t work in the North, where people are naturally friendly. Asking a Manc to scuttle about with his head down and his eyes locked in the straight-ahead position is like asking a fish to tap-dance.They’re also a pretty sensible bunch. Did you know thatsomeone had the virus in March, and was killed last week by falling out of a tree, they are still chalked up as a “Covid death”  Well they do up here. They know that this pandemic is a wave that’s passed.In London and the South East, meanwhile, it’s a very dferent story. There are Covid Nazis at every turn, telling people to keep apart and everyone is happy to oblige.Face masks are everywhere and no one is punctual for their Zoom calls because they’ve just spent two hours washing their hands.There’s a simple reason for this. In London, no one has ever wanted to talk to their neighbour and now they have an excuse.The reaction to Covid is almost tailor-made for the capital. Because all the guidelines are basically giving people permission to do what they’ve always done.“What  No one is allowed to sit next to me on the Tube  Excellent.”On balance, I’ve got to say, I ­prefer it in Manchester.LAST autumn was the wettest for  years. The spring was the hottest and driest ever. And July is on course to be the coldest for  years.It seems that every single day a new weather record is broken, which suggests the climate is changing.Which makes me wonder. Why did no one see this coming Andthey did, why were they so quiet about it Yes, and now he’s the Democratic candidate in this year’s presidential elections.HAVING done Covid- vaccine tests on , ­volunteers, a team of ­British boffins in Oxford has announced that the initial results are “encouraging”.That’s pathetic. “Encouraging” is completely the wrong word. It’s what teachers write on a fat kid’s school report after he’s managed to come second to last in the  metres sack race.The fact is that Oxford is in a fight to develop this vaccine with an American biotech company, and you can be certain Hank won’t ever describe his progress as “encouraging”.He’s already said it’s “robust” and soon he’ll be saying his medicine “kicks ass” and that it’s “hammer time”. Evenit’s causing people’s penises to fall off.The British have always been good at understatement. I once saw survivors being interviewed after a tornado had ripped the heart out of a small town in Oklahoma in the US.The Americans were hysterical, sobbing and saying: “The wind speed was, like, , miles an hour and I saw God himself reach down and take our house.”Whereas a British man, visiting on business, said when the cameras were poked in his face that it had been “a trle breezy”.That was charming, but whoever develops a vaccine will bring billions into the country, so we don’t want charm. We want our scientists to develop an American gung-ho, up-and-at-’em attitude.They can start by dropping this “encouraging” nonsense and describing their results as “awesome”.This seemed odd, because fitting windows to a submarine is as daft as fitting a coffee machine to a duck.I therefore did some checking and it turns out they’re there so that when the sub is on the surface, the crew don’t have to go outside to see where they are going. Which means they won’t get cold.Diddums. And we thought these guys were tough.I’VE often wonderedit’s ­possible to put something into Google search engine and get no results at all.I’ve tried quite often with phrases like “Piers Morgan fans” or “Alicia Vikander ugly tree”.But I’ve never managed it.Well, this week I needed to attach a snow plough to the front of my tractor – don’t ask – and had no idea how it could be done.So I googled “Front linkage Lamborghini .R”.And there it was. “Your search did not match any ­documents”.WE learned this week that there’s been a  per cent surge in the sales of cassette tapes.Couple of points on that. First of all, why  The sound quality on a cassette is so bad that for many years I thought that the Bee Gees had done a song called Bald Headed Woman, that the Police had sung about Sue Lawley and that Desmond Dekker had been saying: “My ears are alight.”Point number two is: what happened to the massive collection of cassettes we all used to have in the Seventies They can’t all have ended up wrapped round single shoes on the motorway’s central reservation.That’ll give me something to do tonight, I guess.

It’s a call to action, a national effort that we need.“I’ve thought for a long time that keeping people healthy is the best way to keep them out of hospital. Covid has doubled down on that.“After your age and sex, the third biggest impact on whether you will dieyou catch Covid is obesity.“It’s the third-biggest impact on how hard it hits you.“So I’ve long believed the NHS isn’t just about fixing people when they’re ill. It’s about helping people when they’re healthy.“It’s the National Health Service, not the National Hospital Service. Tackling obesity is the No health issue after Covid.“But it’s linked to Covid too as it shows how dangerous obesity is. This package is all about protecting themselves and protecting the NHS.”Both Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Mr Hancock fell victim to coronavirus as they drew up the battle plan — with their decisions subject to a future inquiry.The PM, who has just turned , has since reportedly told colleagues, “Do not be a fatty in your fties” as he takes personal charge to defeat obesity and also acknowledging that his weight hampered him.BoJo spent three nights in intensive care and has lost more than a stone, having previously hit st.Mr Hancock, who helped beat the virus after getting fit during the election campaign, adds: “Obesity is one of the biggest long-term health challenges the country faces.“Covid has shone a spotlight on ill health and Covid has shone a spotlight on the importance of tackling obesity. We have got the biggest package of support for tackling obesity in history.“My experience of Covid is that I bounced back. But so many people didn’t. You just have to look at the figures to see the link.“I got quite fit during the general election campaign and I lost some weight. I’m just so glad that I did, because it helped.”As part of the drive, the TV industry faces restrictions on showing junk food ads before pm and there are plans to constrain such promotions online.Supermarket buy-one-get-one-free deals also face new rules and calorie counts on restaurant and takeaway- chain menus will come into force.Mr Hancock, who is often tempted by his daughter’s lemon meringue pie, is adamant the whole country has to show discipline on losing weight just like it obeyed lockdown measures.He says: “There is a huge role for parents to look out for the health of their children. We want to support parents to do that.“You wouldn’t give your child a cigarette. Parents have a responsibility that they eat healthily too.”“Teachers have a big role to play as well in this national effort. I applaud the Daily Mile [for young children to jog or run for  minutes daily at school] and there are lots of ways to exercise.”Offices and firms across the land are also being asked to buy into the new push.He says: “For all employers, for companies and bosses, Covid has shown health impacts on the bottom line. It’s in bosses’ interests to help their employees stay fit.”Doctors will also have a greater role to play in being more frank with patientsthey are obese or overweight.Patients will be referred to weight-loss services and told to head out walking and cycling as part of the new drive.Diners will be able to benefit from Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s Eat Out To Help Out from next Saturday.Askedan anti-obesity drive and starting the promotion is the best idea, Mr Hancock says, dryly: “Eat healthily to help out.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has previously had to keep tight-lipped over his views due to BBC impartiality rules, but is free to speak his mind after stepping down last year. During an interview with Times Radio, he was asked whether he had voted for the current PM last December. “No, I didn’t vote for Johnson,” he said. “I’ve not been a fan of Johnson... I can say that now, I couldn’t say that a year ago, could I  “I don’t trust him. Apart from anything , I don’t trust him and you have to be able to trust politicians.” The journalist, , claimed the PM was not “too good” at delivering on his promises. He said: “There’s a lovely old Welsh expression, I’m not allowed to use it because this is public broadcasting, but he’s full of something something and wind. He’s great at the bluster bit but he’s not too good when it comes to delivering.”  The Mastermind presenter said he could not see that the Conservative Party leader had “gained” from his upbringing and private school education. “His background is, for somebody like me... a working class boy and all that, anathema,” he added. “You know, he had all the benefits, all the advantages of going to the finest school in the world,that’s what Eton really is... and a wonderful university, all the rest of it.

Firstly, Keir Starmer askedJohnson had a message for people whose relatives had suffered from coronavirus – and he replied that Starmer had “more briefs than Calvin Klein”. It’s not only hilarious, but I’m sure it comforted grieving relatives. Then he responded to Starmer’s questions about the delayed report on Russian interference with our elections, by saying Starmer had “more flip-flops than Bournemouth beach”. Another glorious joke and one that certainly puts all our minds at ease about Vladimir Putin. So here are some others he can try, about himself. If he’s asked how much protective equipment his government provided for medical staff during the pandemic, he can say “We gave them less protection than a chemist’s at the Vatican”. If he’s asked what happened to the track and tracing he promised would “lead the world”, he can say “It’s had more failed dates than the history of Tinder”. He can tell us “Dominic Cummings has more implausible stories than Hollyoaks” and “his eyesight needs more checks than a chess tournament”. He can say “I consumed more coke than Sheffield steelworks” and I have “more kids I’ve forgotten about than an amnesiac goat herder”. Everyone seems to agree he’s a great speaker, witty and able to communicate clearly in a language we all understand. For example, there was the inspiring speech he gave to the West Yorkshire Police that began: “Everyone’s learning the caution, you know the caution, you know what you have to say, you do not have to say anything. “Is that right  Anything you butyou fail to mention something, which you later, hang on, is that right ” What is so reassuring about a speech like that is we’re all thinking it, but he’s the only one capable of putting it into words. It’s also a measure of his kindness that when he speaks he also give us a free puzzle, in which we have to try to put the words into an order that makes an actual sentence. Sometimes he explains ideas with even more clarity by throwing in a chunk of Latin, and some think “that means he MUST be clever”. We should extend this to everyone. If someone working class says “I tell you what, right, here, listen, you know that wotnot, well ipso facto modus operandi I tell you that for nuffink”, we should all say “what a splendid educated fellow he must be”.

And the Health Secretary added that without them, the health service would die.Boris Johnson singled out the two nurses who tended him – when his own le hung in the balance as he was racked by Covid- – for their dedication, skill and overwhelmingkindness.The PM also rightly recognised that they were typical of the hundreds of thousands of others putting their own lives at risk to save others. Yet in the public sector pay round last week, Mr Hancock and Mr Johnson left nurses out. They have every right to feel hurt, undervalued – and bloody furious.  So much so that, as the Sunday Mirror reveals today, , of them are now considering quitting.  That would be both a tragedy and a disaster. It is true that nurses, along with other NHS workers, agreed a three-year pay deal which does not run out until next March. In normal times, they would have stuck to their side of the bargain and not expected a rise until then. But these are not normal times. These are the most extraordinary times the NHS has been through since its  foundation.  Hospital staff have performed superhuman feats to care for the sick and dying, and hundreds have died themselves doing it. We clapped for them because it was the only way under lockdown we could express our immense and heartfelt gratitude. Mr Johnson verbally patted them on the back. Now he has slapped them in the face. Just as the coronavirus has changed all our lives, it should also change how we reward those who have given their all. That means starting pay negotiations now to ensure a hefty rise is in wage packets by Christmas. This is not the most you can do for them, Mr Johnson. It is the least. Act of comfort  The argument in favour of a Child Burial Fund to help parents hold funerals for their most precious loved ones was unassailable. Labour’s Carolyn Harris made it time and again in the Commons. The Sunday Mirror campaigned alongside her. And behind the scenes so did most MPs, including Theresa May when she was PM. Only the stone-hearted scrooges in the Treasury stood in the way. A year ago the argument was finally won and the Treasury coughed up the cash.

Here, in his own words, he shares his story... Have you ever sat on the bus and seen someone making a strange noise  Perhaps you moved away, feeling uncomfortable. Well, that person was possibly someone like me. I have Tourette’s Syndrome . Which means sometimes I make weird noises and twitch. Sometimes this freaks people out. You might assume all people with Tourette’s shout out swear words. But actually coprolalia – as it’s known – affects only % of us. I like to swear as much as the next Yorkshireman, but I don’t do it uncontrollably as part of my Tourette’s. There are many misconceptions about this neurological condition. My tics began when I was seven. I would snf loudly or let out a kind of ‘whooping’ noise. With little awareness on the topic, my parents had no clue what it could be. It took a primary school teacher to gently suggest I might have Tourette’s after watching a documentary. My mum, Annette, did her research after that, and within a few weeks we travelled from our home in Bradford to London’s Great Ormond Street, where the hospital confirmed the diagnosis. There is no cure for Tourette’s, but treatment can help manage symptoms. I was put on medication to help calm the tics. It didn’t work, but it made me pile on the pounds. So now I had my weight as well as tics to feel self-conscious about. I had no real understanding of what was happening, but that year I wrote to Father Christmas begging him to make me ‘normal’. People often ask what the tics feel like. Sometimes they are conscious, sometimes they aren’t. For the ones that are, it’s like an urge to scratch a bad mosquito bite – the more you resist the itch, the bigger it becomes. But when you finally scratch, after a moment of relief, the sensation s.  A tic can be anything from a noise, twitch or cough, to rapid head movements, finger clicks, deep breaths and whistles. It gets worse when you’re stressed, sick, nervous or excited, and everyone’s dferent. In public, during a bad day, it’s often mortying. I remember one of the visits to London when I was eight. Feeling excited about the train, the tics were prominent. I let out some ‘whoops’ and a man in the carriage shouted, ‘Will someone please shut that child up!’ My mum was furious on my behalf, but I felt such shame. It’s for this reason so many kids with Tourette’s shut themselves away. I was bullied, with name calling including ‘spastic’, ‘retard’ and ‘abortion’. Kids can be a***holes, and sometimes the teachers were unwittingly as bad. I got sent out of class when my vocal tics were aggravated. Standing in the hallway felt like a punishment for something I couldn’t help. And there was the supply teacher who yelled, ‘What on earth is wrong with you, boy ’ in front of the whole class. Even when people tried to be kind, hurtful situations arose. When our neighbours held a birthday party for their son, I’d been allowed early access on the bouncy castle. But when the guests arrived I was told it was ‘just for adults’ now and sent home. The next few hours were spent in my bedroom, tears rolling, as I listened to kids bouncing with glee. They were embarrassed about the twitching kid who makes noises. I hated being dferent.  So many kids with TS are full of self-loathing. I feel it’s my duty to help educate the next generation. There needs to be more compassion and understanding, so children aren’t scared and so judged. And while this may seem like a sorrowful tale, it’s actually not. Thankfully, le slowly improved. At senior school, aged , I had asked the headmaster to announce in assembly I had TS and explain what it was. This actually helped kids and staff become more tolerant. I learned an important lesson in facing problems head-on. While I wasn’t popular, I did have some friends. I was around  when I realised that channelling my energy into my passions – writing, drama, entrepreneurial projects – saw my tics begin to slow down and even disappear in some cases. These became coping mechanisms, greatly reducing the urges to tic. Truth is, people with Tourette’s have a superpower that, when channelled into something they love, makes them unstoppable. Intertwine this with ious cognitive behavioural therapies , such as meditation and positive mental attitude techniques, and it sets us a world apart. At  I landed a place at Lancaster University, studying marketing management, which I loved. I also ‘came out’. I’d had crushes on boys since I was , so this was a massive relief.  I first became interested in wine when, during my course, I spent a year in San Francisco. I met an amazing couple who became like family to me, Steve and Rose Smith. I’d often shadow them on weekends at their winery, and their love for wine completely rubbed off on me – the senses, the smells, the tasting profiles. I was hooked, and it kick-started my career in the wine industry. I now write a wine and spirits column, and through this world met my incredible friends Helena Nicklin and Colin Hampden-White. Together, we created an award-winning TV series on Amazon Prime called The Three Drinkers. You might wonder how the hell a person with Tourette’s ended up as a TV presenter  Interestingly, when the cameras roll, I’m so focused on doing what I love, my tics go away and viewers have no idea. Tourette’s doesn’t just ‘disappear’, of course. It’s with us forever, although statistically it calms down with age. Confidence issues can greatly affect people with TS. Take dating. ‘Will anyone ever fall in love with me ’ is a concern that worries many of us. On a first date my tics can go unnoticed, some of us learn to mask them. But by the time someone comes over for dinner they get more obvious. People ask, ‘Have you got hiccups ’ and you have to work out when best to tell them. I don’t exactly want to pull out the TS leaflets over the second bottle of wine. I’m still navigating this. My le will never be ‘normal’, and I’ll continue getting odd looks. But I’m happy and successful. These days I see having Tourette’s not as my weakness, but my biggest strength.  Touretteaposs – the facts WHAT IS TOURETTE’S  A neurological condition characterised by repetitive, stereotyped, involuntary movements and vocalisations called tics.

Now, when I hear a new dog is coming into my le I can barely sleep. I am so excited. What will they look like  How will their personality be  What challenges will I need to help them overcome  I’ve always been a dog lover, but was never allowed one when I was growing up in Essex. Then in my late teens, I met a guy who did not like dogs – our relationship lasted  years, so getting a four-legged friend had not been an option. When he and I eventually split in , he moved out of our Gloucestershire cottage, and I thought, ‘Sod it! I’ve only myself to please now.’  It was back in September, soon after the break-up, when I contacted the Dogs Trust and applied to be a foster carer. As a single woman I couldn’t afford to buy a dog, and the beauty of volunteering to foster means that the charity covers the cost of food and anything  you need to buy for the dog while in your care, including any vet bills. Interview stage There were interviews, home visits and paperwork – I passed all the requirements. As a gardener, I can take a dog with me to work most days, so it wouldn’t be left alone, plus I have a garden and live near the Forest of Dean, perfect for walking. And I don’t have children or any other pets to worry about, so I was seen as a good option. From a selfish point of view, I was looking forward to sharing my empty home with someone  again. Another warm body on the sofa next to me.  It was in March, just as coronavirus was sweeping the nation, when Dogs Trust Evesham rang. They had a nine-month-old Collie cross-breed who’d been rescued from dire conditions where  dogs had been kept in a barn. Could I take her in until they found her a permanent home  Melted my heart Well, they brought Athena to my garden and my heart just melted at the first sight of her pretty face. She wasn’t used to human contact, so I didn’t make a huge fuss. I let her snf around my garden as I drank a cup of tea, just watching her. By that first evening she was laying her head in my lap. I had to toilet train her, which involved heaps of praise when she went outside. If she had accidents inside I never told her off, I just quickly cleaned it up. I got through plenty of cleaning products, but after a week she’d got the hang of it. As I busily worked in clients’ gardens, I listened to audiobooks on dog behaviours and training to educate myself. Athena stayed for three and a half weeks before it was time for her to leave to be with her permanent owner. I cried when she left, but felt so happy that I’d been able to help her. Being toilet trained makes a dog far more appealing to adoptees.  Aries came next, a two-year-old cross-breed. He hated the noise of the bin men, all the crashing around and the flashing lights, but quickly learned to walk on the lead. I began chatting to new people on our walks. Having a dog gave my le structure, some company, and – I know this sounds silly – but I felt myself healing after the split, I got healthier and stronger. I would have felt so isolated in lockdown otherwise. How long you have a dog totally depends on how soon they are re-homed, so it can be anything from a few days to several weeks. Joy and fulfilment I really fell in love with Hermes, my next dog. He was also from the same barn, and terried of everything. He freaked out indoors and would scrabble to escape out of a window, then whimper. I would stand outside and keep an eye on him from the window, gradually building up the time he could be left. It was a complete buzz seeing his behaviour change. It was hard kissing Hermes goodbye, he’d become my buddy, but I know my time with him had changed his le prospects. My fourth dog was an adorable, problem-free Maltese puppy, Bea. I’ve never had one try to bite me. The most damage they’ve caused is chewing a wooden coffee table leg, but I am not precious about these things.  I’m having a few days away now, but I can’t wait to welcome a new dog into my le when I’m back. I bumped into my ex the other day and he remarked how happy I seemed now. Who knows, maybe one day I’ll be out walking and meet someone new  But I’m happy being single now, the dogs have brought me more joy and fulfilment than I thought possible. What is dog fostering  ● The Home From Home fostering scheme finds temporary homes for dogs that need a little extra TLC, such as young puppies, older dogs and those who would find the hustle and bustle of kennels stressful. ● Fostering is completely voluntary, and Dogs Trust provides essentials, such as food and bedding, and provides -hour guidance and training advice. ● Adam Clowes, Dogs Trust operations director, says: ‘Being a foster carer gives you all the joy of adopting without the long-term commitment. It’s perfect for dog lovers who aren’t ready to adopt yet. aposJust as importantly, becoming a foster carer means helping fellow dog lovers who have no other choice than to permanently give up their dog. You’ll be giving a dog a loving home when they need it most. Every dog in foster care allows us to take in another dog in need.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"anne diamond winter preparedness covid","story":"NewsopinionAnne Diamond: Winter preparedness in a Covid- year is going to take on a whole new urgencyAs scientists fear second wave of pandemic, planned measures to help NHS cope include  million extra people being offered free flu jab.

According to Finding Freedom, the couple were dismayed when no picture of them and their son Archie was visible on the desk in the Green Drawing Room at Buckingham Palace, where the Queen records her annual speech. In , Harry and Meghan appeared in a photo with William and Kate as the Queen read her Christmas message. Authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand write that Harry and Meghan felt they had long been sidelined by the institution and were not a fundamental part of its future. The absence of their photo was yet another sign that they needed to consider their own path, the book says. According to palace sources quoted in the book, the Royal Family wanted to illustrate the line of succession. Harry and Meghan were not completely disregarded in the Christmas Day speech, however. Footage of the Queen and Prince Philip meeting Archie for the first time was included, with footage showing Harry, Meghan and Meghan’s mum, Doria Ragland, watching on. I have been delighted to welcome our eighth great-grandchild, the Queen said at the time.  In the Queenaposs  Christmas Day speech, Her Majesty can be seen sitting in the Green Drawing Room of the palace beside a table with framed pictures. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall appear in a photo which marked the th anniversary of his investiture as Prince of Wales. A lovely family portrait of William, Kate, George, Charlotte and Louis stands in the middle. Thereaposs also a photograph of King George VI from  as well as one of the Duke of Edinburgh from the Queenaposs private collection. But notably, Harry, Meghan and their son Archie are no where to be seen. Royal commentator Ingrid Seward said at the time it was unlikely the Queen’s photo selections represented a deliberate snub to Harry and Meghan. But she said: “It does seem to represent the idea of a slimmed-down monarchy.” Ms Seward added: “All the media problems with Harry and Meghan must have worried her. However, she would never be so underhand as to deliberately omit their picture.” Prince Andrew, forced to quit royal duties over his aposcar crashapos Newsnight interview over his ­friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, was also absent from the photos.As the Queenaposs Christmas Day speech was aired to millions across the world, Meghan and Harry were spending the Christmas break in Canada with their young son."},{"url":null,"title":"hundreds revellers ignore coronavirus restrictions","story":"NewsHundreds of revellers ignore coronavirus restrictions to party in the streetNeighbours in Cheylesmore, Coventry, claim that up to  people partied at the illegal street event where some smoked cannabis while they enjoyed loud rap musicShareCommentsByJosh LaytonLorraine King:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video coronavirus-uk-confirmed-deaths--,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The Earl of Snowdon, widely known by his professional name David Linley, was in the paedophile’s list of contacts. Others included some of the world’s most powerful people, including Donald Trump and former US president Bill Clinton. Florida-based Spencer Kuvin, representing several Epstein victims, urged the royal to speak to investigators, alongside his cousin Prince Andrew. There is no suggestion the Earl is accused of any wrongdoing or has any information about Prince Andrew’s friendship with Epstein, who died in jail in , or his socialite pal Ghislaine Maxwell.But Mr Kuvin told the Sunday People: “Anyone with information about Epstein, Maxwell and any of their comings and goings over the past two decades and more should come forward and talk, including Viscount Linley. He added: “I am never surprised at the growing list of people that became Epstein’s unfortunate friends. He worked his way into every part of society, high and low.”  The Earl is known as the royal carpenter due to his high-end furniture business Linley’s. His mother Margaret, the Queen’s sister, died in  and he became the nd Earl of Snowdon after his father died in . The Earl, now set to orce after more than  years of marriage, was picked by his first cousin Prince Charles as No in The Prince’s Foundation. The appointment in  raised eyebrows as he was chosen ahead of William and Harry. A friend said: “David is very, very close to the Queen and Prince Charles. He goes to Sandringham at Christmas and Balmoral in the summer. He is George VI’s grandson and in the inner circle of royals. He is also Mr Non-Grand Royal. He turns up on his cycle in a high-vis jacket and gets mistaken for a warden. He is popular and social.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton rolled out red","story":"NewsKate Middleton rolled out the red carpet for Meghan as friends hit out at bookFriends of the Duchess of Cambridge have struck back at fresh claims in new biography Finding Freedom, that say the royal was unwelcoming towards MeghanShareCommentsByLila Randall:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsMeghan and Kate at Wimbledon last year \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

But friends have hit back at the negative comments, saying Kate aposwelcomed Meghan with open armsapos with a number of gestures to make their future in-law feel at home. The Cambridges hosted at their private home Anmer Hall in Norfolk where she cooked Meghan her favourite vegan dish.

At the very least, the co-authors, Carolyn Durand and Omid Scobie, who has been accused of being Meghanaposs mouthpiece, had access to close friends of the Sussexes. The book defends Meghan and Harry and reveals what was behind their decision to quit their roles as senior royals and pursue their own projects in private le. It describes a culture of increasing tension between the couple and other senior royals. Meghan, Harry and one-year-old son Archie are now living in pal Tyler Perryaposs £ million Tuscan-style mansion in Los Angeles after breaking out on their own. Here are some of the bombshell claims revealed in the second extracts of the book. Williams two words about Meghan aposthat caused rt with Harryapos William feared his brother had been blindsided by lust in his haste to wed Meghan - and used two words in particular that angered Harry, the book claims. The co-authors claim the Duke of Sussex was angered by what he perceived as his brotheraposs snobbish attitude to his bride. Harry was offended by Williamaposs unwanted advice to take as much time as you need to get to know this girl, it is alleged. According to the book, William was happy for his brother, but just wanted to make sure that Harry wasnapost blindsided by lust. But his younger brother allegedly took offence to the phrase this girl, and interpreted it as snobbish and condescending. aposRt stemmed from coolness between princesapos  According to the co-authors, the alleged rt between the two couples stemmed from a growing coolness between Harry and William - and not Meghan and Kate. The press were apparently too quick to blame the Sussexesapos decision to move to Windsor on the duelling duchesses, the authors say, when it was Harry who felt suffocated by his brother. Meghan and Kate aposwere not at warapos As it became clear there were problems between the Cambridges and Sussexes, some press reports claimed Meghan and Kate were at odds or even disliked each other. But the biography claims the pair were not at war, but did have their awkward moments and never became close because they had nothing in common. It alleges the Duchess of Cambridge apparently did little to bridge the ide between William and Harry, and never really got to know Meghan. The authors claim Meghan and Kate didnapost spend much time together before the Sussexes got married in May  and they didnapost get any closer afterwards. aposAwkward momentsapos between duchesses  There were some awkward moments between the royal wives, but the duo never had a falling out. It is claimed Meghan had hoped Kate would reach out to her, but didnapost lose sleep over it when she did not. The book says: Meghan would agree with the assessment that the duchesses were not the best of friends. Their relationship hadnapost progressed much since she was Harryaposs girlfriend. But they were not at war with each other, either. There were awkward moments, such as the day the women happened to cross paths at Kensington Palace , and although both were heading out to go shopping - in the same street - Kate went in her own Range Rover. Meghan didnapost make Kate cry, book claims Rumours that Meghan made Kate cry during a bridesmaidaposs dress fitting for Princess Charlotte are , the book insists. Reports that Meghanaposs strict demands had left Kate in tears puzzled those who were present. A source who was there claimed: Some of the children werenapost co-operating, and there was a lot going on. Everyone tried to help where they could, but itaposs never easy with kids at fittings. There were no tears from anyone. And in the end, the fitting was fine. Kate and Meghan were both a little stressed but professional in the room, and there were other people there. Harryaposs aposshowgirlapos  Finding Freedom claims some senior royals, courtiers and aides had ious names for Meghan behind her back. One senior royal allegedly referred to the duchess as Harryaposs showgirl - and another said she comes with a lot of baggage. Another senior courtier is said to have told a colleague: Thereaposs just something about her I donapost trust. Sussexes aposfelt snubbedapos by Queen Harry and Meghan are said to have felt snubbed when the Queen delivered her Christmas Day speech last year and they didnapost see photos of their family next to her. The absence of their photo was yet another sign that they needed to consider their own path, the book says. However, the Queen mentioned Archieaposs birth in her speech and the broadcast showed footage of her and Prince Philip meeting their eighth great-grandchild for the first time. Meghan felt sorry for her dad - and then let down The Duchess of Sussex felt sorry for her estranged father Thomas, wanted him at her wedding and blamed the media for corrupting him, according to the book. She felt let down when Mr Markle lied to her by denying he helped the paparazzi stage photos of him going about his le in a Mexican resort town before his daughteraposs wedding. But both Meghan and Harry were also angry at the media for allegedly wearing down Mr Markle for several months until he complied with their requests. According to an unnamed trusted confidant of the duchess, Meghan had said: My dad never sought this out. I really believe that heaposs the victim, and now I feel sad because I believe heaposs been fully corrupted. Meghanaposs dad and half-sister apossplit cash from staged photosapos The book says after a newspaper revealed the location of his home in November, , Mr Markle rejected constant media requests with a line prepared for him by royal officials of: I canapost speak out of respect for my family. Meghan and Harry told him to do his best to ignore the press, but ultimately - with encouragement from Meghanaposs elder half-sister Samantha - Mr Markle accepted a proposal from photographer Jeff Rayner, the book says. Mr Markle agreed to participate in several set-up photos, including one of him reading a book on British history while at a cafe. The photos were published around the world, with Mr Rayner earning £,, and Mr Markle and daughter Samantha sharing % of the proceeds, according to the book. A week before the May  royal wedding, Kensington Palace officials heard a Sunday tabloid was planning to expose the photo-shoot as having been staged. Meghan called dad to find out truth  The book says palace communications staff and lawyers were moving to have publication stopped, as Meghan phoned her father. Dad, we need to knowthis is true or not, because my team is going to try and stop this story from running -you are telling me itaposs fake, she reportedly told him. If they do that, theyaposre going out of their way to protect you, Dad. Youaposre telling me youaposre being victimised, right  Mr Markle had replied Of course, failing to admit he had participated in the staging of the photos, which were duly exposed as set-ups in the press the next day. Duchess still wanted her dad at wedding Despite his deception, Meghan had still wanted her father at her wedding. He ultimately did not attend, partly due to suffering a heart attack days before the event, which he blamed on the stresses of pressure from the media. As much as she was hurt and humiliated, she wanted him to be there and was willing to move on, an unidentied friend of Meghanaposs is quoted as saying. Plus, she was worried about him she honestly wasnapost surehe was actually OK. His behaviour was bizarre. Thomas ignored Meghanaposs last text before wedding  The book gives further glimpses of Meghanaposs troubled relationship with Mr Markle, including a string of uned phone messages and texts from the former actress to her father in the days before her wedding. She allegedly left or sent dozens of messages telling him a car would take him to Los Angeles airport so he could fly to London. He was expected to walk her down the aisle. After he had told her he wouldnapost be there to watch her get married, the biography claims, a heartbroken Meghan sent her dad one final text message the night before her wedding.

Meghan is said to have thought some of the stories about her were down to her sex and because she has a black mum. Extracts from new biography Finding Freedom, by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, claim a friend said that she was seen as ‘Duchess Dferent’ and because she stood out she was not liked by some. The controversial book is serialised by the Sunday Times. The friend said: It was open season on Meghan, with many looking for anything and everything to criticise ‘“Duchess Dferent. “That’s what people have a problem with. She’s the easiest person in the world to work with. Certain people just don’t like the fact she stands out.”’ Meghan, a former actress, is claimed to have a solid work ethic which includes waking at am each morning and talking to her key aides about how to shape her new role in the royal family. However shortly after Harry and Meghan’s marriage in May  rumours emerged that she was wasting no time in putting her aposstampapos on her new role and those around her. The book claims this led to her decisive and assertive nature being seen negatively. The authors wrote: Meghan felt as though some of the commentary and tabloid stories were more than a culture clash they were sexist and prejudiced. If a man got up before dawn to work, he was applauded for his work ethic. If a woman did it, she was deemed dficult or “a bitch”. The double standard was exacerbated when it came to successful women of colour, often labelled demanding or aggressive.’ The authors said in the book that while racism ‘takes a dferent form in the UK from in America’, it remains ‘ingrained’ here. Mr Scobie, a royal journalist who has a Scottish dad and an Iranian mum, reportedly left his first job at Heat magazine after he was racially abused by an executive.It is claimed that a worker at Buckingham Palace once said he was ‘surprised’ to hear Mr Scobie, was was privately educated, speak so well. In their book, Mr Scobie and Ms Durand say: Racism takes a dferent form in the UK from in America, but there is no mistaking its existence and how ingrained it is. A major theme of racism in the UK centres on the question of who is authentically “British”.

Rachel Riley is one of the famous faces backing the awards, which will for the first time recognise the amazing work of iniduals from National Lottery-funded projects across the nation.  Rachel says: “Thanks to National Lot­­tery players, some £million has gone to support communities in the crisis. “But this year we want to honour the people within those projects who adapted so quickly and gave extra help. “It’s a real chance to say thank you. The winners in each category will win £, for their organisation and a National Lottery Award trophy.” Nominations are open- and the stories of some of the heroes already put forward showcase the commitment and sacrice so many people have been making during these troubled times.  Take actress and theatre director Moji Elufowoju, the founder of Sheffield-based Utopia Theatre Company. She has just been nominated for a National Lottery Award, thanks to the incredible Creative Hub initiative she has been running during lockdown. Now , Moji swapped a career as a paralegal to study drama in her forties before founding Utopia Theatre in . And as a British-born, Nigerian-raised performer, Moji says she had to battle discrimination in an industry where ethnic minorities have struggled for opportunities. She broke through after “continually banging my head against a brick wall and refusing to take no for an answer”. She is now determined to inspire a new generation of black artists.  “There’s a white middle-class club in British theatre and it can make the industry inaccessible to others – whether that’s performing, playwriting or simply being in the audience,” says Moji. “You can feel invisible, and I know a lot of black creatives with mental health issues as a result. “Utopia Theatre is all about giving erse people a voice. We showcase African culture and traditions, through classic plays and new material.” Last month, Utopia Theatre launched the Creative Hub, a free six-month programme of virtual workshops to combat the devastating effects of lockdown on the profession.

Social media exploded will fans pointing out his uncanny resemblance to uncle James Middleton, with a photo unearthed of Kateaposs brother, now , from .

It is in keeping with the relaxed and informal feel of the photos, which also see the prince with ruffled hair and in the outdoors - testament to his mumaposs laid-back style of parenting. During an interview for the  Happy Mum, Happy Baby  podcast back in February, Kate opened up about one very common parenting topic - mum guilt.

The animal, thought to be  to  weeks old, was seen hitting the road and rolling over a few times when, according to witnesses, it was thrown from a car driving towards Alsager just before pm.Another driver had to swerve to avoid hitting the female tabby kitten, pulled over to find it on the roadside with severe injuries, and rushed it to a nearby vet who then alerted the RSPCA for help, StokeonTrentLive reports.The RSPCA has released a photo of the injured kitten and an image of a dark blue car as part of its investigation. Inspector Caren Goodman-James said: “This is such a shocking incident. It is so upsetting to think anyone would consider doing this to an animal. “The car was on Audley Road just before the junction with Merelake Road and travelling towards Alsager from the A junction when Daisy was thrown out of the window. “The poor kitten was seen hitting the road and rolled over a few times before stopping. The witness in the car behind had to swerve to avoid hitting her and initially thought she was a piece of rubbish that had been thrown out of the car. It was only when the kitten moved her head up did they realise it was an animal and stopped their car to help. She added: “We are so grateful to the driver that stopped to help poor Daisy. This poor kitten was just thrown to the kerb like a piece of rubbish.  I have dealt with incidents of animals being dumped and abandoned before but this is extreme. It is very lucky that this little kitten survived. “The vet is hopeful that Daisy will pull through but the next  hours are crucial. Ms Goodman-James said the kitten has a pull injury to its tail, meaning it will need to be amputated. It also suffered a lower jaw fracture and head trauma.

The maps were kept by Royal Naval Lieutenant James Main, who was a navigating officer on HMS Fraserburgh, the leading ship of the minesweeping flotilla on June , . Lt Main, along with hundreds of comrades, helped clear the English Channel and the sea around Normandy of mines to enable the Allied forces to safely advance to the beaches. His ship occupied a position off Ouistreham on Sword Beach during Operation Neptune. His wartime possessions include the top secret navigation maps he would have used to help plot the route to Sword Beach. His archive also includes a wrecked German flag he recovered from off the beach after it had been taken by the Allies, and an Australian one which was lying on the sand. The archive is expected to fetch £, when it goes under the hammer with London-based Chiswick Auctions. One map, issued on May , , lists all naval headquarters and instructions on communications protocols. Another chart, headed ‘swept channels and routing situation D-Day’, shows routes from the English Channel to each landing beach. His other possessions in the sale are his leather scabbard, hat, belt, identity card and navigation instruments.Lt Main, a Distinguished Service Cross recipient, was born in Newcastle in  and enlisted with the Navy in , carrying on his service post-war. Valentina Borghi, specialist at Chiswick Auctions, said: “It is very rare to find top secret D-Day material and we expect interest from museums and institutions. “There are photos of Lt Main and also of coastal positions which aided the important landings as he cleared mines to clear the course to Sword beach, with his task beginning on June .“He was navigating officer on board HMS Fraserburgh, the leading ship of the minesweeping flotilla on D-Day. “Unfortunately not a lot is known about his post-war le but we believe he remained in the navy for a time. “The archive has been put together by a private collector.”Sword Beach, the most eastern of the five landing areas, was assaulted by the British rd Division, with French and British commandos attached. The initial landings were achieved with few casualties, but the advance from the beach was slowed by German resistance on the heavily defended beach head.

The moniker has gone viral on social media, being used to depict a passive-aggressive, judgmental woman who is rude, quick to complain, often racist – and usually white and middle-aged. It surged during Black Lives Matter protests, when videos were circulated of white women – labelled Karens – clashing with demonstrators. But angry Karens are now demanding “respect” in a series of online petitions. Karen Button, from Wallingford, Oxfordshire, said she has “had enough”. She said being associated with women “who are racist or not law abiding is upsetting and unfair”. Another Karen wrote: “We are not Medusa-like beings or fire-breathing dragons. And WE ARE DEFINITELY NOT RACIST!!” She added she is not privileged and does not have a bad hairdo – other traits mocked in internet memes.  A third Karen wrote: “My parents gave me this name out of love. I refuse to change it because of cruel people on the internet.” The name consistently ranked in the top  in England and Wales between  and . But it has lost popularity in recent years, with just  UK babies named Karen in . Harry Potter author JK Rowling was labelled “a Karen” after saying young gay people were being “shunted” towards hormones and transgender surgery. Some argue negative use of Karen is steeped in sexism, as it demonises opinionated and assertive women. Days before Jess Phillips was appointed Shadow Minister for Domestic Violence and Safeguarding, more than , people liked a tweet calling her Shadow Karen Minister. Some online posts refer to the Ku Klux Karen, linking the name to the white supremacy group.

The woman was booted off the American Airlines flight travelling from Ohio to North Carolina on July . Video footage taken by passenger Jordan Slade and shared on social media shows the moment the woman made her way off the plane. After the woman picked up her three bags and started to exit the aircraft, other passengers began to cheer and clap. The woman angrily turned around and shouted: You can clap all you want. A passenger responded by saying: Just leave. We have flights to get. Jesus.  All adult passengers travelling on American Airlines flights are required to wear a face covering due to the coronavirus pandmic.Ms Slade said the woman claimed she wasnapost wearing a mask because of a medical condition.The witness told the Daily Mail: She was argumentative from the gate. She demanded to be boarded first and was causing an obvious scene. Once boarded she was making phone calls and arguing with the attendant when asked to put her phone away. Ms Slade added: She also refused to wear a mask putting others on the flight at risk... Another passenger even got up to confront her about her behavior with no mask. A number of passengers reportedly spoke to flight attendants on the plane to voice concerns that they may miss their connecting flights. The incident took up so much time that after the woman was kicked off the flight the plane had to go back to the airport to refuel.    Ms Slade uploaded the video of passengers clapping and cheering the woman, branded a aposKarenapos, off the flight to Tik Tok, where it has been watched hundreds of thousands of times. Currently, more than , people have liked the video.  Clapping was % necessary, one person commented. Another said: The person beside her was literally wearing a mask and a face shield. If you canapost wear a mask on the plane then just drive wherever you need to go.The video was also shared on Twitter, where a number of users were quick to slam the woman.One said: Why the hell would someone pay for a flight and then forfeit their seat because they’re too stubborn to wear a mask  Why bother buying a ticket  How long was this flight  Surely it couldnapost be more than a few hours  Crazy. Another added: FANTASTIC! She had a choice - wear the mask or get off the plane - she made her choice to be selfish and self centered and not wear a mask for the safety of others on the plane - good riddance!  From July , American Airlines will require all customers over the age of two to wear face coverings on board planes and at airports. The company said passengers must keep their masks on from the time they enter their departure airport to the time they exit their arrival airport, except for while eating or drinking. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention one of the best ways we can slow the spread of Covid- is to wear a face covering, said Alison Taylor, chief customer officer of American Airlines.

For months officials in countries such as China, Japan and Hong Kong have been busy dousing public places in hypochlorous acid. The substance, which is known as HCIO, is formed by dissolving chlorine in water, and is dozens of times more effective at killing viruses than bleach. It is also incredibly cheap to produce. Despite having helpful cleansing properties, the acid is weak enough to pose little threat to humans and is used to keep swimming pool water clean. Earlier this week the UK government approved trials which will see HCIO sprayed in public places. The fact the use of the liquid has taken so long to be used in the UK, when its effectiveness where has been apparent for months, has been questioned by experts. Dr Darren Reynolds, professor in Health and Environment at the University of the West of England, told MailOnline: We should have used HOCl from the very start. It would have made a huge dference – but it’s still not too late. HOCI has been used to great effect in South Korea and has been praised as a key reason why the country has kept its coronavirus cases low.Not only is the liquid sprayed on the streets, people entering and exiting certain public places have been doused in a mist of HOCI. Workers heading home at the end of shts have been walking through arches which blast hypochlorous acid from the sides. The practice is not unheard of in the UK, where dental workers use hand held spray guns to kill bacteria and viruses on surfaces.  Rugby and football clubs may soon be getting in on the act. Trimite, a company which distributes fogging tunnels, says it is in discussions with some clubs to have their products installed.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary.

There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

An MOT test will check the general condition of a tyre as well as the amount of tread it has, so its important to give them a thorough looking over. Make sure theyre inflated to the correct pressure too.The legal minimum tyre tread depth in the UK is .mm throughout a continuous band in the middle of the tyre. Tread gauges are the best way to check the depth, but you can use a p piece too - put the coin into a groove and the outer rim of the p piece is obscured, the tyre has enough tread. If you can see the outer rim, its definitely time for some new rubber.NUMBER PLATEIt can be easy to forget to check the number plate, but its an area which is checked during the test. Ensure its the right colour and that its fully legible too. It must also be the right size, too.HEADLIGHTS AND INDICATORSHeadlights and indicators are crucial to remaining safe on the road, which is why theyre a key part of the MOT test. Ensure theyre all working, and dont forget to test the hazard lights too!BRAKE LIGHTSIf you want to let people know that youre slowing down, then brake lights are a key - and legal - must. One of the easiest ways to check them over is to reverse up to a reflective surface - such as a window or shiny garage door - then press the brake pedal and check in the rear-view mirror to ensure theyre working.SEATS AND SEAT BELTSFront seats should have a good range of motion, so slide them forward and back to make sure everything is moving freely and easily. Seat belts should be checked over properly too pull them in and out to check theyre operating correctly and give them a sharp tug as well to make sure that they react as they should doa crash were to occur.HORNWhile youre inside the car, test out the horn and make sure it works - this is something that testers will check straight away.SCREENWASHThe majority of the checks on this list are easy to work out, but checking the screenwash is something that many people forget to do. An MOT centre can fail a cartheres not enough screenwash in the bottle ndash so its crucial that you check to see its filled to the proper level.WINDSCREENAnd while were on the subject of being able to see out of a car properly, its a good time to check over the windscreen. Any damage larger than mm will result in a fail, so look out for any stone chips or cracks.WINDSCREEN WIPERSWhile youre checking over the windscreen, give the wipers a thorough look too. They should be able to effectively clear the screen, leaving no streaks or making a rubbing noise. If thats the case, replace them ndash its a two-minute job on the vast majority of cars.ENGINE FLUIDS AND LEVELSIts best to make sure your car has plenty of fuel in the tank before you put it into its MOT, and its possible that you could be turned away from the test centreit doesnt have enough petrol or diesel. The same goes for engine oil ndash so check the levels of this are correct too."},{"url":null,"title":"absolutely-vital-shop-local-save-high-streets","story":"The Scotland Loves Local campaign has launched across the country to encourage Scots to go back to their roots, think local first and support their local high streets safely and in line with public healthguidelines.The Coronaviruspandemic has hit high streets and local businesses hard - now is the time to support them to get back on their feet.

believe fundamentally, especially now having done thousands of talks in schools and festivals over the last  years, that humans generally reach peak curiosity at the age of nine or ,\" Lloyd

where youre old enough to know that you have an identity and youre curious enough to want to know where you fit in.\"Theres nothing you cant talk to a nine or -year-old about ndash provided you dont patronise them, provided you dont have an expectation of them that they cant meet.\"If you can meet them as fellow kindred spirits on this rock travelling around the sun, in this incredible galaxy,

east end of High Street, it would be ldquoconverting part of Elcho Green to a temporary car park to support access to the High Street area.It stated that ldquofollowing a meeting with local traders, North Berwick CommunityCouncil and North Berwick Coastal Area Partnership, agreement has been reached to introduce a number of temporary measures in the town ndash but both the community council and area partnership told the Courier they had not given backing to the Elcho Green changes.The councilrsquos own timetable had Elcho Green car park opening last Friday .An online petition, West Bay not Parking Bay, to ldquoprotect stunning and iconic West Bay in North Berwick, was launched by resident Sarah Russell and had attracted more than , signatures in less than a week.It said: ldquoEast Lothian Council have announced plans to turn Elcho Green into a longstay car park.ldquoWhilst the council state that this is a temporary measure to comply with their Covid Spaces for People initiative, it is greatly feared that this will, in fact, lead to a permanent car park in the most iconic seafront location in East Lothian.\"North Berwick residents and visitors alike will be robbed of the very essence of this beautul recreational space that personies this famous conservation area seafront.ldquoTemporary or otherwise, Elcho Green is not the correct location for any car parking

winning Solheim Cup team.The Courier has been swamped with letters and emails against the plans .The scheme was described as ldquoindefensible and ldquoundemocratic vandalism by some residents, while many asked why there had not been specic consultation on the plan and highlighted that the land had been gted to the town by the late Sir Hew Hamilton-Dalrymple for recreational use in .On Monday, East Lothian Council released a statement that it was placing the ldquoElcho Green temporary car parking proposal on hold to allow us a further opportunity to engage and consult.It is the second time in a month that the councilrsquos plans to transform town centres have hit the buffers.Earlier in July, proposals to suspend parking in town centres were put ldquoon hold after traders and residents in Haddington reacted with anger as cones and parking suspension signs were put up overnight, sparking widespread concern.In Mondayrsquos statement, Councillor Norman Hampshire , environment spokesperson, said: ldquoEast Lothian Council has successfully implemented a number of physical distancing measures on North Berwick High Street to support the need for safe access to the town centre and economic recovery.ldquoA further support for Spaces for People was a proposal to utilise a small part of Elcho Green in North Berwick as a temporary car park.ldquoThe benefit of this would have been a reduction in the number of vehicles circling and queuing for parking spaces, enhanced safety for pedestrians and cyclists within the town centre, and improved air quality.ldquoEast Lothian Council is a listening authority and we are aware of the ious perspectives being raised within the North Berwick community.ldquoAs such, we intend to place the Elcho Green temporary car parking proposal on hold to allow us a further opportunity to engage and consult.\"This delay will also enable us to monitor the impact of increased traffic as a result of visitors and to assess the effectiveness of measures introduced.Councillor Stuart Currie, SNP Group leader, said that recent u-turns were down to a ldquolack of political leadership within the Labour administration.He said he received more than  emails objecting to the Elcho Green plans.He called for a report on the Spaces for People plans, and in particular parking proposals in North Berwick, to be put before a meeting of elected council group leaders in two weeksrsquo time for approval.Under emergency Covid- procedures, normal council business is currently suspended and decisions are taken at monthly meetings of the group leaders and council chief executive.He said: ldquoThe decision must be approved by councillors at the leadersrsquo group meeting and it should be open and transparent and open to the press.Mr Hampshire accused Mr Currie of ldquoplaying politics in ldquoan emergency situation.ldquoWe have allowed him to take part in the meetings with officers at every point during the discussions, said Mr Hampshire.ldquoI have got to say the Conservative Group have been fully behind what we are doing.\"For the SNP to try to play politics in a situation where their own Government is instructing local authorities to create spaces in town centres is unbelievable.Conservative councillor Craig Hoy called on the administration to ldquotake notice of the recent problems caused by parking proposals.He said the Scottish Government had failed to give councils enough time to push through emergency Covid measures in town centres.Councillor Hoy said: \"Scottish Councils are operating under huge pressure with limited resources, but that does not remove the need for them to consult fully and communicate clearly on big issues which impact our communities.\"I hope East Lothian Council and the Labour administration will take notice of the recent problems in North Berwick and fully engage with stakeholders.\"Hilary Smith, chair of North Berwick Coastal Area Partnership, stressed that the area partnership had not attended any meeting regarding Covid- plans for the town or given its approval to the plans.North Berwick Community Council said it had not discussed Elcho Green prior to its

Berwick.In response to questions from the Courier, the council said: ldquoThe high school and sports centre are both due to re-open in coming weeks so were unsuitable to use.ldquoAn area of Elcho Green is considered suitable to take traffic arriving from the west to park for people visiting the town to intercept the flow of traffic and stop vehicles circulating through the town unnecessarily searching for parking spaces and generating additional traffic pollution.ldquoIt also seemed reasonable considering the area of land is used annually for Fringe by the Sea events.\"A maximum of

In this monthly column, she shares her wildle diary ndash and pictures!DURING lockdown, I was trying to make the most of my free time ndash going on daily walks, working on my website, editing photos from before lockdown, designing my first book and completing A LOT of jigsaws .After the lockdown restrictions started to ease, I was able to spend even more time outdoors than I would normally do. I dedicated June to visiting dferent local sites to watch the kingfisher ndash which you may remember from my previous article ndash a family of wrens and the brown hares.One evening, as I was uploading my photographs on to social media and searching through the pages, I came across a few images of a bird that every birder wanted to see since its influx to the UK was published. It was a rosy starling!The beautul rosy starlinglooks nothing like the starlings we know. It strongly resembles a magpiewith a much shorter tail.This species is unmistakable in its adult plumage. The male has a pale pink body with a black head, wings, and tail. Additionally, during the breeding season the male develops a wispy crest and the black colour becomes glossier with a purplish green or blue sheen.The female is less vibrant than the male. Both sexes appear much duller outside of their breeding season.Furthermore, the rosy starling does not mimic other species, unlike its well-known cousin.What the two species have in common is murmuration ndash an astonishing and mesmerising aerial spectacle large flocks of these birds gather and perform a real show as they swoop, e and swirl across the sky in beautul shape-shting clouds. It is a phenomenon that pleases the eye of every observer.The rosy starlingrsquos breeding area stretches from the Balkans and Turkey to Central Asia and north-west China. It spends winters in India and south-east Arabia. As a strongly migratory species, it can travel outside of its normal breeding range. As a result, there are signicant periodic summer and autumn influxes in western Europe. The causes of such irruptions are not yet fully understood however, it appears to be related to changes in the population of locusts on which the birds feed.Imagine my amazement when I read that one of those birds had landed and made its temporary home in someonersquos garden in Port Seton!The cherry on the cake was that the night when I saw the first images of the rosy starling in East Lothian, I also received an email from Stuart Payne ndash the lucky host of the rosy starling. Stuart invited me to his garden.The next morning, my fianceacute Chris and I rushed to Port Seton. As we were walking towards Stuartrsquos house, we saw another birder looking around hoping to spot the rosy starling. As soon as we arrived at Stuartrsquos house, I saw this magnicent pink bird flying past the house and landing on the bird feeder to start its feast.Stuart and his we Gillian welcomed us in their garden, where I spent half an hour photographing the gorgeous rosy starling and chatting to Stuart and Gillian. I also took some time to admire their beautul dogs Hugo and Hobbes. These dogs were just wonderful, not every day you see dogs as well behaved as these two!My first and, I hope, not last experience with the rosy starling was unforgettable!

plans to transform tourist hotspot North Berwickrsquos town centre and create a temporary -space car park on its iconic Elcho Green ndash a much-loved publicspace and putting green.The response from the community, including Solheim Cup captain Catriona Matthew, who voiced concern at losing green space like the Green, saw those plans also shelved as the local authority insisted it was a ldquolistening council and would carry out further consultation.The latest plan for a three-metre-wide cycle lane between Prestonpans and Cockenziewill see dozens of painted stones created by local schoolchildren, which line the footpath, moved however, the council said it has agreed with the local community council for them to be collected and relocated across he road.Councillor Norman Hampshire, environment spokesperson, said: ldquoWe received many comments in the public consultation around Spaces for People on the need to provide suitable space for people cycling.ldquoMany people are currently cycling this route and we need to cater for the current increase in cyclists during the Covid- pandemic period.ldquoIn common with other Spaces for People measures, this route is for temporary use as we gradually move out of restrictions and will also provide a viable alternative to the use of the private car and or public transport for shorter-distanced essential or leisure trips in the area.The works will also include the introduction of temporary crossings of Edinburgh Road at either end of the route through the use of lsquobuildoutsrsquo and bolt-down bollards.MrHampshire added: ldquoWe were aware of a collection of painted stones that have been carefully laid by local schoolchildren alongside the existing footway along Edinburgh Road and recognise that these are important to the local community.ldquoThe community council has arranged for these to be carefully collected prior to the start of the works and have been relocated on the other side of the road."},{"url":null,"title":"column-job-figures-worrying","story":"Furloughing has worked but unemployment is creeping up.Keeping folk in work and creating new jobs through investment in necessary

they do not want to take either the health or financial risk of booking one. So the lure of the staycation has become attractive to many for the first time and, luckily being in East Lothian, we have plenty to keep us entertained.We have a huge number of attractions, whether that be our numerous world-renowned golf courses, the nationally recognised National Museum of Flight and Scottish Seabird Centre in North Berwick, or as one of Scotlandrsquos premier coastal destinations for food and drink.What always interests me is that there is so much available that not everyone knows everything. I am often struck by people not knowing some of the sites in my ward of Preston, Seton and Gosford. Therefore, I thought this week I would take the opportunity to plug them and encourage you to visit us.To start in the west of the ward in Prestonpans exists the Prestonpans Murals Trail, which is made of over  pieces of art, and depicts the townrsquos culture and history.This includes murals on its witch hunts, industrial past, the influence on famous conservationist John Muirrsquos early le, and relation with migration both to and from Scotland ndash well worth a few hoursrsquo walk around the town.Also in the town there is the unappreciated Preston Tower, a structure with parts still standing from the th century. It is a one-of-a-kind building, with dferent parts and floors having been added over the years and other bits destroyed since it was first built.Currently it isnrsquot open but Prestonpans Community Council has been pushing to get it in a fit state so that the people of Prestonpans can truly benefit from this one-of-a-kind building.Moving east into Cockenzie and Port Seton, next to the harbour is the  Waggonway Museum. It is a fantastic museum and project that tells the story of the arearsquos extensive industrial history, including of the Tranent-Cockenzie Waggonway, built in  and associated with the coal and salt industries.Nearby sits Cockenzie House, a mansion and gardens dating from the th century. It is now home to a brilliant wee cafe and numerous craft businesses well worth a visit.In between Longniddry and Port Seton sits Seton Colligate Church, considered ldquoone of the finest medieval collegiate churches in Scotland. It was built in the late s by landowner Lord Seton so the community of priests could pray for his familyrsquos salvation.Finally on the coast there is Longniddry Bents, East Lothian largest tourist attraction. It is a beautul stretch of coastline home to a large iety of wildle, including many types of birds, voles and seals.Soyou are having a staycation this summer, visit the Preston, Seton and Gosford area and, whilst here, support our local cafes, shops, restaurants and pubs."},{"url":null,"title":"letter-it-act-vandalism","story":"Today we are faced with a proposal to turn part of one of these beautul natural sites, in a designated conservation area, into an unsightly car park.Having been born and brought up in North Berwick and able to take advantage of the foresight of our forefathers, I was astonished to find not only that the proposal had been lsquoapprovedrsquo, but that it had been made at all. This is a vulnerable site and the suggestion of lsquotemporaryrsquo use is no guarantee.I am well aware of the problems of parking in our commercially vibrant High Street and all the efforts made over the years to come up with a solution.But parking cars on Elcho Green, a uniquely placed recreational facility for young and old, is not one of them.

Im a good test subject given Ive never met a midge that doesnt like me.I still bear the scars ndash mental and physical ndash of a long weekend in Glen Coe a few years ago. It was July. There was cloud cover, no wind and a sticky humidity. I was almost eaten alive.Scotlands walks are never complete without the dreaded midgeBelieve me, I have tried everything to keep the midges at bay. Among the long list of suggestions that Ive given a whirl are eating Marmite sandwiches, spraying a fine mist of Listerine and taking garlic tablets .Smoke can act as a deterrent, which has seen me huddling next to barbecues and bonfires like they are two-bar electric fires on cold winter mornings.Ive donned midge nets that give me the forlorn air of a beekeeper who has lost her hive, or a grieving Victorian widow. Im considering putting up bat boxes after reading that a lone bat can eat , midges in one night.Citronella and Saltidinare among the ingredients that midges are said to find repugnant and give a wide berth. Essential oils such as eucalyptus, lavender and lemongrass have been credited with similar properties .The midge has a mighty reputation for such a miniscule insect. Weighing just one th of a gram, it has a teeny wingspan of -mm.

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

Robert Adamrsquos clf-top mansion overlooks the Firth of Clyde near Maybole in Ayrshire and is certainly a huge symbol of privilege and wealth. However, standing as it does in a  hectare estate of parks, woodland, beaches and clftops it makes an excellent destination for an autumnal daytrip and this shortish walk enables you to see the best of it.The castle itself was built in the late th century and was commissioned by David Kennedy, the Earl of Cassillis, a man who was apparently lsquokeen to impress with his wealth and statusrsquo. He wanted the lsquocountry housersquo to be the seat of his earldom.Later in its le Culzean Casle became the home of the Marquis of Ailsa, Chief of the Clan Kennedy but in , facing crippling inheritance tax, the family gave the building and grounds to the National Trust for Scotland who continue to look after it to this day. A suite of rooms on the top floor were given to US President Dwight D Eisenhower in recognition of his role as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe during the Second World War. When I was a youngster I was more impressed by the fact that the Scottish entertainer Jimmy Logan lived in a rented apartment in the castle.Irsquom not a great fan of country houses but I was keen to have a walk around the grounds and, as much as possible, gaze on its clf-top setting from the sea-shore. To reach the clfs I dropped down some steps by the castle entrance to reach the castle gardens from where a path through a gap in the wall led me into a grassy area. A track led me through some fine deciduous woods before dropping down to reach the very attractive Swan Pond. I passed along its north shore before following a signpost to the clfs.This is the best part of the walk with views across the Firth of Clyde towards Arran and the low-lying Kintyre Peninsula beyond. There are good views too of Paddyrsquos Milestone, or the Ailsa Craig as it is properly known. And itrsquos here that you get the best appreciation of how well situated Culzean Castle is. It absolutely dominates the shoreline, and I guess that was the intention of Robert Adam the architect.I wandered along to the end of the path before ing to the Swan Pond and the road back to the car park. All the way along I kept wondering what the view from the Eisenhower apartment must be like, gazing out onto that great spread of water and the wonderful skyline of the Isle of Arran. Alas, Eisenhower only visited his apartment half a dozen times.

The makers of the first Scottish Gin distilled with hand-picked tea have been slowly expanding their list of stockists across Scotland and the UK. saw them collect another swathe of awards including the Spirits Business Masters Medal for their packaging and design of their flagship product The Teasmith Original. They also released Broich Single Estate ndash a limited edition gin featuring tea grown right here in Scotland.Why tea  Because Scotland has many historical links with the tea trade with several stemming from Aberdeenshire which is where the Founders are based. When they discovered the story of James Taylor ndash a young man from the area - who grew the very first commercial tea plantation in British Ceylon, they worked with tea consultant Beverly Wainwright to source a special loose leaf tea from the Amba Estate in Sri Lanka.It is both hand-picked and hand-rolled ndash much in the same way Taylor produced his first batches  years ago on the island.When distilled, the tea provides fabulous citrus notes of blood orange along with a minty sweetness. These flavours are paired with more classic gin botanicals such as juniper, coriander seed, dried orange peel, angelica and orris root and a sprinkle of rose petals to create a smooth and fresh juniper-led gin with a citrusy lingering sweetness.The Teasmith Gin doesnrsquot disappoint. A truly smooth classic dry style gin packaged in a beautully simple bottle with lots of hidden hand-finishes ndash it ticks all the boxes.Serve this gin with copious ice, a premium quality tonic and sprig of fresh mint for a truly crisp and refreshing GT. The founders used their recent time in lockdown to completely refresh their website and provide a nice range of cocktail suggestions too! So check out the dferent ways you could enjoy The Teasmith Gin this summer.The Teasmith Gin is available through The Teasmith Ginrsquos website for pound. or through the Master of Malt.

A golden summer. The Scottish independence referendum was yet to take place. There was no Brexit.

But it extends much further and deeper ndash a prime example is Army@TheFringe. which we have run in association with Summerhall since .It enables performing artists to present shows that raise issues about le in and out of unorm, and normally takes place at the Hepburn House drill hall which we transform into an Edinburgh Fringe venue.As head of the arts for the ArmyI believe itrsquos essential for us to work with, and support, independent artists. In fact, itrsquos more important now than ever given the number and scale of concerns we all face in todayrsquos world, from racism and inequality to love, hate, peace and war.The arts have an unrivalled capacity to make us think and feel about our world ndash what it was like in the past, how it is now and where itrsquos heading. By encouraging us to ask questions of ourselves, and others, they can promote debate and lay the foundations for positive change.When Covid- forced the cancellation of the Fringe we decided to move online and refocused in order to offer some support to the artists we were already working with and to the wider performing arts sector. The result is Army@TheVirtualFringe ndash three weeks of free screenings, workshops, rehearsed readings, discussions and live-from-home performances.Some give a foretaste of productions we aim to stage next year. But many will see writers, performers, set designers, photographers, musicians and others sharing ideas and expertise with performing artists hoping to put on shows where at the Fringe ndash or indeed anywhere.With the mountainous dficulties faced by the sector right now we hope this kind of skills sharing will contribute to the efforts so many people are making to help the performing arts rebuild. And for the public we hope that what we are offering will, alongside other recently announced initiatives, provide some continuity and fill a little of the gap left by the absence of the Fringe.We also want to give something back to an arts community which has shown so much interest in Army@TheFringe and has come to us with productions of the quality of  Soldiers, The Troth and Unicorns, Almost.As a photographer myself I try to capture images that have an authenticity and express something new or dferent about people or situations. Thatrsquos very much the essence of Army@TheFringe and other initiatives through which the Army engages with the arts. They support work that is powerful, informed and independent.In some cases they do that by inviting artists who want to create work about the Army to come ldquobehind the wire and give them access to the kind of people and experiences that interest them.At other times they provide a showcase for veterans who now work in the arts and whose work reflects lived experience.Both result in an authenticity that make productions all the more affecting and persuasive whether they are addressing how families cope with death or injury, the courage of gay soldiers in coming out, womenrsquos struggle for equality or the experiences of black and overseas personnel.The result is agenda-setting art that asks tough questions about our lives and our Army ndash something that matters greatly for a healthy, open society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-tell-us-england-plans-fix-economy","story":"Scots know that the UK has a pound trillion national debt and that is before you add the conveniently ignored pound billion created through quantitative easing to rescue the corrupt banking system or the pound billion the Bank of England invented a few weeks ago to give to the Treasury or the gaping deficit there will be in this yearrsquos Westminsterrsquos annual budget because of the Covid- pandemicrsquos devastating effect on the UK GDP. Westminster hasnrsquot balanced the books for years and the impending disaster caused by Brexit will only make things worse, we understand all of that.

Any money Scotland gets from Westminster through the Barnett formula is not English largesse but simply some of our taxes being ed to where they were gathered.I reverse the question on our Unionist friends. What we Scots want to know is what England is going to do about the financial mismanagement of the UK economy, because the elected representatives we send to Westminster to reflect the views of the Scottish people simply cannot influence in any meaningful way what Westminster does. The facts are glaringly obvious that, despite years of austerity, England has failed to address fundamental flaws in our common economy and has compounded problems that have had and are having a detrimental effect on all the parts of our supposed union of equals. The distribution of wealth and its concentration in south-east England tells one all one needs to know about the role that Westminster plays and who controls it.

Dferent communities with dferent identities and dferent priorities. I do not see one homogenous nation.As a person with very deep roots in the Celtic West I feel far greater affinity with the people of Ireland than I do with many of the communities further east and south. This is not a conscious choice, rather a statement of personal orientation and belonging.The people of the Highlands and Islands have had an exceptionally poor deal from Edinburgh and its Lowland bastions in recent centuries. Infor backing the wrong horse in the , our precious Highland and Hebridean heartland has been decimated, its people and language oppressed, subjugated, burnt out and cleared. Are we supposed to say thank you As we move towards a second defining vote on our constitutional future I wonderI am alone in not wanting to be a pawn in a game that involves Edinburgh replacing Westminster only for Edinburgh then to cede power to Brussels  Why would you do that  Why work so hard and build so many expectations only to achieve so little If I am to vote for change then it has to mean something tangible and not simply switching one uncaring master for another. I will not be convinced that rejoining the EU is anything other than being party to a European Project that will ultimately lead to the creation of a new country called Europe. Whither Scotia then Can I perhaps dream of a new Atlantic nation from Argyll and the Clyde Islands to Caithness with a border on the Highland line  In control of its own destiny, freed from Lowland control yet living respectfully alongside one another We have great natural resources, pure water, clean air, abundant capacity for energy generation, magnetic scenery to draw the tourists, wide open spaces, world-leading foods and whisky and, above all, brilliant people with global reach. Who knows what we can achievewe can turn dust to seed, reap our own harvest and ring our own till Ill be honest and admit that I have no idea at this stage whether or not the people of the Highlands and Islands remotely share such a vision and how this could work economically but, in an age of iconoclasm and the redefinition of identity, no Lowland politician should assume that an independent Scotland would not, in turn, find itself broken up in time by those of us wishing to assert their fundamental right to self-determination.As the creation of Holyrood emboldened nationalism, so I hope that independence will, in turn, trigger an explosion in regional identity politics within Scotland itself. One step at a time.Fraser Kelly, Millport.THERE is a simple answer to Maggie Chettys questionwhy the Prime Minster wants to hang on to Scotland. It is because that is what the people of Scotland voted for in , in a fair and free democratic referendum. You would think she might remember that.Her letter also includes a fascinating reference to the UK benefiting from ious taxes, although of course the Scottish Governments own figures tell us that Scotland gets more out of the Union by way of revenues than it puts in. The tax mentioned by Ms Chetty that is most intriguing is the one on whisky, which looks an awful lot like the mythical whisky export tax so beloved of nationalist conspiracy theorists. Likewise, she has now added a fish tax and a beef tax.Which all begs a much better question than Ms Chettys:Scottish independence is such a great idea, why do its proponents have to tell so many lies to justy it Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.THERE seems to be growing concern that interpretation of the Hate Crime Bill presently going through Holyrood would have an adverse effect on freedom of speech , particularly as regards the aspect of \"stirring up hatred\" Could those of us who write to The Herald then run the risk of being accused of that crime by the overly sensitive taking offence at our use of language criticising them, their views or their actions and as a consequence stirring up hatred in their own breastnot where  The letterfrom David Stubley provides an interesting case study in what to me appears to be its deliberate use of language chosen in sum to be inflammatory and personally derogatory viz ldquolackeys\", \"toadying\", \"fallacious\", \"lie\", \"charlatan parties and their willing acolytes\", ldquo proven liar\" and \"used car salesman\".

seeks to change someones sexuality or gender identity ndash is a \"risk to public health\" and should be made a criminal offence.It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson called conversion therapy \"absolutely abhorrent\" and said the UK Government willbring forward plans to ban it.Stars such as Sir Elton John have also recently backed calls to outlaw it.A petition has now been lodged in Holyrood calling on the Scottish Government to take action, attracting thousands of signatures and support from high-profile LGBT organisations.Tristan Gray, one of those named on the petition, said:\"We only discovered that its not already illegal quite recently, and we were quite shocked by it.\"The Scottish Government said conversion therapy is \"unethical, harmful and has no place in Scotland\".However, it said the legislative timetable for the current parliamentary session \"is currently fully committed\".It said it \"fully support moves by the UK Government to end conversion therapy\" and will engage with officials ondevolved and reserved responsibilities.Gray,who is on the Scottish Greens policy committee, said conversion therapy is \"putting someone through a process that would erase their LGBT identity\".He pointed to moves to ban it in Canada, where officials have defined it as seeking \"to change an inidualrsquos sexual orientation to heterosexual, to repress or reduce non-heterosexual attraction or sexual behaviours, or to change an inidualrsquos gender identity to match the sex they were assigned at birth\".The Canadian legislation, which was introduced earlier this year, proposes five new criminal offences related to conversion therapy.These include causing a minor to undergo conversion therapy,causing a person to undergo it against their will and profiting from or advertising conversion therapy.The Holyrood petitioners insist the practice has \"damaged generations of LGBT+ young people and adults and continues to do so\".They quoted a report from the charity Stonewall, which found  per cent of health and care staff had witnessed colleagues expressing the view that lesbian, gay and bisexual people can be ldquocured of their sexual orientation.They also referenced a survey by theOzanne Foundation, which works withreligious organisations to eliminate discrimination based on sexuality or gender.This found .% of respondents had ldquobeen advised to consider attempts to change their sexual orientationand just over one in sevenhad ldquovoluntarily considered it.The petitioners said: \"Concerningly, .% of LGBT+ respondents had been forced to go through attempts to change their sexual orientation.\"Almost two-thirds, .%, had \"suffered from mental health issues\" as a result of the conversion therapy, including nearly a third who said they had attempted suicide.The Holyrood petition notes: \"These responses clearly show that there is a signicant public health case for banning conversion therapy.\"The experiences of those who were put through this practice show that enforcing this ban should fall under criminal law.\"Both of these areas fall within the devolved powers of the Scottish Parliament.\"It said the UK Government has yet to act despite committing to end the practice years ago.It added: \"Given this information, it is clear that conversion therapy is a risk to public health, especially the mental health of vulnerable young adults and children.\"There is broad support for its criminalisation by those who have been subjected to it, and, as healthcare and criminal justice matter, we believe it to be within the scope of the Scottish Governmentrsquos powers to ensure this practice is brought to an end.\"Gray raised concerns the UK plans will be kicked into the long grass.The -year-old said: \"I think it should fall under criminal law, and that is something that is shared by people who have undergone it.\"People who have been through conversion therapy overwhelmingly support it being banned, and I think half of them support it being an area for criminal law.\"I think they are the people who should be listened to on this.\"People who have been subjected to conversion therapy should be the people we listen to most.\"I think it should come down under criminal law, and I think the justication for that partly includes it being a public health issue.\"He said it is an issue that should gain \"universal support\" from Scotlands political parties.Jordan Daly, co-founder of Time for Inclusive Education , a charity working to address anti-LGBT bullying in schools, is one of those backing the petition.He said: ldquoConversion or reparative therapies should have been outlawed a long time ago, and practices which ly claim to change, cure or repair an inidualrsquos sexual orientation or gender identity or expression have been shown time and again to be emotionally and psychologically traumatic on those who have experienced and survived such programs.\"He said practices which rely on \"using emotionally exploitative tactics to encourage feelings of shame and repression in iniduals are active in Scotland right now\".He added: \"We support this petition and the efforts of campaigners to continue raising awareness about the existence of dangerous and shameful practices in our country.\"Scotland has an opportunity to lead the UK here, and ensure that no other LGBT person, young or old, experiences this ndash ministers and parliamentarians should not delay in taking it.SNP equalities minister Christina McKelvie said: ldquoWe do not support or advocate the practice of conversion therapy.\"It is unethical, harmful and has no place in Scotland.\"We fully support moves by the UK Government to end conversion therapy, and are engaging with them as they

Goebbels. Halax, an architect of appeasement, wanted to ensure peace between Nazi Germany and Britain. One of his first tasks after the Berlin trip was to contact the publishers of the Evening Standard about the problematic matter of a cartoonist called David Low.Throughout the s, Low had lampooned Hitler in the pages of the British press. Halax told the Standard: ldquoYou cannot imagine the frenzy these cartoons cause. As soon as a copy of the Evening Standard arrives, it is pounced on for Lowrsquos cartoons, andit is of Hitler, as it usually is, telephones buzz, tempers rise, fevers mount, and the whole government system of Germany is in uproar.Nobody at the paper would rein in Low, so it fell to Halax to intercede personally. He took Low to lunch and laid his cards on the table. Low listened and replied: ldquoDo I understand you to say that you would find it easier to promote peacemy cartoons did not irritate the Nazi leaders personally Halax said yes. Low later explained: ldquoOf course, he was the foreign secretary hellip So I said, lsquoVery well, I donrsquot want to be responsible for a world warrsquo.In his own words, Low ldquoslowed down a bit. That didnrsquot last long, though. No cartoonist could resist satirising Hitler. Kicking the living hell out of power is part of the job description, after all.Soon Low would go on to draw his masterpiece, ldquoRendezvous, which satirised the grotesquely cynical peace deal between Hitler and Stalin ndash the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact that helped pave the path to war. In the cartoon, Hitler and Stalin are shown courteously meeting each other across a dead body. Hitler doffs his cap and says charmingly, ldquoThe scum of the earth, I believe . Stalin replies, with equal grace, ldquoThe bloody assassin of the workers, I presume .Low understood exactly the power of his pen. He once said: ldquoNo dictator is inconvenienced or even displeased by cartoons showing his terrible person stalking through blood and mud. That is the kind of idea about himself that the power-seeking world-beater would want to propagate. It not only feeds his vanity, but unfortunately it shows profitable s in an awed world. What he does not want to get around is the idea that he is an ass, which is really damaging. And there, in one historical vignette, the power of the political cartoon is neatly summed up.Bye bye BellTherersquos been much worry over the future of satire in Britain and the rest of the Western world of late, as so-called cancel culture wends its way through all avenues of the media from film to print. A short while ago, it emerged thatnewspaper was not to renew the contract of its cartoonist Steve Bell. The move came not long after the departure of a senior editor at another bastion of the so-called liberal press, The New York Times. James Bennet had published a piece by a republican senator calling for military force to put down violent protests. It caused outrage. He resigned. A high-profile columnist with the paper then also resigned. Bari Weiss claimed the paper was effectively being edited by Twitterrsquos ldquowoke brigade.Steve Bellrsquos cartooning is brutal, hersquos cruel. Depending on your political point of view, hersquos a comic genius one day, an utter villain the next. His withering caricatures can define a politician and overshadow their career. Bellrsquos portrayal of John Major wearing his Y-fronts over his trousers summed up the mediocrity of the man as Prime Minister. Hersquos drawn David Cameron as a human condom, and George Osborne as an SM gimp. His portrayal of Alex Salmond as a Saltire-faced, tartan oaf riled nationalists during the  referendum. Likewise, his cartoon of Margaret Thatcher, after her death, sliding into hell and asking ldquowhy is this pit still open  outraged Conservatives.Deliberately upsetting people, using nasty stereotypes, punching below the belt ndash when it comes to dealing with power Bell, like most great cartoonists, is happy to use any tactic. However, hersquos also faced opprobrium over some of his cartoons such as one showing Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu holding Tony Blair like a glove puppet. The cartoon was seen as playing with anti-Semitic tropes. Recently his caricature of Home Secretary Priti Patel also got him in serious trouble. He drew Patel quite literally as a fat cow, complete with a ring in her nose. As Patel is of Hindu origin, and the cow scared in Hinduism, he brought fury down upon himself.Soon, amid newspaper layoffs, it emerged that his contract was scheduled not to be renewed. The Jewish Chronicle reported that the moves were ldquosaid to be unrelated to the latest round of redundancies. In June , Bell clashed with rsquos top executives when he complained that he felt ldquounfairly traduced and censored after the paper wouldnrsquot run a cartoon showing a Palestinian burning in a fireplace while Netanyahu and Theresa May sit talking. Bell said editor Katharine Viner did ldquonot really have an argument for spiking his drawing.A few days ago, Bell himself tweeted that his departure was nothing to do with Patel, but rather job cuts at the paper. However, his loss has prompted many in the media to speculate that hersquos another scalp for cancel culture.Wicked clownsIf the political cartoonist has an historical ancestor, itrsquos the court jester. In the medieval court, the jester could get away with anything. The jester could mock royalty, insult palace favourites, and point out the failings of everyone from bishops to potentates. Sometimes, jesters lost their heads, but mostly their patrons welcomed their caustic comedy. It reminded the powerful that they were human and could make stupid mistakes just like the rest of us.Of course, throughout the history of cartooning, not all artists have worked for the greater good or held power to account. Some have acted in bad faith and given succour to dictators like the cartoonists for Nazi newspapers such as Der Sturmer which drew Jews as devils and snakes.The most important issue for any political cartoon is this: what direction itrsquos punching. Is it punching up ndash at the powerful, greedy and dangerous  Or punching down at the weak  If we agree that punching up is the right thing to do ndash then is any tactic fair game  Can stereotypes be used  Until not so long ago, we expected cartoonists to deploy any trick in the book as long as they hit their mark ndash and most importantly made us laugh and think. Now, times are changing. Will that lessen the power of satire at a time when we need it most ndash in an era of populism, hate mobs, and unaccountable power and wealth  The bottom-line question for today is this: can a cartoon really workit is so sanitised that it upsets absolutely nobody The art of offenceIn his excellent book, The Art Of Controversy: Political Cartoons And Their Enduring Power, the American journalist Victor Navasky tells a story which sums up the impossibility of ever finding a cartoon which both hits its mark and offends nobody.Navasky was editing the US magazine The Nation when cartoonist David Levine brought him a drawing of Henry Kissinger ndash the former US secretary of state, seen by many on the left as a warmonger. The cartoon, ldquoScrewing the World, depicted the body of a woman with a head like a globe of the world lying on a bed, her fingers clutching the sheets. On top of her, his body just covered by a Stars and Stripes blanket, is Kissinger, his face contorted with wolfish pleasure. For some, the image absolutely expresses Kissingerrsquos treatment of the world. For others, and in this case many of the Nationrsquos staff, it was sexist and unacceptable.Navasky was collared by his team and asked: ldquoWhy isnrsquot he doing it to a Third World male Good question. But, of course,Kissinger had been shown raping an African man, itrsquos pretty obvious where the anger would come from regarding that reworked cartoon.A history of mischief and sufferingCartoons have been about since Egypt in BC ndash and theyrsquore always grotesque, cruel and offensive. Asking for a cartoonist not to cause offence is like asking a bird not to fly ndash itrsquos innate.Despite ancient caricaturists leaving scratchings in stone mocking almighty leaders like the Pharaoh Akhenaten, the political cartoon is really a creature of the modern age, finding its feet in the s with the English artists William Hogarth and James Gillray. Hogarth satirised society. He was a moralist who tried to expose the failings of the people ndash both rich and poor ndash in works like A Harlotrsquos Progress, A Rakersquos Progress and Gin Lane, a vision of a barbarous drunken London where alcohol is more important than the lives of children.Gillray had two main targets: the excesses of the French Revolution, and the greed of the British ruling class. In his cartoon The Plumb Pudding in Danger he shows the British Prime Minister William Pitt carving up the world with Napoleon. In other European countries at the time, such mockery could have ended with the artist on the gallows. Gillrayrsquos cartoon A Voluptuary Under the Horrors of Digestion portrays a fat, greedy, spoilt Prince Regent, who would go on to be George IV. When Gillray felt the press was too grovelling towards the Duchess of York he drew the cartoon The Duchessrsquos Little Shoes Yielding to the Magnitude of the Dukersquos Foot ndash which effectively showed the aristocratic pair having sex.By the early th century, cartoons were a staple of every newspaper in the democratic world. The cartoon was there to both reflect the politics of the paper and its readers, and to challenge their beliefs. Readers expected their daily cartoon to cause offence ndash either to them or others. And matters effectively stayed like that for the next century ndash although of course the cartoon went underground behind the Iron Curtain as it satirised the absurdities of Soviet le.Perhaps, the greatest practitioner of the modern cartoon is Ralph Steadman. Now aged , Steadman skewered the powerful from the late-s onwards. For instance, in his inimitable surreal, ink-splattered style he nailed the fear brought about by the rise of the former Hollywood actor Ronald Reagan to the US presidency.In Reaganrsquos Latest Close-Up, the President looms over Lady Liberty, holding her in a movie star embrace, while dressed as Dracula, his teeth sharp and ready to bite.But cartooning never comes without its cost. In , the Palestinian cartoonist Naji al-Ali ndash who lambasted both Israel and the PLO ndash was murdered on his way to work. In , the Sri Lankan cartoonist Jfry Yoonoos was beaten and stabbed. In , Yemenrsquos Saleh Ali was arrested after he published a cartoon showing a Yemeni man being arrested as one policeman declared ldquoDemocracy is what I say. In Cameroon, Belarus, Iran, and Syria, cartoonists have been subjected to violence, censorship and persecution.Some have said that the clash between cartooning and Islam represents the ultimate expression of cancel culture ndash the act of murdering someone because they caused you offence in art form.In , Denmarkrsquos Jyllands-Posten newspaper published cartoons mocking Islam. Many depicted Mohammed and were seen by Muslims as blasphemous. Death threats were made, cartoonists went into hiding, demonstrations began around the world. By , an estimated  people had been killed as a result of protests and anger.Some years later, in , the satirical French magazine, Charlie Hebdo, published a caricature of Mohammed on its front cover. Its offices were firebombed. In , the magazine published more cartoons deemed offensive to Islam. In January , Islamist terrorists attacked the magazinersquos office. Twelve people died, including cartoonists Cabu and Charb.In the immediate wake of the attack, the West embraced the slogan ldquoJe Suis Charlie as an expression of solidarity with artists murdered simply for daring to draw what they thought. However, quickly, that slogan began to stale for some.There are many who would now no longer stand with Charlie. The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Liberties went into victim-blaming mode. ldquoKilling in response to insult, no matter how gross, must be unequivocally condemned. That is why what happened in Paris cannot be tolerated. But neither should we tolerate the kind of intolerance that provoked this violent reaction, said its president Bill Donohue. He was not the only such voice.In this era of social media and political extremism, when offence-taking is as ubiquitous as sand on a beach, cartoonists find themselves in the crosshairs more than ever before in the Western world.When it comes to free speech, cartoons are often ugly speech. But thatrsquos the point ndash theyrsquore meant to offend. Andugly, offensive speech isnrsquot defended, what happens to the concept of free speech  A silent world without offence really would be no laughing matter."},{"url":null,"title":"ticket-prices-look-set-soar-venues-look-survive-post-pandemic-landscape","story":"Mass gatherings were the first social events to be banned by the Scottish Government in March as the realities of the Covid- crisis first swept across the country ndash and venues desperate to sell tickets to stay afloat are yet to reopen and havenrsquot even been handed a timescale of when they are likely to begin performances again.Festival bosses in Edinburgh, where all internationally-acclaimed summer events have been scrapped due to the pandemic, have warned MSPs that any plans to reopen venues with social distancing measures in place should include ldquoan exploration of either reduced or relaxed social distancing measures.:Barrowlands wonrsquot be allowed to die ndash well be backIn evidence submitted to Holyroodrsquos culture committee, the Edinburgh International Festival added that this relaxation should be ldquocoupled with the creation of a comprehensive set of guidance and equipment to enable venues to stage mass gatherings safely.The organisation has warned that ticket prices for cultural events could soar to mitigate costs and lack of revenue for venues.They added: ldquoThis may require help with the additional costs of staging safe events, including extra security and stewarding, pre-event checks, accommodation and equipment costs, and increased labour costs. These costs may amount to several pounds per attendee, an additional burden that will be impossible for nearly all venues in the sector to absorb.ldquoTherefore, it may be necessary to establish a subsidy for social measures, recognising venues can only operate at -% capacity at two metres distancing and -% at just one metre.Music venues in particular will struggle to make enough money to be viable with any sort of social distancing being required.Mark Davyd, chief executive of the Music Venue Trust, said: ldquoThe issue of the additional cost per attendee is certainly a concern and needs addressing.ldquoWe would highlight that at one metre, social distancing grass-roots music venues that are able to open, which is approximately one third of the spaces, can operate at an average % capacity.

Theatre buildings are designed on that premise.ldquoTo have performers socially distant would demand creation from scratch of an entirely new repertoire of work right across all performance genres.She added: ldquoFor obvious reasons large gatherings were first to close down, in the same vein we anticipate theatres to be the last to open up again.ldquoFrom having spoken to our network of venue operators across the country, the general consensus, at this point in time, is that March or April  is the most likely date for the theatre industry to restart.ldquoMargins for Capital Theatres, as a large-scale commercial operator, are tight. The success of our business model requires in the region of , audience visitors per year. Our ability to continue trading with what, at best, could be -% capacity in our auditoriums, allowing for distancing, simply does not stack up.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer. Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel. If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing. Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport. Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond. The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful. They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff. Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing. “We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping. “You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.”The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked. They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place. Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

Inner Wheel has Clubs right across the island of Ireland including in Ballymena. The local Club recently celebrated its th anniversary, Patricia has been involved in her local Club for around  years and, most recently, was Club President. Patricia said: “It is an immense honour to have the opportunity to lead our organisation. Although somewhat daunted by the responsibility which comes with the role of Chair I am nonetheless excited by the prospect for the year ahead. “The ongoing global pandemic undoubtedly brings enormous challenges for our organisation but by embracing the opportunities which technology offers there are ways in which we can keep the spirit of Inner Wheel alive. “I am immensely encouraged by the way in which our members have already adapted to the new normality. The gradual easing of restrictions will hopefully ensure that our ious activities can continue to take place.“As District Chair, I have chosen Special Olympics as my Charity for this year and I look forward to engaging with all of our Clubs in supporting this particular group – as well, of course, as the myriad of local charities which our members support over the years. I look forward to working closely with our friends across the Rotary family. I am also indebted to the members of my local Club for all of their encouragement and support.” Patricia took up her new role on  July and will continue for  months. She is planning to attend the International Inner Wheel Convention in Japur in India next Spring – subject, of course, to easing of travel restrictions.

This year, though, there was a real threat of #The Port# being the town that was all dressed up with nowhere to go.There had been no fanfare Easter weekend opening of family favourite Barry#s Amusements. The caravan parks were shut, hotels closed and apartments unavailable to visitors.Today there are still no screams of fright and delight, as the doors remain firmly shut on the famous old building that has attracted fun lovers through the decades. There#s no ride on the old ghost train. Copper coins will find a dferent home instead of the slots in the arcade.But where in the town the sparkle is starting to .The mums are back, tissues in hand to mop up dribbles of ice-cream from small faces. All the seats along the seafront are taken for a welcome breath of fresh north coast air. If anything, the town is busier than during last July#s Open. No golf to distract, no Barry#s to chuck p coins into those slots in the hope of winning a clatter of copper. Instead, visitors are nose to tail along the main street, and it#s come just in the nick of time for the shops and cafes.Andy Hill has been running Troggs Surf Shop since  and said Monday was one of the best he can remember.It#s incredibly busy. It#s all domestic custom, we#ve hardly seen a foreign tourist, he said.The beaches are very busy indeed. A lot of people were probably going stir crazy at home and just needed to see the ocean and get some salt water therapy.We#re selling an awful lot of body boards, surfboards and wetsuits. The beach is a natural asset that we have and it#s great to see people using it. Of course it#s a huge disappointment that Barry#s isn#t open, but people seem to be making the best of it, and thankfully the weather is helping.Monday was probably one of the busiest days I#ve ever had here. If everyone did holiday at home every year it would be a marvellous boost to the whole economy. Some will be quite surprised when they come here. A lot of visitors have been telling us what a brilliant time they#re having on the north coast.Along the street, Alice Rohdich presides over the family jewellers and souvenir shop, which has been in business since  and has never known a time like it.We#re missing the tourists from further afield, but we#re certainly making up for it with homegrown visitors, she said. The town has had to evolve this year. We can#t change what#s happening.We did invest in more Irish souvenirs this year as we#d expected more people from overseas on the back of the golf last year, but that hasn#t happened. But thankfully we#re getting our share of what#s going and we#re feeling much more positive. We would previously have had early morning and late evening trade, but now, with plenty of day trippers, the middle of the day is when most arrive. You can#t really visit Portrush without grabbing a stick of rock and Ann Lamont has been selling sweets and confectionery at Wilma#s just across from Barry#s.It has really picked up this last week, she said. We do sell some Irish souvenirs, but that#s not what people from Northern Ireland are after and that#s who we#ve had in the town.But they#re still able to get their sweets, buckets and spades.The weather has been good and usually, especially at nighttime, Barrys would be a big draw for us. Most of my family have worked in there at some stage.A few miles# drive along the Atlantic coast, Portstewart has always been known as a quieter seaside town than its neighbour, but it has reawakened with vigour over the past two weeks.There#s the usual crawl of traffic along the ocean front. Across the bay the sun glints once again off the cars lining the famous Strand. Orderly queues form outside the many ice-cream parlours. There are smiles again on faces as they take good of the fresh sea air. And customers are like a breath of fresh air, too, for the myriad of seafront shops.It#s great to have the doors open again and see people out and about again, said Siobhan Farthing at home and lestyle shop A Broader Picture.We#re obviously having to keep numbers down in the shop, but it#s such a relief to get the doors open again. There#s a real psychological boost to being by the sea and so many people have told us they#re delighted to be back.Missing out on their day by the seaside, though, were face coverings. Few and far between along the proms, it seems a decent face mask might be considered a hindrance to getting the full benefit of the sea air.

Both apps were designed by Co Waterford company NearForm.Speaking to the Belfast , Stephen Shaw from Big Motive, the company that designed the app, explained that there is a real concern amongst those involved in its development that the general public may not be aware just how useful the contact tracing service could be.You#re talking about avoiding potential future lockdowns, he stated. All of the code, information and everything about the app will be open sourced and public.Read More Pub worker blames coronavirus visor for fall down stairs and is suing Dublin barAnyone that#s worried about it tracking them will be able to access everything about the app and see and check that it#s not doing anything untoward.The Information Commissioner#s Office has been through everything. The higher echelons of the UK Government has scrutinised all elements of it too.People can be genuinely confident that it#s not doing anything dodgy.The app is compatible with the contact tracing service available in the Republic of Ireland and is expected to work with the app being created by the NHS in Great Britain.Mr Shaw explained that this is due to a federated server which is currently being developed for the app.This server will also allow the app to work with other European countries who have a tracing service in the same format, something Mr Shaw called a world first.When asked why Northern Ireland will be the first country in the United Kingdom to launch the app, Mr Shaw praised the work of the Department of Health#sChief Digital Information Officer, Dan West, and the app#s product manager, Dr Eddie O#Neill.Dan West is leading the project and he has been super dynamic and extremely good at bringing together all dferent aspects like the DoH and the Public Health Agency, he said.Along with Dr Eddie O#Neill, the pair of them seem to have a great handle on the subtleties of what technology should be used. The two of them have been instrumental.Meanwhile, Health Minister Robin Swann has asked his cross-border counterpart to consider new laws and data-sharing agreements to help track international travellers arriving on the island.Mr Swann has written to Stephen Donnelly expressing concern about the inability of both jurisdictions to capture and share information about passengers transiting through one part of the island to the other. In the letter, Mr Swann told Mr Donnelly that his officials were facing serious impediments in monitoring travellers who cross the border having landed in the Irish Republic from an at-risk country.Such passengers are required to self-isolate in Northern Ireland for  days.Mr Swann said the system was reliant on people filling in a passenger locator form within  hours of entering Northern Ireland.He saidthey failed to fill in those forms, the authorities north of the border had no way of tracing them.

Enforcement and Removal Operations Boston officers still continue their duties even during these trying times.He added: Those who believe they can hide in the US from their crimes including terrorist activities they committed in other countries are in for a rude awakening. ICE remains committed to removing dangerous foreign nationals from the US, even those who may have managed to evade immigration law for a y period of time.The statement added: ICE is focused on removing public safety threats, such as convicted criminal aliens and gang members, as well as iniduals who have violated our nation#s immigration laws and those convicted of terrorist activities, including those who illegally re-entered the country after being removed and immigration fugitives ordered removed by federal immigration judges.Belfast Most ReadBelfast cafe owner Whearty angers her former staff over alleged unpaid wagesThe Earl and Countess of Erne on their magical wedding and le at Crom CastleFormula  legend Eddie Irvine partied with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in New York and MiamiCoronavirus: Travellers arriving in Northern Ireland from Spain to quarantine for  daysIRA bomber released under peace deal deported from United States ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The -year-old Irish International Driver of the Year and former Irish Young Driver of the Year touched down on Italian soil on Sunday for the next stage of his rally career. Devine took part in the Junior World Rally Championship in  and last season finished third in a stage of the European Championship in Hungary in the same Hyundai i R car he will be behind the wheel of this weekend. After Tuesdays testing day, Devine and co-driver Brian Hoy, spent Wednesday and Thursday carrying out recce of the course and making notes ahead of Fridays shake-down. googletag.cmd.push The event properly gets underway on Saturday which will see Callum and Brian tackle six stages before a further nine stages on Sunday conclude the event which spans just under km. “A lot of effort has been put in by Motorsport Ireland and the Rally Academy to making sure I was here,” Devine told the County Derry Post. “There is the support of Hyundai for me to make a championship assault, so there there is a lot of support being put into it. “It is a big step and I would say it is the biggest year for us. It is going to be our first year and we will be on the back foot. A lot of the drivers we are competing against are in their second or third season and have done this rally a few times.” googletag.cmd.push While Devine sees it as a learning year he realises the need to perform and has set his target to in the Junior R category. “The way it has always worked out in years before,you are fast enough in the juniors you are never that far away from the overall podium. “Chris Ingram, last year, was planning on winning the junior championship and he got beat on it by . of a second in the Czech Republic, he lost the junior championship but he went on to win the full European Championship.” Devine speaks of how the European Championship has lost a lot of momentum to the World Championship, but with Covid- forcing the cancellation of other events it will bring all the big hitters to Italy this weekend. “Craigand a lot of the guys who have been here before, there are lot of quick guys that are going to be going for the main championship. It was probably the strongest year in the European Championship for the last five or six years. There are a lot of quick drivers, but thats what you want,” Devine said. During his World Rally debut in , the Park man had two fourth places and a fth place finish. “We were second in Portugal and we had a DNF . In Corsica, we clipped a back wheel and went down, we were heading for the podium there,” he recalls. “It was one of those years, it didnt click for us. It was a big step, you learn a lot from it. At the time, there wasnt much support and you were left jumping into the unknown into the WRC and how much is involved in it outside of driving of the car, that was the biggest shock but at the same time we enjoyed it. “It was a challenging year and we are now back on the Europeanand are where we want to be.We want to race abroad and see how fast we can be.” Being named International Driver of the Year last season was a big shock for Devine, given the field of drivers in the hunt for the title. Apart from a gravel rally in Fivemiletown earlier this year, the sporting lockdown forced Callum into a dferent type of training. “I have been keeping fit, I got a bike,” he jokes. “I did a bit of running, I was in the forest and bought the bike and doing prep watching on-boards from the rallies and keeping myself fit and active.” He pays tribute to Motorsport Ireland and in particular John Coyne for getting another chance to dine at the top table. “He lives over in the Statesbut he is a great of Irish rallying. They have gave me a lot of help andit wasnt for them, I wouldnt be here.” For Devine, in his usual laid back conservation, its time to steer his way towards a podium spot.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The Department of Health which operates the local test centre and several others in Northern Ireland confirmed that the local testing centre will no longer be available for testing from the end of July. A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The testing site at City of Derry Rugby Club will no longer be available for testing from the end of July. googletag.cmd.push “Work is underway on behalf of the National Testing Programme to identy an alternative site and an announcement will be made in due course. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. googletag.cmd.push It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Coronavirus pandemic has been tough on local businesses and news that Eason closed in Foyleside came as a blow to the city centre. There are however independent businesses who despite the current economic uncertainty are branching out and creating employment in the city. Much loved food truck and eatery Pyke ‘N’ Pommes revealed on social media that it is about to take over a new unit – at the old Primrose cafeacute on the Strand Road. googletag.cmd.push An exciting new project, BROslashN, has also been announced at recently vacated premises on Bishop Street which will house a coffee bar, barista school, restaurant and cocktail bar with locally sourced beer and spirits. Daragh McCauley is the owner of ine Hostages Coffee Company which is based at the top of Waterloo Street. He will run the new venture with business partner Connor Allen who has been manager at Harry’s Shack in Portstewart since it opened. ine Hostages started as a coffee van on the side of the road in Donegal before they opened the shop in Derry towards the end of . googletag.cmd.push “My dream was always to open a coffee shop,” Mr McCauley said. A refined menu at ine Hostages consists of grilled cheese toasties with a choice of good quality local meats and homemade ingredients as well as the best quality bread and baked goods. It was ‘slow going’ at the beginning but the pandemic came as a blow as the business was beginning to gain some traction. With a one-way system in operation they were able to successfully reopen once permission was granted. Mr McCauley believes the quality of coffee sourced from Bailies Coffee Roasters is second to none The most important ingredient is the ‘passion’  Hostages has for all of their products, he added. Anyone using Bailies products in the North West of the country will now be trained at the new Bishop Street premises. BROslashN will offer coffee and food throughout the day and sit-down meals in the evening complemented by craft beers and cocktails. They intend to support local as much as possible through suppliers and employing staff from the North West. “I’ve been working in coffee now for about four and a half years, I’m going to stay managing this shop but will work in BROslashN as well,” Mr McCauley explained. “We’re going to try and create as many jobs as we possibly can. About  people across both businesses. “The barista school will be opened upstairs on Bishop Street. “We’re hoping to open around August  and we’ll know this week whether that’s going to happen. “We’ve a lot of staff hired but are still looking for people with experience.” Mr McCauley said he feels confident opening the new business in the current climate because the people of Derry have done a good job of looking after each other and businesses have been sensible. “Derry has been really, really good so far and the way we will lay the shop out on Bishop Street it held about  people but we’ll be dropping it to  and the tables will be spaced out without losing the atmosphere. “It will be a cosy but modern shop and unless there was a complete lockdown again we’d be very confident with the way we have it laid out that it will work.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Father La rises in the morning at around .am for early morning Mass. Less than an hour later, he is under an open sky as birds fly overhead undertaking the Stations in his bare feet leaving solitary footprints where before many soles left their imprint on the earth. Housemartins A station takes around an hour and ten minutes to do and Father La does so under the swooping wings of the Housemartins amidst a backdrop of blooming nature during these calm but drizzly mornings. googletag.cmd.push At am, the boatmen come onto the island. Each day Thomas Gallagher from Ballyshannon, Reece McGrath from Pettigo and Joe Sheeran from Mountcharles arrive on the island and undertake their own work. They leave at pm. “Really, I can hardly remember the last time in my le I was lonely. I am at ease with my own company,” he said. As they leave the island, Father La is well into his day. “I would be hard pushed to find a time when I have been busier. “People are afraid that I am bored but I’m not. The team are exceptionally busy, they have been putting so much work into alternative ways to keep in touch with pilgrims. We have set ourselves to be in outreach mode,” he said. googletag.cmd.push In the evening, Father La goes up to the Basilica for night prayer. “My thoughts are to honour the rhythm of the pilgrimage season,” he says. This year, those affiliated with the island are busy in new and alternate ways. Father La said that many people have been sending petitions to those on the island: “We get a lot of people who send us petitions asking for prayer for this or that,” Father La said. In his prayers, he remains faithful to those people and the heartfelt petitions that they have undertaken to write and to send to the island. Virtuous pilgrimage On the last weekend in June, Father La invited people to do the full pilgrimage with him from wherever they were. It was not a virtual pilgrimage, he said, but a virtuous one and people did fast and pray asthey were on the island. People signed up online to participate. Father La recalls that the pilgrimage was one where they were not blessed with favourable weather. “The rain was horizontal. It was driving rain and constant wind. “It was relentless during the night. On Saturday we got through reasonably well,” he said. Those who participated were bestowed with a certicate which carries the Lough Derg seal and are signed by the prior. All of the certicates had to be sent out by the team to those who participated. A pilgrimage season did not take place on the island in  as result of a dispute with boatmen. However, many more pilgrims came to the island the following year. Pilgrimage path There is now a newly refurbished path on the lake shore of Lough Derg. The path which was recently relaunched would have been used by pilgrims in the medieval times. In the s pilgrims from as far away as Spain, Italy and Hungary used part of this trail as they made their way to what medieval Europe knew of as St Patrick’s Purgatory. Work was being carried out on the path before the pandemic struck and six new boards were designed and ready to go when the lockdown came into effect. There are now six display boards which bring to le the story of the Pilgrim Path and those who walk the path can enjoy stopping to read the boards. Father La said that the ‘full walk’ is around k along the shore road and to Saints Island. “We went to the point where pilgrims used to cross to Saint’s Monastery where they were given hospitality before being brought to Station Island,” he said. People can also take a shorter loop and everyone can do the walk at their own pace. Some people like to do it in soft contemplation and reflection whilst other people like to absorb the surroundings. Many people enjoy taking photographs in the historic and picturesque surroundings. “I led two guided groups on Saturday and Sunday,” he said. Numbers were limited as a result of the Covid- church and State guidelines, those who took part enjoyed it. One-day retreat Father La said that it remains to be seen whether a one-day retreat will take place on the island this year. “It remains to be seen whether we can open for a one-day retreat at this time,” he said. However, a meeting for the matter to be discussed will take place before the end of the week. August  It is expected that Father La will remain on the island until August . Enjoying his own company, reflection and prayer, Father La seems content during this year’s traditional pilgrimage time. He has now become familiar with a goose who comes onto the island to graze in the grass. The goose can be found behind St Mary’s, at times, and when startled will take off honking at great speeds, at times. His presence is one that the reflective priest appreciates. “I am kind of glad for his company. “It is amazing the company that God sends you when you are on your own,” he fondly says.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lavey won the minor football and hurling double last season, but due to the young age profile of the team only minor football skipper Cormac Collins and Ryan McGill have graduated to the senior ranks. googletag.cmd.push He acknowledges the work going on around the club, referencing the U success and a useful U group. “From my point of view, I wish they would come through a bit quicker,” McGarvey jokes. While this weekends opponents have been busy with challenge games, Lavey had just Sundays draw with Carrickmore to help their championship preparation. “Thats all we are going to take,” the Lavey boss stressed, rolling out the names of the dual players in his plans. Fintan Bradley, Dara McPeake, Aidan Toner, the McGill brothers , Liam and Colm Murphy. “I envisage  of our team will be dual players. They wont all start on the football team, but they are aiming to play both,” predicts McGarvey, who leads the management team of Simon Wilson, Ben Dodds, Adie McGill and Mark Hearty. googletag.cmd.push “You are not going to know until you start playing. The boys were glad to get out, but we have a tough schedule because nearly all our players are dual players. We were going four or five times a week and we had to cut it back on them.” On the other side of the coin, Dee Doherty is back in charge of Na Magha, eight years after helping them to an Ulster final where they went down to Bredagh. Galway native Tomaacutes Lally, who has transferred from London club St Gabriels, joins him on the management team. “We are trying to build, like other clubs and counties are doing, to try and progress,” said Doherty, who knows the hurling scene well in his role as physio with Derry senior hurlers. “We want to rise up from being Na Magha, the junior team in Derry. It is a game we are looking forward to, with the incentive of it being your first game at home. We know it is Lavey and we know what we are up against.” It will be a chastening experience for his young side, with many of them going straight in against senior clubs in their first year of adult hurling. Many of his squad work in the retail sector, so balancing shts around training has proved dficult. In a  or  day spell Doherty has juggled challenge games with Donegal sides Burt, St Eunans, Setanta and Buncrana. “We have not been able to get the same team out for any of the games,” said Doherty, who was happy to be working with a group of  plus players. “Of that, nine are first year minors and cant play, but we are thinking down the line to next year and the year after. I have never saw numbers like that at Na Magha in my le,” he said. Having their own base is important, but Doherty points to the efforts of Ciaran McCarron and the coaches who have nurtured the upcoming minor squad. “There is a good group of players there that are interested in playing. You are trying to mix them with the older boys. We want to progress into the intermediate level, thats the aim. “For us to win anything this year, we are going to have to beat one of the senior clubs in the county. If we could win one championship game this year, it would be a result for us and that is the target we set out for ourselves.” It will be a long-term project and continuity will be the key. Home advantage will give Na Magha a familiar surrounding, but Lavey should head back down the Glenshane pass with the points. VERDICT: Lavey RELATED- Sean Leos masterclass not enough to clinch Coleraine win.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, where Limavady is situated, experienced the largest surge in cases, with an extra  since last Wednesday. A mobile testing unit, situated on the Greystone Road, was deployed to the area in response to the cluster. Only one more case was recorded in the Mid Ulster area, but Derry and Strabane saw fourteen new cases, bringing its total to . Ten local GAA clubs suspended activities as a precautionary measure in response to the cluster, with only St Mary’s GAC, Banagher, confirming a positive case within their members. googletag.cmd.push A club spokesperson said: “All relevant people have been contacted and the Public Health Agency will contact any club memberthey feel there is a concern. “We will keep you up to date of any information received from them. “The GAA has advised the club to continue as normal, although we have decided to cancel all underage training until further notice.” A shop in Claudy, part of the Derry and Strabane district, has also confirmed a member of its staff is currently in isolation after testing positive for Covid-. In a statement, posted online, Centra Claudy said other members of staff have volunteered for testing. googletag.cmd.push “Whilst we do have one staff member who has tested positive for Covid- they are in isolation since they had the test and are following public health advice,” they said. “The public health authority did not contact any of our other staff for testing via track  trace although some have volunteered for testing and all results to date have ed negative. “We can assure you that we have been following very strict Covid guidelines since we entered this pandemic in March. “Our staff have worked tirelessly to provide a service for the local area, and we have appreciated the support  patience from our community in following guidelines when shopping.” A ‘local lockdown’ have been enforced in Leicester, England, after a surge in positive cases, and the Department of Health said the strategy would be ‘considered’ in Northern Ireland. “With lockdown restrictions being eased it is likely that we will see clusters and outbreaks of Covid-,” a DoH spokesperson said. “In circumstances where the number of cases continues to increase a range of measures will be considered, including the introduction of local lockdownsnecessary and depending on the circumstances as they arise.” Sinn Feacutein MLA Caoimhe Archibald. East Derry MLA, Caoimhe Archibald, has urged people not to panic, saying the figures were proof the Test, Trace and Protect system was working. “It is concerning that a cluster has been identied, first and foremost for those iniduals who are affected,” she said. “Hopefully no one is suffering from serious symptoms and will recover quickly, but there is a general concern there in the local community and that’s understandable. “We don’t want people to be alarmed. We have seen the test, trace and isolate system in place, and we can see how that is working. “The cases have been identied and the process is rolling out. That is critical to containing the virus and we see those procedures working effectively. “It’s a timely reminder to us all that we can’t become complacent, that we do need to remain vigilant and practise public health guidance in terms of social distancing, good hygiene and cough etiquette.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One Big Field Party is being held this Sunday on a large green area beside Creggans Linsfort Drive. The event is free to attend, but donations will be collected for local musicians who have performed for free throughout lockdown to raise money for local charities and people in need.

Some people have said to us that there have been a few reported cases of coronavirus recently andthat spike continues we will cancel the event. But at the minute we are taking every precaution to make sure everyone is safe, including using  security staff and a team of litter pickers, Mr Gallagher asked those attending the concert to observe social distancing rules. googletag.cmd.push We want people to come and to have a good time but we would ask that they abide by the rules. We are only here to entertain. If everyone does as the security people ask then everyone can have a good time. Lockdown has proved very challenging for Derrys entertainment community, with many losing all their income overnight. I would say about % of the musicians I know do it as their full time job and they lost everything, said Mr Gallagher. Many of those that were eligible for government support got so little that it was hardly worth their while. Despite this, they continued to gig online to keep peoples spirits up and raise money for charity. We hosted street parties across the city that made a really big dference to people in those areas. There was one wee woman of  who stood at her window crying and waving out because she was so happy and then she sent her son out with a donation of pound.

A spokesperson for the club confirmed the news last night after a day of uncertainly regarding the potential fixture. Originally scheduled to face League of Ireland champions Dundalk, Celtic were expecting to welcome the Lilywhites to Celtic Park, but quarantine restrictions ended their hopes of playing the game with anyone coming into the Republic from the UK having to self isolate for  days. With the League of Ireland set to start next Friday, that would have been impossible for the champions. googletag.cmd.push That opened the door for Derry City to step into the glamour friendly, with reports suggesting that former Celtic and City star Paddy McCourt was heavily involved in organising the game. The hope was that, as Derry City would only be travelling to another part of the UK from Northern Ireland, they are not bound by the same restrictions. That hope continued into yesterday, with the club hoping to finalise arrangements for the game, but they were dashed by the FAI last night. With City set to travel to Dublin to face St. Patricks Athletic, just eight days after the proposed game in Scotland, the same -day rule which scuppered Dundalks plans, also appear to have stopped Derry, despite technically being in the UK. googletag.cmd.push Instead of Celtic, City hope to finalise their pre-season plans with a game against Northwest neighbours Finn Harps behind closed doors at the Brandywell tomorrow night. Declan Devines men faced Cltonville in midweek and drew -, with the City boss running his eye over three new trialists. The Candystyripes face Sligo Rovers in the resumption of the league season next Friday. Celtic, meanwhile, who now wont have Irish opposition this weekend, finished off their mini tour of France with a - defeat at French giants Paris St-German, with superstars Kylian Mbappe and Neymar both on the scoresheet in the Parc des Princes encounter.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Fortunately, a fire, believed to have spread to undergrowth after an attempt was made to set a speed restriction sign alight, did not develop into a large blaze.The volunteers who run the railway mdash who have launched an urgent appeal to raise pound, mdash are particularly concerned about an attempt to force open the main gates they discovered empty beer cans. First aid boxes at the station were also raided for bandages.Damage at the Loop  was discovered during a recent shunt to test rolling stock and carry out essential track maintenance, with the exercise taking place while visitors were banned from the railway due to lockdown restrictions.Railway officials have reported the incidents to police and have appealed to anyone who can assist officers with their enquiries to come forward.The recent incidents come after the coronavirus lockdown had a massive hit on the railwayrsquos finances.In an online post, officials appealed to young people to ldquoleavethem alone and stop trying to destroy the place, also asking parents do they know where their children are and what they are doing.The hard-working volunteers say they have enough on their plate without having to ldquosort out other peoplersquos mess, expressing concern about people walking along the railway lines which they are not allowed to do.Officials say the ldquostupidity of others is the reason why they hope the local community will support their fundraising appeal to help pay for better security as a bid for financial help from the Northern Ireland Executive proved unsuccessful.A recent bid for support from the Department of Communitiesrsquo Covid- Charities Fund to cover costs racked up to maintain the business which has been mothballed due to lockdown restrictions was unsuccessful.Officials fear that the railway will also miss out on securing a slice of a poundm fund for business start-ups and tourist attraction investment which was announced recently.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner recently wrote an open letter highlighting the railwayrsquos plight and its reluctance to ask for help in the current financial climate.He said coronavirus restrictions have had a ldquodevastating impact on the railwayrsquos operations and its restoration work.Mr Gardiner said the railway was likely to remain closed for the remainder of the year due to the restrictions around Covid-.He said that with no income for the rest of the year, the railway faced ldquomajor challenges.Mr Gardiner said given that the railwayrsquos final attempts at securing Covid- support funding from Stormont failed, it had reluctantly turned to its members and supporters to ask for help.He added: ldquoWe need to raise at least pound, this year just to keep the railway in a good condition and make some progress with essential projects.To date, the railwayrsquos appeal has raised pound,, with anyone interested in making a donation asked to visit www.facebook donate   or text RAIL plus the amount to  or visit www.downrail appeal.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Aarin’s lockdown farm project  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK boy has been enjoying lsquoThe Good Lersquo during the Covid- lockdown.Twelve year-old Aarin Rea has spent the past four months developing a miniature farm, complete with chickens, ducks, doves and even peacocks, in the garden of his Knochnashinna home.Hersquos also growing fruit and vegetables in his allotment and specially built greenhouse, and hersquos also planted apple trees.His family and neighbours will soon be able to share in an abundance of potatoes, cabbages, lettuces, carrots, scallions, broad beans, tomatoes, strawberries and apples, as well as a supply of fresh eggs.Aarinrsquos mum, Karin, says the miniature farm has helped bring the community together during the isolation of lockdown and has lted everyonersquos spirits.ldquoItrsquos all everyone has been talking about lately, she said. ldquoThey are always enquiring as to how the farm is coming along and Aarin couldnrsquot be any prouder at whathe has achieved over the last few months.ldquoAarin has been eager to get out every day to his little farm while he has been off school. He spent the good weather tending and watering his fruit vegetables both in the allotment and in the greenhouse, which his father, Anthony, built for him.Aarin is the proud owner of peacock chicks, which were hatched thanks to a tip from his grandfather, Leslie Rea, who told him to put golf balls underneath the peacocks to encourage them to lay eggs.Aarin, has since given his poultry flock some pretty ingenious names, and he now considers his ducks, James Pond and Quacky Chan, among some of his best friends.Then there are his favourite hens, Henner Lopez, Princess Laya and Fluffy, who are very happy to the strutting around.The newest arrivals are two doves, Holy and Spirit, which are housed in a newly-built dovecote and a turkey chick.However, Aarinrsquos favourite animal is his beloved Jack Russell, Lottie.Aarinrsquos farming skills have come a long way since be began growing potatoes in tubs.ldquoI sell my duck eggs to elderly neighbours who adore their distinct flavour. Our next door neighbour, Tommy Armour, is always giving me little bits of advice to help bring the brood along. Recently, it seems to be turning out to more of a community effort to be honest, he said.ldquoAt the beginning of lockdown I missed all my friends, but the farm helped keep me busy.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be a great lover of completing schoolwork at home. I much prefer spending my time tending to my fruit and vegetables and caring for my new chicks.ldquoSometime my little sister, Grace, helps me. She is nine years old and is learning a lot more about farming than I ever thought she would.Aarin added: ldquoI thought the good weather during lockdown helped my vegetables grow.

That is absolutely essential.Campaigners added: ldquoThe historic underinvestment in the Ambulance Service has been widely known for years.

Sadly, for what is normally family day at the track, there were even less people in the enclosures than at the Ulster National meeting in March.Despite the recent dry spell and uncertainty about the resumption, the track was in tip top condition, so well done ground staff.Down Royal have an all-flat meeting this Friday, also behind closed doors.I was saddened recently to learn of the passing of David Armstrong of Saintfield.David was a long time supporter of local point-to-points, as an owner etc, and many will recall his late daughter, Yvonne, riding under her maiden name and her married name of Heaney.

If there had have been, the guide would have stopped and taken him down.Jules was later told by the Matterhorn Museum that itrsquos believed he was the youngest person ever to have mastered the peak.Chris, now living with his family in the Scottish Highlands where he and his we Mignonne run a gin distillery, Daffyrsquos, said: ldquoJules has always loved climbing since he was able to walk. Whether it was trees or rocks, he progressed doing indoor climbing walls and roped up climbing outdoors.A former professional snowboarder, Chris grew up on Sketrick Island, near Killinchy, with his parents, Zora and Paul.He developed a love of mountains and climbing as a child in the Mournes and through his schoolrsquos mountaineering club, so it was inevitable he would pass on his passion for the outdoors to Jules and his elder brother,  year-old Louis.ldquoWersquove always climbed as a family but several years ago Jules was asked to do a school project on any subject and he chose to do one on climbing the Matterhorn, explained Chris.ldquoOne day he asked mehe could climb the Matterhorn some time and I said of course, rather thinking it was a joke.ldquoBut Jules really put in the training himself and kept pushing me to take on a hike or a climb. He was always very capable as we have always climbed as a family.Chris said that Jules continued to put the work into building up his skills and stamina for the climb mdash even the Covid- could not defeat the  year-oldrsquos determination to climb the mountain.ldquoWe had lined up an American friend of ours to guide us, but he couldnrsquot travel due to the pandemic so we thought we would go with the local mountain guides.ldquoHowever, they told Jules that he couldnrsquot do it until he was  and after he proved himself. We did a lot of high altitude extreme rock climbs. They watched Jules, saw that he was very capable and decided to give him a shot.While Chris was prepared to try and make his sonrsquos ambition to come true, even he was surprised when they safely made the summit and ed back down without incident.ldquoI donrsquot think I fully expected we would make it to the top, admitted Chris. ldquoJules gave me a hug at the very top and said he couldnrsquot believe he had done it. He thought it was incredible but it did take a while for it to sink in afterwards.While Jules may be eligible for an entry into the Guinness Book of Records, his dad said that accolade is not what Jules was about.ldquoHersquos not a glory hunter in any sense, hersquos just appreciative and proud to have done it.

However, the claims have been firmly rejected by local people keen to see the controversial plan aborted.According to the tender documents, CIL wants to replace the existing beam with a more environmentally friendly LED light, maintaining that it can do this while retaining the traditional lens.And CIL says while mercury has been used to rotate large revolving Fresnel lenses since the s, with the system providing a near frictionless environment, it describes mercury as a ldquotoxic substance.While pointing to many years of reliable service, the organisation says there is increasing European and international legislation restricting the use, storage and transport of mercury.CIL maintains while it has no immediate statutory requirement to remove mercury from lighthouses, it has been its policy that where re-engineering capital projects are being carried out at lighthouses, ldquothe opportunity is taken to remove mercury.The organisation says with no other liquid medium available to replace mercury, alternative solutions are designed on a station by station basis to provide visual aid to navigation.CIL claims that trials on an alternative bearing at Tory Island lighthouse which started in  ensures the reliability of the bearing solution proposed for St Johnrsquos Point where it plans to retain the existing Fresnel lens which it recognises as important to the heritage of the station and local area.ldquoAs part of the engineering upgrade works, the mercury will be removed from existing optic installations and will be replaced by a mechanical bearing to provide an alternative rotation mechanism, states the tender documentation. ldquoOnly the liquid mercury will be removed and the remaining apparatus will be retained unchanged.ldquoIt is the intention to award the contracts for mercury removal at Rathlin East and Rathlin West lighthouses initially and appoint the successful tenderer for future removals.A spokeswoman for the Lecale Lightkeepers campaign group battling to retain the lighthouse in its current guise, suggested that local politicians will be ldquoperplexed that CIL has effectively ignored their wishes on the issue and the protection of the iconic sweeping beam.She said Newry, Mourne and Down Council unanimously decided to oppose any changes and was firmly standing alongside the local community on the issue.ldquoThe people and politicians are as one on this issue, the spokeswoman declared. ldquoSt Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is part of the arearsquos unique maritime history and heritage and must not be changed in any way.ldquoWhy is CIL issuing tender documentation when it has not told local politicians and indeed the people of Killough why it is proceeding without further discussion with them  Why is CIL ignoring the wishes of elected representatives She continued: ldquoWe have consistently asked for this beautul lighthouse to be simply left as it is. It is working perfectly andit isnrsquot broke, donrsquot fix it. We have consistently argued that the mercury issue is a red herring and nothing we have seen or heard has made us deviate from this position.ldquoSt Johnrsquos is one of the best ventilated lighthouses of its kind and we are opposed to any orce from the current Fresnel lens and its Burdel rotating mechanism.Campaigners say they hope that politicians will seek an urgent, virtual meeting with CIL to ask why their wishes have been ignored and why they were not formally told that the tendering process had begun.The campaign spokeswoman added: ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse boasts what is widely regarded as a rare bit of engineering excellence which we want retained and maintained. The iconic sweeping beam and rotation system must not be lost at the stroke of a pen and consigned to the pages of history.

Now things have changed signicantly and the hard work of many people, including local MPs, MLAs, councillors and roads officials have paid off, he said.ldquoThere have been many  dawns over the years but we are now at the stage that work could start within a year which is good news. It is a great pity that Vincent is not here to see this happening.For a number of years, Mr Casement and Mr Fullam were the sole flag-bearers for the bypass, ensuring that the project was firmly in the public eye.While the scheme was making slow progress, the regeneration officials refused to concede defeat and organised a number of meetings, inviting business representatives from across South Down. They recognised that the construction of the bypass was as crucially important for hauliers north of Ballynahinch as it was for those as far south as Kilkeel as their lorries were often caught up in traffic hold-ups on the main approaches to and from Ballynahinch.ldquoThe support for the bypass from all quarters was overwhelming, continued Mr Casement.ldquoI have lost count of the number of locally elected and direct rule ministers who came to Ballynahinch to learn more about the bypass. Confirmation that it is now tantalisingly close proves that you must never give up, just keep chipping away and stating your case.The former regeneration official also recalled a suggestion to construct the bypass and recoup the money spent on building it by charging drivers to use it.He said while there were some opposed to the idea, a number of leading hauliers were in favour as it would save them not only time, but fuel costs as lorries would not be sitting in traffic burning diesel.ldquoIt has been a long haul to get to this point and so many people have worked hard on this project. Successive isional roads managers were in favour of the bypass but there was never the money to work on its finer detail and move it to the shovel-ready stage, explained Mr Casement. ldquoThat position subsequently changed and the scheme has now reached a pivotal point.While the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, Mr Casement said the scheme brings with it a number of benefits.ldquoReducing tailbacks will help the environment and perhaps one of the most important aspects of the bypass is that will deter drivers from using a number of heavily populated housing areas as unofficial bypasses, including the Loughside, Carlisle Park and Langley Road areas, he continued.ldquoThe bypass can hopefully kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre, encouraging new retailers and more shoppers. I believe that the current congestion can deter people who decide to shop where.Mr Casement said the proposed bypass can also benefit the wider South Down area as visitors from Belfast will be able to avoid Ballynahinch town centre.ldquoBallynahinch is regarded as the gateway to the Mournes and that position will be firmly cemented when the new link road opens. The scheme has never been this close in my letime and I hope that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on the ground.ldquoBallynahinch residents and the townrsquos business community deserve this scheme. It is decades overdue and when it was confirmed recently that the project is well placed on the list of priority government schemes I was delighted.ldquoBut I was conscious that my good friend Vincent was not here to enjoy a moment that he had dedicated a large part of his le to achieving.With all eyes now on the Department for Infrastructure to confirm a bypass start date, Mr Casement hopes that it will be soon.ldquoIt has taken signicantly longer to reach this point than any of us ever imagined, but we have made it, added Mr Casement. ldquoThe icing on the cake will be confirmation of a start date and people are eagerly awaiting this announcement..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Newcastle Lions Club members celebrate 100 years’ service  ","story":"THREE members of Newcastle Lions Club have received longstanding service awards after clocking more than  years of service between them.Club president Marian McGreevy hosted a socially distanced event last Thursday to celebrate the hard-working lions.Some  years ago Michael Niblett and Peter May, along with a host of others in Newcastle, began the Newcastle Lions Club.

This particular facility could also be bulldozed as part of an ambitious redevelopment proposal.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is preparing to press head with investigative work at the prime Central Promenade location mdash including bore hole tests mdash to gather as much information as possible before it presses ahead with a multi-million pound investment.Council officials say that they recognise the need for modern leisure and community facilities at the site of the Newcastle Centre with several options on the table.They include a complete rebuild which include an extension to the existing centre, a complete refurbishment of the complex or partial rebuild and partial refurbishment.Retaining the Tropicana pool would restrict redevelopment proposals and the outdoor facility is most likely to be demolished, with enhanced car parking also set to be a key plank of any new proposal, in tandem with signicant disabled access improvements.A detailed feasibility study looked at a number of potential locations for a new leisure and community facility in the resort, with the Newcastle Centre site emerging as the firm favourite to house the new facility.Council officials say they are looking at a number of possibilities and that ldquoall options for the redevelopment of the town centre site are on the table.The existing Newcastle Centre forms part of the historic Annesley Buildings which enjoys protected status, but itrsquos believed that the cost of redeveloping the property and replacing the old extension at the rear would be signicant.It is also believed that an added problem facing the council is that the size of the existing centrersquos rooms are too small and unsuitable for modern needs. One possibility is that the facade of the current building would be retained, with a new-build at the rear.Council officials say that any plan to redevelop the Central Promenade site will not impact on any part of the promenade at the rear of the building.They insist that they are committed to the Newcastle project and recognise that it has a key role to play, meeting the needs of local people and visitors alike, particularly during inclement weather.It has also been confirmed that local people are to be asked for their views on redeveloping the site as part of a pre-planning application process, to come up with a favourable design.Senior council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.

Much better first to upgrade the A east of Stranraer. Above is a part of the road that was upgraded to bypass the village of Dunragit, but the overwhelming bulk of the -mile road to England is single carriageway, in which traffic can get stuck behind tractorsIt was mid - financial slump, and all sorts of businesses were struggling. Private transport services were being cut.My concern was that the PO fast ferry from Larne to Cairnryan, which had just begun for the  summer season, might not survive.It needed support, I wrote. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Sure enough, within years the fast ferry was withdrawn .Axing the Larne-Cairnryan fast boat was a sad milestone in the history of movement on these islands.It was the fastest passenger sea link that has ever existed between Ireland and Great Britain, making the journey in an hour. Even the Belfast-Stranraer Seacat express of the s took  minutes.Travel does not always get faster as history progresses. After the Roman empire collapsed, roads in Europe decayed.When Concorde stopped flying in , the public could no longer make transatlantic crossings on passenger planes in just four hours. And since PO ceased running the fast ferry, it has not been possible to cross the Irish Sea or North Channel in one hour on any scheduled, car-carrying vessel. It might never be possible again.This is all the more disappointing given that there is now dual carriageway or motorway the whole distance from Belfast to Larne.The road was upgraded because it forms part of European E route, from Larne to Rosslare. In fact, most of the road between those two ports is now motorway or high quality dual. Yet the ports themselves have lost key ferry services.This is all relevant now because Boris Johnson has approved a feasibility study into his idea of a bridge from Northern Ireland to Scotland.The idea has many critics, who describe it as a fantasy, yet engineers have said it can be built.But last year there was surprise, even scoffing, when I predicted on a radio discussion show that it would not happen for  years at the very earliest.Some people alive today might see such a structure, but that is mainly because children in  might live into the  century.There are longer bridges in the world than the  miles from Donaghadee to Portpatrick but none passes over a , foot trench.So it would be the most impressive bridge in the world. If any country can build it, the UK, which was once an infrastructure pioneer, and which is the world’s sixth richest nation, can.The problem is that traffic between NI and Scotland is minuscule by international standards.In summer  I passed through the Channel Tunnel, months after it opened, and remember the passenger excitement as our train went from Kent countryside into the tunnel, then emerged into French daylight. That massive triumph of engineering was the culmination of  years of plans for a physical link between England and France.It also connected two cities of almost  million people each, London-Paris, on one of the world’s busiest corridors. NI-Scotland is nowhere near such numbers.A bridge would be doing well to get , vehicles a day paying £ each per crossing, and even then the £+ million annual revenue might only cover the immense security and upkeep costs, let alone giveon the multi billion pound outlay cost.The short-term feasibility of a bridge is akin to unrealistic calls for high speed rail from Belfast to Londonderry, cities of , and , respectively.Not even France, with the best rail infrastructure in the world, has high speed link between two far bigger cities that I have often visited, Bordeaux-Toulouse, which are a mere  miles apart with a combined population of  million.It is unfair to dismiss a bridge to Scotland as a fantasy, better to label it as a distant dream.It cannot be, as Mr Johnson hopes, a boost to the Union because we can’t be sure of the exact constitutional make-up of these islands many decades into the future.As a letter writer says opposite , there are less costly infrastructure projects we need to do first such as improve the road from Stranrarer Cairnryan toM English border.Even that is a hugely expensive project for a road with low traffic levels. But parts of it, such a busier -mile section east of Dumfries, could plausibly be dualled.The value of such an upgrade is evident in an alternative road route to England, the A from Holyhead to the Welsh mainland. I have driven Belfast-London many times since the s and have seen how the best route has changed from being via Stranraer to via Holyhead.This is due to there now being a motorway to Dublin, including a tunnel that goes direct to the port. Then there is dual carriageway or motorway in Wales, so you no longer get stuck behind tractors in Anglesey, as you still do in Galloway.Theof a one-hour fast ferry from Larne to Cairnryan and the upgrade of much of the A would radically improve our links to Scotland and be many, many times cheaper than a bridge.Mr Johnson must know that the Union faces real political threats. One of the dangers right now is the rise in Scottish nationalism.In Northern Ireland, unionists face structural disadvantages.For example, mandatory coalition at Stormont facilitates republicans who want NI to fail. Politicians who are less hostile to the status quo tend to want to maintain their seats and livelihoods. Naturally they are inclined to appease the radicals.London should also try to balance a situation in which Dublin officials echo nationalist demands while the UK keeps sending us uninformed secretaries of state, who are influenced by an NIO that is, at best, neutral on unionism.These are urgent problems for the Union. Vague support for a possible future bridge is irrelevant to those challenges.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Letter: Scottish and UK governments have failed to upgrade the roads from Cairnyan——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The party made constraints on ministers one of its centre-piece demands for the restoration of Stormont, yet now, under a dferent leadership, it is helping to push through legislation that will remove those constraintsThis bill, which has been rushed through the assembly in a matter of weeks and has to date received little or no legislative scrutiny, will fundamentally affect decision-making in Northern Ireland.From the public comment on the bill, there is no appreciation of the implications of some of the proposed changes. Instead,MLAs are sleepwalking into making profound constitutional amendments. Twenty years ago ministers enjoyed considerable autonomy in relation to decisions within their department and famously the then minister for education abolished the eleven plus exam on his last day in office without recourse to the executive.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Richard Bullick, a former barrister, was special advisor to Peter Robinson and Arlene Foster as first ministerAllowing ministers such power within their departmental remits did not sit well with democratic accountability or joined up government and the DUP made the reform of these arrangements a centre-piece of its terms for the restoration of devolution. Admittedly, there was also a signicant element of being able to limit the capacity of Sinn Fein ministers to pursue their political and constitutional agenda. In a  policy document, the party argued that legislation “would be required to ensure that ultimate power would rest with the executive as opposed to the inidual departments”. To be clear the DUP’s intention was to ensure that any important decision could be required to secure executive approval and the resulting provisions meant that unionistconsent was required. The provisions that were legislated for were complex and interlocking. The underlying objective was achieved in two carefully worded statutory tests for which decisions would require executive approval. These arrangements operated successfully from  and on only a few occasions did DUP ministers feel compelled to go to court to successfully enforce the arrangements the party had largely devised. The rationale for the present bill arises out of a Court of Appeal decision to the effect that a signicant planning application required executive approval. Understandably, the executive wished to bring forward an amendment to recty that situation, but more controversially it has also chosen to amend a provision relating the carefully calibrated tests for executive approval more generally. There is little evidence that the drafters of the objectionable clauses of the bill were informed of the purpose of the original provisions. As a result the proposed changes seriously undermine the DUP’s claim to have a veto on all important decisions in NI. The essential purpose of the amendment is to redefine a test for full executive consideration in a way which would increase ministerial autonomy. This was done by limiting the meaning of what constitutes a ‘cross-cutting’ matter, reducing the range of decisions that have to come to the executive. Why then are DUP the appearing to be reversing a long-standing policy  My view is that it is not a change of policy but flows from misconceptions in what is a complex area of law.Firstly, there is a custom and practice argument which asserts that the new clause reflects the sort of matters that actually come before the executive for decision. While this may be true, it also entirely misses the point. The real issue is not what normally comes to the executive, but what can be required to come where other ministers take exception to a proposed decision.Secondly, there is the argument that the legislation restores the test for what constitutes cross-cutting to the standard which existed before the Buick decision , but after the changes brought about by the  St Andrews Agreement. The new test for cross-cutting would mean that there would be no requirement for executive agreement, “unless that matter affects the exercise of the statutory responsibilities of one or more other ministers more than incidentally”. Notably, there is no mention of ‘statutory’ responsibilities in paragraph  of the Belfast Agreement. This distinction has signicant application for s where there is no statutory underpinning for what departments do in practice. Even more signicantly the “more than incidentally” requirement, above, is demonstrably a greater level of “cross-cutting” than requirements which have already been found to satisfy the statute by the courts. These include reference to, “touches on” JR  “issues arise in a multitude of less obvious circumstances” Central Craigavon, “engages the responsibility of ious Ministers” Minister for Enterprise Trade and Investment.Self-evidently,the intention of the new clause had been to reflect previous case law, then the language in those judgments could have been deployed for statutory purposes. It was not. Thirdly, misplaced comfort may be taken by what is known as the ‘signicant or controversial’ test, though this simplication ignores a crucial second limb of the provision, which also requires the decision to be ‘clearly outside the scope of the agreed programme’ for government. The boundaries of this limitation are unclear, though unambiguously it weakens the short-hand catch-all test. And fourthly, it has been suggested, both at the Executive Office Committee and in the assembly, that the so-called ‘three minister call in’ provision in the legislation provides an ultimate safety net. This provision, it is said, would allow any three ministers to require a matter to come to the executive and deprive the minister of the authority to take such a decision .As the argument goes, there being four DUP ministers, this provides the needed assurance for unionists fearful of republican ministers going on ‘solo runs’. The logic of this argument is impeccable but for one rather fundamental defect. No such provision exists.This regrettable conclusion is reached, not by recourse to case law or obtuse statutory interpretation, but by a simple Google search of the relevant legislation, namely ‘section  Northern Ireland Act ’. As this safeguard has been widely cited in aid of the new provision, it is safe to assume that the entire bill is predicated upon this mistaken assumption. This is not a solid foundation for constitutional legislation. Problematically for the movers of the bill is that fact that they have to convince assembly members that the legislation, with the amendment, means exactly the same as the legislation did without it. The only intervening event was a judgment by lord chief justice where he interpreted the statute consistent with the approach the DUP have always advocated.All is not yet lost. Doug Beattie MLA has put down amendments to remove the dangerous aspects of the bill, while leaving in place the sensible provisions. These should be supported leaving the contentious aspect the bill to another day.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCross Common bridge in Dinas Powys was closed off to drivers in February , after a new access road was built and the safety of the old bridge was questioned.The council abandoned the bridge and put up red and white plastic barriers to stop traffic driving over it.In August last year, the council promised to begin the work to remove the bridge that October mdash after delays in finding a specialist contractor.Now, with the bridge still there a year later, Plaid Cymru community councillors are demanding the council act, and either remove the bridge or turn it into a footpath and clear the debris and plastic barriers.Cllr Chris Franks said: ldquoFor three years, the Vale has said this bridge has got to go. If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

With that in mind, it is in everyonersquos interests that the Esplanade remains a safe, family friendly place for everyone to enjoy.ldquoI will soon discuss with my Cabinet colleagues the possibility of introducing a Public Space Protection Order at the Esplanade making it illegal to consume alcohol in public areas.ldquoIn the meantime, Council officers will be carrying out regular checks around this location to make sure alcohol sales comply with the terms of inidual licences and are not contributing to poor behaviour. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

A youth Assembly is a fantastic setting to encourage debate and allow our young people to opportunity to hold their elected representatives to account. They must not be weary of pursuing their own agenda and really making their mark on the issues that matter to them.“Over the coming two year period the Alliance Party is looking forward to engaging further with the Youth Assembly and we hope to see an inclusive body, reflective of our society today.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
