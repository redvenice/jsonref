The Kardashians  have and will prostitute every aspect of their lives. There’s nothing they won’t commercialise – births (Kourtney was the first of many to birth on the show) , deaths, marriages, affairs, feuds - even Caitlyn\u0027s sex change You name, they’ll flog it - all under the direction of the ruthless matriarch Kris Jenner, a woman who delights in setting record new lows for her family’s tasteless, shameless, shocking antics.They’re all very rich, but at what cost to their pride, dignity and soul?And at what thought to the damage they’re doing to the tens of millions of impressionable young girls who follow them so fervently?Now, just when I’d almost given up all hope of ever seeing the back of them, a beaming light of ratings-catastrophe light shines out from the depraved darkness.Make no mistake Sunday’s finale viewing figures are a disaster for the Kardashians.For such an established long-running show to lose nearly half its audience during a season is the kind of indefensible fiasco that leads to cancellation.And there’s no hiding from the bigger picture behind those numbers: people no longer want to keep up with the Kardashians.There may be many reasons for this boredom at the never-ending fake drama, cynicism at the increasingly aggressive and unedifying commercialisation of myriad products, or perhaps the original fantasy Kardashian image has been irreparably dimmed by the arrival of older age, husbands and babies?

Would I be prepared to do an unpaid gig to raise money for the school\u0027s Unicef charity, he asked.I was happy to help. And yet here, just a few weeks later, I was told what kind of jokes I was allowed to make.Of course, the list itself is a laughable pastiche of today\u0027s politically correct times. But it is also deeply concerning — especially for someone like me, who was born in the Soviet Union, the home of Stalinist purges, the KGB, gulag prison camps and just about the last place on Earth you would readily associate with freedom of speech.And yet here I was in London, the capital of a country still seen as the birthplace of democracy and as a bastion of tolerance and free speech, being told what I could and couldn\u0027t say at an event being hosted at a leading university. It\u0027s extraordinary.          Mr Kisin was sent a \u0027behavioural agreement form\u0027 which stopped him telling jokes which were not \u0027respectful and kind\u0027My family know all about political repression and the denial of free speech. I came to Britain to stay with my grandfather, who decades earlier  had dared to speak out against the government.Back then, saying \u0027the wrong thing\u0027 had serious repercussions. He was reported to the KGB and was forced into exile.When he arrived in England, he was enthralled by the prospect of living in a land where citizens were free to speak their minds. It was the absence of \u0027behavioural agreement forms\u0027 that he celebrated.Support for freedom of speech clearly runs in our family: my grandmother was born in a gulag prison camp, where her parents had been sent for — you guessed it — also saying \u0027the wrong thing\u0027.Decades later, with the Russian Federation now in place of the Soviet Union, the country is still a tough place for jokes.Just this year, Armando Iannucci\u0027s brilliant political satire, The Death Of Stalin, was banned for being \u0027insulting\u0027 and containing aspects of \u0027ideological warfare\u0027. Presumably, if it had been \u0027respectful and kind\u0027 about a despot responsible for possibly 20 million deaths, it would have been packing out Russian cinemas.Here in my adopted homeland I co-host a podcast, TRIGGERnometry, in which myself and another comedian, Francis Foster, discuss controversial subjects with a range of guests. If I did that in Russia, our only listeners would be the KGB.Ideological oppression is exactly what I hoped I had escaped by coming here. But as that \u0027behavioural agreement form\u0027 showed, I was wrong.Not that I was particularly surprised. For as we have seen, Britain\u0027s conviction in freedom of expression is waning.And its decline is most obvious at our universities, where barely a week goes by without news of someone being \u0027no-platformed\u0027 — having their invitation to speak suddenly withdrawn by outraged students frothing at the mouth about some perceived slight or other.At Oxford University recently, students demonstrated their unrivalled capacity for feeling offended by demanding a college remove a portrait of alumna (and Prime Minister) Theresa May. Apparently, her views were too \u0027contentious\u0027 for Britain\u0027s best and brightest.At Kent University at the start of this term, student officials proposed a ban on dressing up as cowboys and vicars because, rather than being a laugh, it was deemed beyond the pale. (For some reason I also have an invitation from Kent University sitting in my inbox ...)Critics blame the over-sensitivity of molly-coddled millennials, the so-called snowflake generation, for all this. Others suggest it is simply political correctness gone mad. (Even the comedy legend John Cleese was kind enough yesterday to salute the stand I have taken.)But I believe it is more sinister than that.For decades, British universities have provided a safe and relatively well-paid haven for radical Left-wing intellectuals who are now passing on their wacky opinions to an increasingly spoon-fed generation. It\u0027s representatives of that generation who sent me the ridiculous behavioural agreement form.When I went to Edinburgh University 15 years ago, I wanted to learn and, more importantly, how to think for myself.A key part of that process is knowing that it is a good thing to have our opinions challenged from time to time by those who hold differing views. And that\u0027s where telling a joke is useful. For nothing is capable of challenging orthodoxy quite like humour.My working life is comedy. I like making people laugh and would have loved to have done so at SOAS. After all, today\u0027s students are in desperate need of a good laugh.          A spokesman for SOAS student union (pictured) said it \u0027does not require external speakers to sign any form of contract or behavioural agreement\u0027But if comedians give in to the prescriptive whims of this minority of intolerant and humourless British student officials, they will become the intolerant and humourless opinion-formers of tomorrow — not just the speechwriters, advisers and politicians, but the police officers, judges and journalists, too.There is a glimmer of a hope that this country\u0027s centuries-old commitment to free speech will prevail.Soon after I went public with this ridiculous invitation, I was asked to perform at Comedy Unleashed, a new comedy club set up in London to discourage self-censorship and promote freedom of expression.I read out the behavioural agreement form and got a few nice laughs. I then announced that I would be doing my normal set in the spirit of SOAS\u0027s rules to be \u0027respectful and kind\u0027.\u0027Hello, my name is Konstantin Kisin,\u0027 I announced. \u0027Thank you very much — good night!\u0027And walked off the stage to huge cheers.Konstantin Kisin is a comedian and co-host of podcast TRIGGERnometry."},{"url":null,"title":"Megyn Kelly weighs Mika Brzezinski Butt Boy controversy saying hope shes forgiven","story":"    Megyn Kelly weighed in on Mika Brzezinski\u0027s \u0027Butt Boy\u0027 controversy saying she hopes the Morning Joe host is forgiven and vowed to return to television after coming across a film crew while out in New York City on Thursday  Brzezinski sparked outrage on Wednesday when she referred to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as a \u0027wannabe dictator\u0027s butt boy\u0027 on Morning Joe (above)Brzezinski uttered the homophobic slur on air Wednesday and was immediately panned by both sides of the aisle and President Trump himself. The following day she did not appear on air as her new husband Joe Scarborough made the announcement at the top of Thursday\u0027s Morning Joe episode, stating: \u0027Mika has the day off with her family, a long-planned family event which she\u0027s sorry she\u0027s not here because we\u0027ll be talking about baseball most of the morning.\u0027MSNBC has yet to respond or even acknowledge the comment despite the fact that the same network pushed Kelly out of her job at Today 24 hours after she stated her belief that black face was not a big deal. President Trump reignites feud with Mika Brzezinski as he...Share this articleOver a month after Kelly\u0027s October departure, the embattled host hinted that she\u0027ll be making a comeback on Thursday.  When asked whether she plans to return to television, Kelly confidently said: \u0027You\u0027ll be seeing me.\u0027  She is said to still be finalizing her exit package with NBC but is set to walk away with the entirety of her $69million contract paid out.   Sources had previously told DailyMail.com that she had been asking for an additional $10million on top of what was left on her contract.  In Thursday\u0027s video Kelly denied those reports and reminded that her lawyer had previously done the same.            Kelly was sporting a new cropped hairdo when she stepped out Thursday with husband Doug           Kelly was axed from NBC in October after coming under fire for defending blackface costumes on her show.

Until then the UK will continue to act largely as if it is an EU member state. To the Democratic Unionist Party, which props up Mrs May’s Government, this undermines the Union by creating a regulatory barrier for goods crossing the Irish Sea. At the same time, Tory Brexiteers do not like the backstop because there is no legally-binding end date – and no way for the UK to unilaterally leave it.Britain could theoretically just walk away, but not without ripping up a major treaty and ending any chance of an EU trade deal. Inside the backstop, the UK’s ability to secure meaningful trade deals will be very limited. Mrs May has been travelling round Europe trying to get changes to the backstop to support her argument it will not last indefinitely.What are May’s options?HER DEAL GETS THROUGHTheresa May has just days to persuade her European partners to agree changes to the deal.It is thought that her Withdrawal Agreement can only get through the Commons if the EU agrees to a legal addendum committing it to negotiating a free trade deal and agreeing a mechanism to allow the UK to exit the backstop unilaterally. The PM would hope that such a change – however unlikely – would persuade the DUP to drop its opposition and back her.It could also require a small number of Labour MPs to support the arrangement to counter-act the hardline Brexiteers determined to thwart it any cost. The deal is likely to be voted on before January 21 and the delay may help the Government by convincing MPs they have no alternative.‘MANAGED NO DEAL’However, if the Commons is determined not to pass Mrs May’s deal, refuses the option of a Norway-style soft Brexit and Article 50 is not extended, the only option may be No Deal. That would see Britain moving to trade on much less advantageous World Trade Organisation rules, which could lead to higher tariffs – harming British business. There are also concerns about chaos at Channel ports because of the need for customs and regulatory checks, leading to shortages of medicines and a significant short-term impact on the economy.Some Brexiteers are in favour of this option. Others prefer a ‘managed no deal’, with various short-term agreements including cash payments to soften the impact. The question is whether the many Remainers in Parliament would find a mechanism to block it.NORWAY-STYLE SOFT BREXITIf Mrs May cannot secure legally-binding changes to her deal and it falls in the Commons, she has pledged to bring forward a motion by January 21 laying out what she will do next.This will give Remainers such as Tory MP Dominic Grieve the chance to make their move and propose alternatives.One option would be a Norway-style soft Brexit, where the UK stays in the EU single market by joining Efta, the free trade club of which Norway is a member.    \u0027If Mrs May cannot secure legally-binding changes to her deal and it falls in the Commons, it will give Remainers such as Tory MP Dominic Grieve (pictured) the chance to make their move and propose alternatives\u0027May\u0027s fight to solve the Irish border problem that threatens...\u0027In my heart I\u0027d love to fight the next election but I know...Share this articleWe would be in the single market without having a say on the rules. The UK would also require a customs union with the EU.But this option would mean large annual contributions and keeping free movement of people. However, some members of the Cabinet see it as a way of getting out – and it could win support from Labour MPs.SECOND REFERENDUMSome believe the defeat of the anti-May plot makes a softer Brexit or a second referendum more likely. If her deal is rejected by the Commons and Labour fails to force a general election by passing a no-confidence motion in the Government, MPs may try to impose a second referendum via a vote in Parliament.However, there would be huge squabbles about the question. Would it be Remain v No Deal, Remain v May’s Deal, or No Deal v May’s Deal? This would also require the extension of Article 50 because it takes months to organise a referendum.GENERAL ELECTIONShould Mrs May lose the meaningful vote on her Brexit deal, Labour’s position is that it wants a general election. It would put forward a no confidence motion, and all eyes would be on the DUP.It would have to decide whether it wanted to risk the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn – a man who has campaigned all his life for a United Ireland – getting into No 10."},{"url":null,"title":"More quarter British Army recruits wait year join up","story":"    More than a quarter of Army recruits have had to wait over a year to join up, a new report has revealedBut costs have soared to £677million as the firm has failed to enlist the required number of regular and reserve soldiers.A report by the National Audit Office published today reveals ‘significant problems’ in the recruitment partnership between the Army and Capita.It accuses Capita of ‘under-estimating the complexity’ of recruiting for the military.

The delays are blamed for putting off potential recruits, who either give up or find other work. In 2017, only 11 per cent of applicants went on to join the Army and 47 per cent voluntarily dropped out during the process.          Nia Griffith (pictured above) MP, Labour’s defence spokesman said the contract is letting taxpayers downThere can also be long waits for medical records to be obtained from GPs and checked, the report found.In 2015, the Government set the Army a target of 82,000 regulars and 30,000 reserves by 2020 – a goal it will fall far short of reaching.In July, the force was 5,600 regular soldiers and officers – or 7 per cent – below its required strength. There were also significant skill shortages in certain areas, the report found.Under the contract, the number of recruitment offices was cut from 131 to 68 along with a switch to an automated online system. But the report said both Capita and the Army failed to recognise how complex such a change would be in a military context.The automated system launched more than four years late and cost triple its original budget of £113million. It then encountered ‘significant problems’ and applicants found it hard to use, the report found. Military chiefs estimate there were 13,000 fewer applications between November 2017 and March 2018 alone, which could lead to 1,300 fewer enlistments.The report said the Army and Capita have since ‘made significant changes’ but have still not delivered an increase in recruitment.Nia Griffith MP, Labour’s defence spokesman, said last night: ‘This disastrous contract is letting down taxpayers and soldiers alike. The Conservatives’ ideological obsession with outsourcing has driven up costs and resulted in the failure to recruit enough personnel to the Army.’          Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson (pictured above) called recruitment rates atrocious Last month, the Government announced that foreign nationals who have never lived in Britain could join the Army in order to fill gaps. It means those from Commonwealth countries including India, Australia and Kenya will be considered for roles.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has called recruitment rates ‘atrocious’. Capita yesterday said applications were now at a five-year high following an overhaul.An Army spokesman said: ‘We have put in place a plan to address the challenges.

But sentencing was delayed for a year, after Kiseliova unsuccessfully tried to withdraw her guilty plea.    Some of the dogs, which included French and English bulldogs, were found trapped locked in cagesThe pair fled the country, where they are believed to be hiding in Eastern Europe. An European Arrest Warrant has been issued.At Manchester Crown Court Kiseliova was sentenced to four years jail and Titas got three and a half years imprisonment. They will be ordered to serve half their sentences once they are located.Sentencing the pair in their absence, Judge Richard Mansell QC said: \u0027These offences arose out of the running of the company Pets313 from your home address from December 2012. Two puppy traffickers who made £300,000 selling designer...Germans can choose a THIRD gender - allowing people to be...Share this article\u0027During that period 729 animals, 341 dogs and 388 cats, were in receipt of a Pet Plan which came with free insurance for 28 days.\u0027They travelled from Europe into the UK frequently and you abused the Pet Passport scheme which states the pets have been examined by vets and vaccinated before travelling to reduce the risk of diseases such as rabies.\u0027The majority of the dogs came from Eastern European countries such as Hungary, Belarus and Poland and you had people who would bring the dogs back in multiples of up to five at once.\u0027You detected customers and mislead them by making false representations to tell them the business had been approved by the Kennel Club.\u0027Many customers made purchases of sums from £100 to £1,000, and the dogs they purchased had health problems from the moment they got home.  The RSPCA said they found \u0027cages and pens containing different breeds of dogs in almost every room\u0027 when they raided the couple\u0027s home\u0027On December 12th, Jason Marshall bought his wife a pug for Christmas, he paid you £800 for that pug, which he named Coco.\u0027He was told he received vaccinations and was cared for by way of the Puppy pack. But Coco became ill and was taken to the local vets where she was examined and it was revealed she had lung problems, problems with her hips and she had to have a hernia removed.\u0027He said he wished he never had purchased her from you because she was so ill when he bought her.\u0027Gemma Walker bought a French bulldog from you called Bella. You met her before the purchase and showed her a pet pack which stated she had been to the vets, she left and paid £720.\u0027She asked for further medical notes, to which you asked for £500 extra payment for them.          The charity said a number of animals, including these cats, left and right, needed urgent veterinary treatment\u0027When she was taken home Miss Walker realised she wasn\u0027t breathing properly and called you, to which you told her that the dog wasn\u0027t your problem anymore.\u0027Taking Bella to the vet, Miss Walker was told the tablets she was giving her dog, prescribed by you, were for humans and once analysis was undertaken of the microchip, they discovered the dog was from Denmark and had a number of physical health problems.\u0027Miss Walker was back and forth to the vet numerous times and paid over £4,500 in vets bills.\u0027When the RSPCA came to your address they discovered animals kept in cages with little stimulation for space to run around. Two bulldogs that were rescued unfortunately died within a few days because they were in such ill health.\u0027No dogs with infections were kept in isolation, and hence this made other dogs infected. Puppies were kept in cages in the bedroom upstairs and some were kept in crates in the garage.\u0027The treatment of those animals was nothing short of appalling. They put their desire and greed before the welfare of animals.          Customers reported the dogs\u0027 health rapidly deteriorated after they were taken home - having been kept in squalid, cramped conditions since birth\u0027This was sophisticated offending which you involved others in and was over a substantial period of time. They made just over £300,000.\u0027They were driven solely by your greed. The conditions the animals were kept in were appalling, keeping them in crowded cages. Many were in pain and your treatment of them was utterly shameful.\u0027Speaking on behalf of Titas, his lawyer Stella Massey said: \u0027It does not bode well that Mr Titas is not here. I have met Mr Titas before.\u0027He did not come to the UK with the intention of finding himself in the position he was when he was arrested. He was working as a mechanic, working 12 hour days. He wasn\u0027t manipulated at court. He was the director of the company, but it was not his idea to set up the company.\u0027It was the co defendant who met with the customers and set up the website. He was directed by her when they needed taking to the vets or feeding. He had long term employment as a mechanic.\u0027He was working long hours six days a week, he was working towards his level three qualifications in mechanics. He comes from a stable and supportive background.\u0027A lifetime order under the Animal Welfare Act was placed on them, disqualifying them frown owning or looking after animals.Speaking after the case, the investigating officer for Trading Standards, Mr Gareth Hollinsworth, said: \u0027We received intelligence that animals were being sold illegally at an address in Salford in January 2013.\u0027We went to the address and met with the female defendant. She said she was acting as an interpreter for the male defendant but was giving more information that was the male was.\u0027We left the address and began receiving more intelligence and complaints which linked back to the address, so we contacted the RSPCA.\u0027We found evidence of animals in the property and we arrested them. Now there is a European arrest warrant out for them and it\u0027s out of our hands unfortunately.\u0027She is the most calculating and manipulative person I\u0027ve met. People went to her house and she knew she was going to sell them something.\u0027People bought an animals thinking they were rescuing them, but they weren\u0027t.\u0027We want to send out a message to people who are thinking of buying a pet this Christmas, it\u0027s a choice that you must keep for many years. Don\u0027t click and collect.\u0027Please do your research. Make sure the buyer is regulated with the local authority. Make sure you know which animal you are getting.

And if you take freedom of movement and the question of immigration, this is an issue all over the European politics today.\u0027So yes, I think it would be sensible and right if Europe also responded if Britain said \u0027\u0027look we are prepared to think again\u0027\u0027.\u0027Europe should step forward with a series of measures that would allow people in Britain to understand and be listened to and frankly people all over Europe to feel they\u0027ve been listened to.\u0027Mr Blair said Parliament would end up backing a referendum because \u0027no other option of Brexit works\u0027.He said: \u0027The real reason we should have another referendum is that we have had 30 months of negotiation and let\u0027s be clear, we are in crisis mode on this.\u0027          Mr Blair said Parliament (pictured this week during PMQs) would end up backing a referendum because \u0027no other option of Brexit works\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60b857dd575f4d8fa72f06dea9e7d800a8ad8d1d/0_930_6352_3812/master/6352.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed3ad48de4b4c644ab717688d0ad9c8b","title":"burgess park a south east london community in pictures","story":"In the summer Burgess Park, in London, comes alive as the erse community gets together for barbecues, dancing, sports, and parties"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb6782bf384e4a2cf708c7190ef82f04303d19ee/0_154_3696_2217/master/3696.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6dfa801b9a1726e86e5f3d6980b61ff","title":"deborah levy books that made me","story":"The playwright, novelist and poet on the cleverness of Muriel Spark, how Marguerite Duras influenced her and why Zora Neale Hurston is underratedThe book I am currently readingThe Soul of the Marionette – A Short Enquiry into Human Freedom by John Gray.

This was not just the usual post-Christmas blues: Haig’s struggles with depression and anxiety, almost leading to suicide in his mid-20s, were acutely documented in his phenomenally successful memoir Reasons to Stay Alive. To cheer himself up, he decided to write a poem for his kids, and the result is his latest book, The Truth Pixie, completed pretty much that day. The uplifting tale of a young girl cheered by a cheeky sprite who is unable to lie, The Truth Pixie is short and very sweet. “I wanted to think of something that would comfort them,” he says. “In the same way that Reasons comforts adults in that you are acknowledging that pain.”Since then, it has been quite a year for Haig, who has been in the bestseller list four times: his latest novel, How to Stop Time, was a Richard and Judy book club pick in January Reasons, which spent 46 weeks in the Top 10 in 2015, returned on the back of his follow-up Notes on a Nervous Planet, which made it to No 1 in the summer and now his poem, published just in time for Christmas stockings. “Quite a mad year,” he agrees. “The Truth Pixie is the one that really pleases me because it was a total surprise. It was just a little side thing.”This is not Haig’s first foray into the children’s Christmas market A Boy Called Christmas, published in 2015, was inspired by his son asking what Father Christmas was like as a child, and is the first in a sparkly seasonal trilogy. “Children’s books either tend to be totally happy, all rainbows and unicorns, or very self-consciously adult and gritty,” he says. “I think there is a sweet spot in the balance, where you can go to the dark place and find the optimism in it.”A tale about Father Christmas seemed an unlikely next step for an author who had just found fame with what he describes as a “slightly misery memoirish book”, but written in the wake of Reasons to Stay Alive, this was exactly why it appealed to him. Was The Truth Pixie a response to Notes on a Nervous Planet?“I guess so. I tend to write my mental health books in summer when I’m feeling quite good. I’m such a seasonal person,” he says. Although he’s “not too bad at the moment”, this is usually his most difficult period. “I struggle with the light. I’ll know before I open the curtains what the weather is doing because of how my head is feeling. When I had my first full-blown capital-D depression, I really noticed how just the sun sinking behind a cloud made me feel full of dread and woe. Whereas the day I realised I was going to be OK was the April after my breakdown, the sun came out and I almost felt a literal weight being lifted.”Written in the same short, chatty chapters as Reasons, with headings such as “How do you stay human in a world of change?” and “The world is having a panic attack”, Notes on a Nervous Planet attempts to answer the slippery question of how we can “live in a mad world without going mad”. If it lacks the raw intensity of Reasons, it is because it is less personal. “I wanted to write a book about how you can look at the world as a singular psychiatric patient, as a case study,” he explains. “How so many of the problems that the world faces are parallel to what a depressed or suicidal or scared person would do if they were seeking rash solutions.”After the unexpected success of Reasons, Haig found himself in the uncomfortable role of “Mr Depression” or “the Henry Kissinger” of anxiety, as he puts it, called on to give advice by newspaper opinion pages, charities and readers getting in touch with often extremely serious problems. “It was very flattering but also I felt quite vulnerable, all I had was my own experience,” he says. “I felt a bit of a fraud because I was getting a lot of emails from people saying, ‘Oh, it really helped me,’ or telling me their life story, but I was struggling myself. So I had to step away for a while.”Why has he returned to the subject? “I didn’t want to do a ‘Reasons to Stay Alive Two’. I certainly wasn’t going to go back unless there was something I wanted to say.” But being “thrust into that world” taught him a lot about mental health, he says. “Also I had my own crisis. My social media usage was becoming a bit toxic, and I felt I was getting addicted to things that previously I had felt were totally harmless.”The book’s overriding message is that in a world of ever-accelerating change and technological overload we need to slow down and “SWITCH OFF” (Haig’s capitals). “We are literally congested,” he says. “Whether it’s TV shows, news, we’ve got it coming at us from everywhere. We are in a major epidemic of distraction, we never have to be bored again, we never have to wait for anything, but that is making us lose ourselves.”An accessible, unpreachy look at the perils of spending too much time on Twitter is clearly a good thing, but the reader can’t help but echo the advice of Haig’s wife Andrea (the undoubted heroine of both memoirs): “Matt, get off there!” There’s even a “Dr Seuss-style” ode to social media: “When anger trawls the internet,  looking for a hook  It’s time to disconnect,  And go and read a book.” So why doesn’t he take his own advice? “Yeah, I know,” he admits. “I’m a total hypocrite.” World events have provoked a relapse, but he is more restrained these days: “I haven’t got into any big rows for a while. It hasn’t ruined my weekend.”Self-deprecating and boyishly open, Haig is less earnest than his persona on Twitter, where his tweets on global politics or personal wellbeing seem to console and infuriate in equal measure. But he is not afraid to raise issues around masculinity and vulnerability, sometimes to his cost. He still feels that “men are a little bit behind women” in talking about gender. In a post-#MeToo world, “men do need to confess – not to horrible stuff, necessarily, but just stuff that they think is slightly wrong,” he says. “We absolutely recognise the need to be shamed, but I feel like there’s no space to do that because it is all or nothing.”It would be easy to be cynical about his breezy blend of personal anecdote and common-sense advice (lay off the booze and caffeine, sleep, take up yoga), but Reasons was a blast of fresh air for those who felt they were struggling to take their next breath few writers so truthfully capture the agony of a panic attack or the tyranny of relentless anxiety. He wrote it “almost as if no one were watching”, a conversation with himself back through time that would “possibly speak to a few people in that situation”. He was “very deliberately” not aiming for an update of Andrew Solomon’s Noonday Demon or Darkness Visible by William Styron. “They are great books, but they are already there. I was writing for my 24-year-old self, trying to see if there were any words that could have got me through that mess.”This “little message in a bottle back through two decades” couldn’t have landed at a better moment. Even the language surrounding mental health has changed in this time: the term “breakdown” is no longer encouraged, but for Haig that was exactly what it felt like, as if “everything that had been the day before was just now broken, total system collapse.” The experience “very nearly killed him”, but it was also “the defining moment” of his life. “I wouldn’t want to relive it, but I wouldn’t want to undo it either, because it has made me a more optimistic person, it’s made me a happier person. And I think eventually, when I fully recovered, it changed how I was as a writer.”Steeped in the contemporary fiction of his literature MA – “your Amises, your McEwans and your Rushdies, with some token Angela Carter and Jeanette Winterson” – he was convinced that “bleak was highbrow”. He describes his third novel, The Possession of Mr Cave, written in bed, in long-hand “because I thought that’s how you should do it”, as his “embarrassing photo … Me doing karaoke early Ian McEwan. It was so pessimistic.” His illness also made him “a different reader”. Returning to his parents’ home, with no bookshop or library close by, he had only his childhood books – Winnie-the-Pooh, The Catcher in the Rye, The Outsiders – to distract him. “At university, drowning in Derrida, you are taught to be suspicious of story,” he says. “But I was living in this sort of plotless, postmodern mindspace. I craved traditional story and structure.”The obsessions with time and being an outsider that run through his memoirs recur in his fiction – from his first novel, The Last Family in England, published in 2004 (“a reworking of Henry IV, with dogs”) to The Humans (narrated by an alien professor) in 2013, and then last year’s hit How to Stop Time (with a 400-year-old narrator, Tom Hazard). “It’s all on a theme of mental illness,” he agrees. How to Stop Time was “as close as I’ve got in a novel to writing about depression”, taking an apparently healthy character with a condition he has to keep secret. “Depression makes time stretch for ever,” he says. “After three years, I felt like I was 439 years old.”If, like Hazard, Haig could travel through time, he’d visit himself as a lonely boy living in the small market town of Newark in Nottinghamshire. His mother was a teacher, his father an architect for the council, and he “always felt self-consciously the posh kid, even though in the publishing world I don’t feel posh at all”. Bookish and not very sporty, he had “a horrible time” at secondary school: “I was downwardly mobile, to fit in. I got arrested for shoplifting.”So when his son started having difficulties at school, he and Andrea decided to home school both their children, Lucas and Pearl, now aged 10 and nine, moving from York to Brighton, where it is “a ridiculously conventional option”. His memories were so painful, he says, “I just don’t want my kids to have to go through that.” One significant difference between Haig’s generation and children today is that, back then, even if you were having “a crap day at school, at 4 o’clock you go home”. Today “there’s no off switch”. Children, like adults, “feel they’ve got no time”.He has a terror of not working – “I’d have a breakdown by lunchtime” – and moving between genres suits his “short attention ”. “It’s a cliche to talk about writing as therapy,” he admits, “but with anxiety you feel like you’ve got such intensity inside you, that if you left it, you would go mad. Writing is a place where you can park it without your head exploding. It’s a way of controlling things that I can’t quite control.”His fear of slowing down is clear from the fact that he’s nearly finished another children’s book and is “itching” to get on with a new adult novel. How does he plan to tackle 2019? “It’s the easiest thing in the world to be bleak and depressing,” he says. “An interesting challenge is to start off with a miserable character or situation, and then go in and try to find some authentic hope and excitement.”• The Truth Pixie is published by Canongate.

How appropriate he was given a the standing ovation from a panel that as well as Davis, featured Jo Brand, Nicky Morgan, Angela Rayner and Caroline Lucas. How very BBC that the final panel was four women and a man. All white, but hey.And here are five things we learned in his final show:• David Dimbleby goes out at the top of his game, as quick as ever. Also, he may be a closet remainer. Or at least somebody determined to flush out the arguments against another referendum now the country knows the real choices.• No one in Southwark, south-east London, which hosted the last show of the Dimbleby reign, has any time for David Davis, or his alternatives to the May withdrawal deal.• Given a day or so away from the party bosses, Labour shadow education spokesperson Angela Rayner and the Tory MP Nicky Morgan could almost certainly sort Brexit. Especially if Jo Brand and Caroline Lucas were there too.• As an option for Brexit, “we can still walk away” really, really doesn’t cut it, at least in this part of the country.• The Twittersphere is vile (OK, that’s not new.) But when it’s a proud boast that #BBCQT is the second most-tweeted TV show after Love Island, it’s worth remembering that a high proportion of those tweets will be unpleasant personal abuse directed at a single person who fumbled an important point.And so ended Dimbleby’s 25-year reign as emperor of the BBC’s flagship news and current affairs programme. With just a hint of a man-tear, he thanked the 100,000 people who had made up his studio audiences in his time hosting the show, and paid a handsome tribute to his backstage people. It was “not goodbye, but goodnight”. In January, Fiona Bruce launches the new regime as the programme’s first female presenter. She will surely be highly professional – if you were looking for continuity Dimbleby, Bruce is probably it. But maybe that’s Question Time, always that nanobeat off the time.Question Time was already a “thing” when Dimbleby took over in 1993. It started in 1979, when Margaret Thatcher had just become Britain’s first female prime minister, and Jeremy Corbyn was still a Haringey councillor. Michael Foot was not yet Labour leader. Politics was angry and uncompromising and it demanded a voice from beyond Westminster. No wonder the BBC took the risk of trialling a TV version of the already long-running weekly radio show, Any Questions.Putting ordinary voters (that is, screened and selected but not actually auditioned) into a studio and allowing them to take part in a live debate with real politicians marked a significant relaxation of the BBC’s self-appointed role as  of the dignity of politicians and the UK’s political institutions. The show’s first presenter, Sir Robin Day, was famous for the way he assumed parity with the politicians he questioned. On Question Time, he also assumed parity with the audience. He dismissed foggy opinions from them with the same impatient contempt as he did from their political leaders. When Day was finally persuaded to retire after a decade in the chair, there came, after a rocky few years, David Dimbleby. Watch and learn, children, watch and learn.Dimbleby has been presenting the weekly programme since he was 55, and he is now 80. He was born before the second world war. He has been on TV since 1962. The only reason that he is not a national icon is because the essence of his skill is to be the enabler rather than the star (a role he struggled to maintain on his last night in the chair). He does not generally interpose himself between the panel and the audience except to keep things focused and moving forward. His style, shown to greatest effect as ringmaster in the vast production that is the BBC’s election coverage, is to be so immersed in the world around him that he is surprised by nothing, unless surprise is appropriate.He is immensely hard-working and meticulous in his preparations – anyone who’s taken part in election night would recognise that his capacity for detail is daunting – but he can be as witty as he is thoughtful. In lots of ways, he is the Reithian BBC incarnate. Accurate, respectful and occasionally, well, dull.And of course there’s the problem. It doesn’t matter that he’s still fit and sharp and right up there on social media. Like the Reithian BBC, he’s out of time. You can modernise the external folderol of the programme, moving from email and texts to Twitter, but the show is still essentially analogue and it is slowly being cannibalised by the digital ecosystem.But then it is a mirror of our political times, with exactly that half-second of delay that undermines intelligent conversation. Yet this lumbering TV show is where once upon a time in about 1982, David Steel proposed to David Owen and began the centrist surge that led to Tony Blair.It’s also where that curious, more subtle shift in the balance of communication between politicians and their voters took place. It has given, every week, an imperfectly representative section of the public the chance to make politicians address the questions we all want addressed. And sometimes, like last night, we really learn something hard and complex that can’t be conveyed more easily.• Anne Perkins is a freelance writer and broadcaster"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebf5f607d18c0265965061ffa57bfaf6062f0230/0_368_5514_3308/master/5514.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21bd0f026bcdc0d843f6238760f89c65","title":"eggs brexit omelette","story":"Politicians seem to have forgotten that our lives are on hold, and our livelihoods in jeopardy, thanks to their incompetence“The nation has a breakdown”. This was a headline on Radio 4’s PM this week. It was said in that usual Radio 4 tone of jocular irony. All rather fascinating and quite amusing. No, it isn’t.We all respond to stress in different ways. Since Monday afternoon, when I should have been trying to earn some money, I have been gripped by a migraine and the latest episode in the slow-motion national car crash, the one that was meant to end with a vote. But it didn’t. There was a deadline, and then there wasn’t. I’d been counting down the hours, desperate to know what would happen next. In real life, if you don’t meet deadlines you don’t work again or your business fails. In parliamentary politics, we now know, they’re just movable goalposts in a deadly game.I’ve tried to keep off the news, but between the meant-to-be-soothing pieces of music, snippets broke through. Absolutely no redrawing of the withdrawal agreement whatsoever. Forty-eight letters. Lame-duck prime minister. No plan B. And the clock. The clock ticking like a bomb.The figures vary, but the message is clear. If we crash out of the EU without a deal, hundreds of thousands of people in this country will lose their jobs, their livelihoods and perhaps their homes.A few weeks ago, I was talking to a Brexit-supporting journalist on a TV news show. He told me that he had never trusted any of the politicians to make a success of Brexit, but he had voted to leave to “shake things up”. I asked him if he was willing to lose his job for the revolution he longed for. There was a pause. “I think,” he said, “many people are prepared to make a few sacrifices for this.”He’s in his early twenties. I doubt he’s ever lost a job. I didn’t tell him what it was like when I lost mine. How I lost eight pounds in three days. How I didn’t stop shaking for two weeks. How I ended up so exhausted by the search for work that I ended up sleeping in friends’ spare rooms as I put my flat on Airbnb. I didn’t tell him that losing my job felt like the worst thing that had ever happened to me. And I’ve had cancer twice.They call it project fear, these buccaneering ideologues who are happy to risk your future and mine. They think it’s a point of theological debate, like whether the communion wafer turns into human flesh. It doesn’t matter how many economists, trade unionists, thinktanks and rating agencies look at the models and do the maths. They are like Donald Trump on climate change. La, la, la, I can’t hear you.So what the hell do we do, as we watch our politicians run down the clock? We can write to our MPs, but mine is Diane Abbott, a member of an opposition frontbench which has clearly decided to oppose everything until it’s too late. They are still talking about a second referendum being “an option” that might, at a later stage, be “on the table”. Wake up, guys! The table is collapsing and the house is on fire. For Corbyn’s Labour, as for ERG Tories, it’s all about ideology. Bring on the revolution! You can’t, they will say, make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.We are the eggs, folks. There are 66 million of us whose jobs, homes and futures are at stake. They lie in the hands of ideologues and revolutionaries, who can’t be bothered to engage with the boring realities of life, global trading and the law. “Boris Johnson couldn’t run a whelk stall,” said Ken Clarke of our former foreign secretary. The same, unfortunately, seems to be true of most of the politicians bickering as Britain burns. They got us in this mess, but they don’t seem to have the slightest clue how to get us out of it.However we voted, we didn’t vote for this. We didn’t vote for hundreds of thousands of people to lose their jobs, medicines to be rationed and dead bodies to pile up. We didn’t vote for May’s crummy “deal”, which will just lead to years of more uncertainty as the real negotiations start. But we are in a war now, and compromises have to be made to end a war. We will have to go with the compromise that does the least harm.We cannot crash out. Our politicians cannot let us crash out. But just saying “we don’t want ‘no deal’ ” won’t stop it. Our politicians will have to get behind a solution that can be passed into law. If that’s a second referendum, great, but if they want that they have to make it happen. And not just pretend they would have liked it to happen but, alas, it was too late.MPs, we elected you to represent our interests and keep us safe from harm. If you allow this catastrophe to happen, you will go down in history as traitors to the people you were elected to serve.

But Labour should be ready – and avoid the mistakes of the 2016 campaignThe traditional critique of the Labour left went something like this: it was made up of purists, more committed to principle and protest than power, unwilling to reach beyond its core vote to listen to the concerns of the swing voters it must attract in order to govern.There is some irony, then, that those who peddled this narrative now loudly say the opposite – that the Labour leadership is made up of unprincipled triangulators, sidelining their remain “core” vote, failing to turn up to anti-Brexit protest marches, failing to ensure clear red water separates them from the Tories. It is as though Jeremy Corbyn has a big red “Stop Brexit” button in his possession that, out of spite, he refuses to press.The Tories are of course in the midst of their worst internal crisis for more than a century. The rebels failed to displace Theresa May, leaving her humiliated and weakened, but they’re now stuck with her for a year. Her deal is dead. Her announcement that she won’t lead the party into a hypothetical 2022 election means a de facto leadership race will now commence. The threat of a split is real. And yet anxiety stalks Labour’s ranks.At the general election, Labour flourished by painting an insurgent manifesto in primary colours: taxing the rich to invest in the economy, scrapping tuition fees, nationalising key utilities, and so on. A “people versus the elite” populism resonated, and both Labour and Corbyn’s initially catastrophic polling soared. It worked because Labour refused to make it the Brexit election May desired.But when Brexit dictates the news agenda, Labour loses its sense of insurgency. The party’s leading lights end up looking like overly cautious, tinkering politicians, tangled up in jargon about customs unions and strong single-market relationships, rather than streetfighting radicals. Inevitably it drains the enthusiasm that powers the entire Corbyn project. Then there’s the fact that all prospective options have unattractive downsides. A isive referendum that aggravates leave voters in the north and Midlands? Backing an amended Tory deal that bails out May? A general election in which Labour wins a small majority, leaving it permanently at the mercy of a small group of hostile backbenchers while lumbered with the whole Brexit mess?Labour must continue to prioritise an election, and that means resisting overtures from May. As well as the need to address the injustices that drove the Brexit result, Britain has to be liberated from the endless Tory psychodrama. Calling for a vote of no confidence in the government now would fail, and those – in the SNP and on Labour backbenches – demanding one know it. They want it out of the way so a new referendum becomes the priority.The arithmetic may change: if the DUP tires of May refusing to drop a backstop it considers more of a threat to the Union than a Corbyn government or if ultra-Brexiteers – now unable to stage an internal coup – decide a parliamentary vote of confidence is the only means of displacing May or if May realises an election is the only way out.Talk of an election inevitably prompts Labour’s “centrist” critics to highlight the deadlocked polls. A standard question is: “Why isn’t Labour 20 points ahead of a disastrous Tory government?” But they rarely ask why remain isn’t 20 points ahead of a disastrous Brexit project, because the two statistics are linked. The Tories have an artificially high floor because leave voters trust them most to deliver Brexit. Labour must again shift the narrative away from Brexit to domestic policy. That will be harder this time – but it can be framed as answering the disillusionment that led to the result in the first place.But the party must prepare for a referendum, too. Those on the left who have resisted calling for one are often accused of failing to do so out of partisanship, rather than an awareness of the demons unleashed by the first referendum, and a fear even worse monsters will emerge during a second. With no dramatic shift in polling, a leave campaign that urges voters to “tell them again”, angrily decrying remainers for refusing to accept the first result, may win again. The resulting rhetoric will make “enemies of the people” and “traitors” look tame. Centrists stake their hopes of a political rebirth on the remain cause. In the last referendum, they wheeled out corporate titans and City types, ignoring polling that showed the public had thought Ed Miliband’s Labour was too soft on big business by 42 to 22 a year earlier.But there are potential opportunities, too. Labour could tell its leave voters it did everything possible to make Brexit work. It could say the message had been sent, and remain would mark the start of a rebuilding of Britain. It could present its manifesto as a cure to the ills that drove the 2016 upheaval. It could paint the Tory Brexiteers as the establishment. With a new left-leaning government in Spain, a major EU nation, it could point to a powerful ally for a message of “remain and reform”.Labour would have the advantages that boosted it in the 2017 election – such as mass mobilisations across the country and broadcasting rules that grant direct access to the public. The Tories may well shred themselves in such a campaign, and an election highly advantageous to Labour may follow.Such an outcome is fraught with risks, and may unleash Britain’s darkest postwar chapter yet, but if it becomes the last option standing, then it must be prepared for now. Tory bloodletting lends itself to schadenfreude, but resist it, because there is much pain to come, and there are no easy ways out for Labour or the country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38291a68ee0c654dd7b2b93c25343582ddd5b194/0_57_2636_1582/master/2636.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a006b1a1b3a568fe95943aceca7a970","title":"raging santa claus christmas","story":"Christmas traditions are weird. We all drink mulled wine, even though it’s just microwaved Lidl shiraz with some cumin dropped in we all eat turkey, even though it’s just a big dry dinosaur chicken and we all watch the Queen’s speech, even though it’s just Charlie Brooker’s Wipe of the Year without any of the jokes. I mean, it’s fine, but if the Queen was really good, the BBC would have given her a series now instead of 66 consecutive Christmas specials.It’s clear we need some new festive traditions that sum up Christmas in 21st-century Britain. Last Sunday in a conference centre in St Ives, Cambridgeshire, a magical Christmas moment took place – one that was so special that it really should be commemorated every single year. I’m talking, of course, about Raging Santa.After hours of tolerating screaming children, bored parents and an inexplicably scheduled rave playing pounding drum’n’bass music next door, a Santa was pushed over the edge of sanity by a fire alarm and succumbed to what can only be described as “the Christmas madness”. As the alarm blared, Santa Claus stormed out of the grotto, tore off his beard and hat and screamed “everyone get the fuck out” at the 50 or so children – a scene I’m fairly sure they cut from the Richard Attenborough Miracle on 34th Street.Tragically there’s no footage of the incident online which means we have to fill in some of the details ourselves. In my head, the Santa looks a bit like Peter Finch’s TV anchor from Network, picking up baubles and throwing them at children while yelling, “This Santa’s as mad as ho-ho-hell”. Maybe at one point, a smartarse dad quips, “All this yelling isn’t good for your mental elf”, and Santa stabs him in the shoulder with a candy cane.The company who organised the grotto, Festival Events St Ives (FESt), immediately went into damage limitation mode, releasing a statement that Santa Claus was merely attempting to facilitate the evacuation of the building and had got a little carried away. Which I guess makes sense – although I’ve always thought that if Santa Claus was involved in some kind of emergency situation (fire, earthquake, Santa’s workshop invaded by a group of terrorists a la the opening scene in Scrooged), he’d exude a calm authority that is both reassuring and oddly arousing.FESt’s statement means it’s now canon that Santa reacts to a fire alarm like that member of staff in the high-vis vest who takes the drills way too seriously – the only thing that could make it worse is the knowledge that Santa was shouting, “Leave your coats, if this was a real fire you’d all be burned to a crisp by now!” as he shepherded sobbing children out.I can understand the desire to downplay Santa’s fury, but it feels like a missed opportunity. Raging Santa is a modern Christmas story we can all relate to, because overexposure to Christmas fodder cultivates a special kind of impotent anger. Who hasn’t wanted to punch an entire display of Tesco’s Finest Christmas cheese selection boxes just because it’s the fifth time you’ve heard Shakin’ Stevens that morning? Who hasn’t heard a group of amateur carollers murdering “O Holy Night” and wanted to scream, “None of you have the range to pull off that high note!” at them? Who hasn’t wanted to go to hunt down the people who made the cheesy BBC Christmas adverts from a few years ago where they all sang “Consider Yourself” and just sincerely ask them how they sleep at night?Rather than pretend it didn’t happen, or dismiss it as a Christmas stunt that went wrong, we should lean into it: we should make Raging Santa a new Christmas tradition for every town in Britain. At the start of every December, town councils could find the angriest person in the area, stick them in a Santa suit, and force them to sit in a darkened grotto in a shopping centre while screaming children visit them for hours on end, non-stop Christmas songs blare overhead and heavy bass makes the plastic reindeers vibrate.The Raging Santa would try to keep their temper for as long as possible, but eventually they’d crack, trashing the grotto in a glorious rampage, tinsel and baubles flying everywhere. The child who pushed Raging Santa over the edge would be given a shiny penny, and the Raging Santa would be given the ultimate prize for a Christmas miser: a tranquiliser dart to the neck that puts them into a coma until 6 January.Christmas rage is as legitimate as Christmas joy, and Raging Santa is the snarling, feral patron saint that we all need. I can imagine the new Night Before Christmas now: “I heard him exclaim, with a deranged little shout: “Merry Christmas to all, now get the fuck out”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a312b12db9c56742c3b6e22fcbaf4c8c209dc9ac/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=643a477e8cf4d6d971f1a603e9d840ff","title":"westminster 2016 brexit british politics","story":"Once again a Brussels summit and British politics cross paths like celestial bodies on intersecting orbits. For just a few moments a cold hard ball of EU reality eclipses the gaseous inferno that is Westminster. Theresa May has not secured any meaningful change to her withdrawal agreement. No sunset clauses will be introduced to the “backstop” that is designed to prevent a hard Irish border appearing after Brexit.The EU stance looks uncooperative to many British observers. Hardline Brexiters will hold it up as proof that business cannot be done with these awful continentals. It is true that the European position is rigid, but that is a function of accommodating the interests of 27 countries in a single text – a legal treaty that has already required painstaking compromise. No one wants to undo a done deal.One of the unique properties of the Brexit spectacle is its capacity to be boring and frightening at the same time. It is grindingly technical and predictable, which are characteristics of a dull thing. But watching something precious – the stability and prosperity of a nation – move on a slow conveyor belt into a grinding machine is also alarming. And if British audiences are bored, just imagine how it feels on the Brussels side of the table. At least Westminster politics has sudden twists and theatrical noises. Brexit, as experienced by EU leaders, is the same banal dialogue played on a loop. It goes roughly as follows:EU: We wish you wouldn’t, but if you must, there is a process with one fundamental principle: you cannot retain privileges of EU membership without an obligation to uphold EU law. With that in mind, here are the options ...UK: We do not like those options and refuse to choose between them.EU: No other options exist.UK: We believe they do.EU: Tell us what they are.(At this point the UK government wastes months arguing over whether it is better to use a jet pack or a magic feather to fly over a rainbow.)UK: We would like to continue enjoying privileges of EU membership without obligations to uphold EU law.The difference between the two approaches is that the EU side has been focused on a destination. In Brussels, the problem was understood in terms of an end state. What would be the terms of separation? But Westminster has been fixated on process and power games. The Tories have been consumed by the question of May’s leadership. Labour’s primary goal has been to bring down the government. Hence the obsession with votes of confidence, whether and when to have them.If the problem you are trying to solve is May being in Downing Street, then removing her is a solution. And if you think the problem is a lack of Jeremy Corbyn in No 10 then, yes, putting him there would indeed solve that problem. But those are not actual answers to the questions that Brexit asks.With so little time left, there are now three places to go.Option one: exit with a deal almost exactly like the one May has negotiated. By deal here, I mean the withdrawal agreement – the legal text that serves as safe passage to a transition period from where other options for the long term can be developed. The withdrawal agreement can be ratified or not. Its many deficiencies, including the notorious backstop, are intrinsic to Brexit and would be the same for any party under any leader. Changing the prime minister doesn’t change EU law.Option two: membership of the EU – the best available outcome in strategic and economic terms, but one that incurs serious political cost by enraging already furious leavers.Option three: exit with no deal. An appalling idea recommended only by fools, liars and vandals who relish chaos for perverse ideological reasons.Then there are the means of travel. Option one requires approval of the withdrawal agreement and an implementation bill in parliament. Option two is reached by rescinding the article 50 notice, which should, for democracy’s sake, be done after a referendum, although the result of that is unpredictable. Option three is easiest. It involves carrying on as we are, bickering about process, failing to cross tribal party lines in pursuit of consensus, refusing to be honest about what is available and watching the clock tick down.Those are the choices. They aren’t complicated. The EU side identified them two years ago and spelled them out clearly. The British public is bored watching their politicians argue about the wrong questions. The EU is bored watching British politicians refuse to level with the public about the right questions. Everyone should be afraid of what happens in the absence of clear answers, because disaster by inaction is the default option."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66410fa0483daac6039a27b586b55bb2aa799440/0_0_6000_8000/master/6000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8f48521c9127791cc9adf05e62d973a9","title":"quick and easy roast chicken with a twist","story":"Cookery writer Eve Marleau adds a French-inspired twist to a traditional roast chicken with Boursin As a kid in the late 80s and early 90s, for me, Boursin had one role – to act as an exotic option on the Christmas cheeseboard. In my prime, I could eat upwards of 10 Carr’s table water biscuits slathered in Boursin after seconds of turkey pie and an inordinate amount of chocolate mould dessert.But as a grownup – and as someone who gets more excited over the possibilities contained within the leftovers than the initial purpose of an ingredient – the garlicky cheese with the chant-inducing advert has come to represent versatility as well as comforting familiarity. I’ve long been stirring Boursin through fettuccine with lemon-roasted broccoli, or dolloping spoonfuls on top of slow-roasted red peppers, tomato and fennel. I’ve whisked it with milk to make the sauce for potato dauphinois, combined with soured cream, red onions and prawns, and even spread it on stale sourdough, scattered with pancetta and baked with whisked eggs to make a savoury bread and butter pudding. As an ingredient, it is undeniably simple yet effective, saving the lives of many a withered fridge companion. However, my favourite use is a relatively recent discovery, from a French friend: a roast chicken recipe – with a twist.Requiring only three ingredients: Boursin, lemon and the chicken itself. One Boursin is stuffed into the bird’s cavity with half a lemon, and a second is smeared underneath and over the top of the skin. And that’s it. The result is a creamy, flavoursome and perfectly textured meat that the carver will undoubtedly be standing over and picking at long before it reaches the table.Since learning of this dish a few years back, I’ve found that it’s the perfect recipe for those mellow days between Christmas and the new year, when families are still gathered, but the enthusiasm for spending hours in the kitchen to create a celebratory spread for those around you has dissipated to eating cold stuffing and cranberry sauce from the fridge on the sofa. This roast chicken requires no more than five minutes of preparation, a chopping board and a roasting tin. But the best thing about this recipe? It perfectly balances familiarity and nostalgia with indulgence – and that’s exactly what the festivities are all about.1 free-range organic chicken2 x 150g Boursin½ lemonSalt and ground black pepper1 bunch purple sprouting broccoli, ends trimmed25g butterZest of 1 lemonRoast or mashed potatoes, to servePreheat your oven to 180Cgas mark 4.Remove the string from the chicken and stuff one of the Boursin into the cavity along with the lemon half. Ease the skin of the chicken loose, then spread half of the other Boursin under the skin, using your fingers. Spread the other half over the skin of the whole bird and season well.Lightly oil a roasting tray and place the chicken inside. Cook for 1-1½ hours, until the juice of the chicken runs clear when a knife is inserted into the thickest part of the leg. Allow to rest for 10 minutes.As the chicken is resting, steam or boil the broccoli, then toss with the butter, lemon zest and some seasoning. Carve the chicken and serve with the broccoli and potatoes.Bring a BoursinCombining a creamy, crumbly texture and mouth-watering garlic and herbs, Boursin is a welcome addition to any festive buffet – and a versatile soft cheese for your party season cooking, too.

Some spoilers aheadYou get two movies for the price of one with First Man. There’s the workplace drama: just how will Neil Armstrong and his Nasa buddies get his butt to the moon? Then there’s the family drama: just how, if at all, will the Armstrongs save their marriage after their daughter’s death? The answer is out there, and it comes to a head during the landing sequence.For six minutes Damien Chazelle builds tension through marvelous editing and one of composer Justin Hurwitz’s circular themes. We’ve heard it before, but not this intensely. There are closeups of helmets reflecting lights, inserts of fuel gauges and terrifying alarms. The dialogue is meaningless babble. “1202! What’s 1202?” They don’t know and we don’t know. All that counts is there’s no turning back, we’re on manual control, and when the pressure reaches its crescendo we cut outside to the void of uninhabitable space, the Lunar Module a tiny speck against it. Hurwitz’s second theme charges in counter-melody: the push-pull of triumph and death. The scale of it takes your breath away. JH“Astonishment is that state of the soul in which all its motions are suspended with some degree of horror,” wrote Edmund Burke in his treatise on the sublime. “The ocean,” he added, “is an object of no small terror.” Witnessing those final scenes of Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma, as the domestic worker Cleo struggles through a violent and thunderous rip current to retrieve her employer’s drowning children, you feel touched by astonishment, terror and the sublime all at once. It’s the most aural and harrowing sequence in the year’s most remarkable film, an embarrassment of sensory and emotional riches.Water plays an important role in Roma, Cuarón’s visionary portrait of a fractured family in the upper middle-class suburbs of Mexico City in the early 1970s. It’s with a protracted shot of soapy water that the film opens and in the presence of the ocean that Cuarón achieves his greatest fusion of feeling and film-making wizardry as the camera follows Cleo into the surf, the sounds of which are piercing and operatic. The first two hours of the film lull you into a memory, collapsing space and time, but Cleo’s fearless, humane journey into the sea shakes you awake, and to the core. JNAlex Garland’s sophomore effort, Annihilation, was one of the most original sci-fihorror hybrids to come along in years. A loose adaptation of Jeff VanderMeer’s novel, the film is as much a metaphysical meditation on evolution and entropy as it is an action-packed gals-on-a-mission creature feature.Of its many unforgettable set pieces, the most thrilling – and grisly – is the scene wherein the surviving members of an all-female expedition team, who have travelled into the spreading alien wasteland known as the Shimmer, face off against the vicious mutant bear that’s been stalking and preying upon them.A masterclass in tension, as well as a stomach-churning buffet of bone, blood and viscera, the physical carnage actually plays second fiddle to far more upsetting existential implications. The closeup of the diseased death-head as it lets loose not the bloody roar of a monster, but an echo of its last victim’s anguished death cry, is the perfect summation of this deeply unsettling work. Even if the rest of the film weren’t as jaw-dropping (or jaw-severing) as it is, this single scene would make it essential viewing. ZVBy the time we reach the last scenes of Widows, we have lived through the Rawlings’ marriage. Following the spectacularly sexy kiss that opens the movie, we’ve seen their relationship mature and then sour thanks to two separate bereavements and a quietly discovered betrayal.Viola Davis’s portrayal of Veronica’s lonely grief, whether screaming in her chilly white apartment or waking up in shock to find the bed empty, has been painfully raw. So when Harry (Liam Neeson) appears like a ghost at the film’s climax to undo all her hard work, and mock all that emotional pain, there’s no wonder we feel justified in picking sides. Veronica’s revenge is as unlikely as it is fully deserved. Can it be the sheer weight of moral righteousness that guides her aim? A burst of fury that gives her the speed to beat him to the draw? I’m sure of it. I have seen the film twice now, and each time Veronica shoots the rotter, the crowd has cheered her on. PHIt’s hard for a movie to go off the rails when it was never really on them to start with, but Lynne Ramsay’s disorienting hitman thriller finds a new gear about an hour in, with one fantastically bizarre scene.By the time it comes, our hero, Joaquin Phoenix, is already in a somewhat damaged state (though you should see the other guys). He returns home to find his beloved mother has been killed. The killers are still downstairs. He shoots one dead the other drags himself across the kitchen floor wounded, palms squeaking on the linoleum. As he lies dying, Phoenix interrogates him, pours water on him, slaps him with his own tie, prods his injury, then gives him a painkiller. Then Charlene’s 1970s self-discovery anthem I’ve Never Been to Me comes on the radio. The dying man starts to sing along. Phoenix, lying beside him, joins in for the chorus. Then the two men hold hands. Well, why not? The breakdown of social protocol is just further proof of how crazy things have become. The grimness tips over into black comedy. It is both ridiculous and sublime. SRThere’s a wealth of great moments in Marielle Heller’s deeply felt and riotously enjoyable tale of forgery in early 90s New York, many of which involve Melissa McCarthy and Richard E Grant drunkenly scheming and bitching in a West Village gay bar.Their friendship anchors the film yet it’s presented without any real sentimentality, the pair of them shown in all their sweary, fractured glory, quietly accepting each other as necessary but refraining from ever expressly showing it. In their final scene together, the quiet melancholy that’s lingered in the background seeps through to the forefront and they’re forced to face the end of their clandestine fun together, along with an awareness of the Aids crisis that’s attacked their community. All of a sudden, so much sadness fills the screen, from Grant’s haunting eyes to McCarthy’s final bittersweet jab. With each viewing, it hits harder, a rather devastating hangover after such wonderful debauchery. BLTamara Jenkins’ Netflix comedy about a couple (Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti) coping with infertility is picking up cheering – if faintly belated – acclaim for its performances, its direction, its deft way with a tricky issue and its dialogue.But my favourite scene, the one which made me properly roar at my desk, is silent. The sweet, vaguely dappy 20-year-old student Sadie (Kayli Carter) has agreed to be an egg donor. But first she must pass a medical exam, then a psychological test. This she completes online and we watch as she scrolls through the yesno statements. They are – and I’m sorry for spoiling the scene:• I am sure I get a raw deal from life• I am very seldom troubled by constipation• Evil spirits possess me at times• I would like to be a singer• No one seems to understand me• At times I feel like smashing thingsI have no idea whether these are indicative of the ways US agencies really filter out those inappropriate for such a task – but I do hope so. The combination of psychosis and mundanity, crassness and cleverness is absolutely inspired. Such a little nugget also shows the care and detail that mark Jenkins’ movie out from the pack. It may not be widescreen – but it is great cinema. CS“Let me know if you need my help?” asks an intelligent computer chip implanted in the spine of Grey Trace (Logan Marshall-Green), who is paraplegic. He does. Stem is programmed to help Grey walk, which gives him the independence to hunt the men who shot him in the neck, one of whom is presently choking him to death. Until this question, Leigh Whannell’s Upgrade has been a glum sci-fi noir. But when Grey answers yes, granting the smartbot complete control of his limbs, our hero – and the film – becomes limb-whirling, kinetic mayhem.Abdication won’t end well. But in the shock of the moment, it’s awesome. Whannell’s pivotal fight scene is the best choreography of the year, with Marshall-Green inhumanly spine-straight while his arms punch and block. Buster Keaton couldn’t do better playing a man overwhelmed by his own body. However, Old Stone Face wouldn’t gag as he serrated a man’s face with smashed teacups or sob, “You just stabbed him! Are you trying to piss him off?” That Grey does jolts us into laughing. Except we’re really gasping for breath: Upgrade has now drop-kicked us into a second act where anything can happen. ANI’m sceptical as to whether Spike Lee’s broad, rather baggy race-relations satire was quite the return to form that its proponents have claimed, but it was unquestionably responsible for one of the year’s most indelible movie moments: the point when the film’s risible 70s Klansmen were replaced by the very real and deeply chilling footage of the white supremacist march at Charlottesville and, finally, the act of terrorism that led to the death of Heather Heyer.When I saw it at Cannes, there was a collective panicked exhalation, as if the entire audience had simultaneously experienced a punch to the gut. It was a potent reminder that for all the claims of progress made, not as much has changed – in America, and beyond – as we would like to believe. GMThe Coen brothers have always been kings of the movie moment – going all the way back to the drunk-skipping camera and heaving body in Blood Simple. So I don’t think it’s too much of a stretch to give this year’s crown to the anthology yarn The Ballad of Buster Scruggs. But which moment? The film is full of them: in fact, you could theorise it is the film’s love of moments that is its major flaw, prioritising smartcleverfunny over narrative heft.Be that as it may, the moments are still great. Tim Blake Nelson’s gunfights and harp-singing James Franco’s scaffold gag and girl-eyeing Liam Neeson’s mournful look into the abyss Tom Waits’s methodical staking out of pristine prairie. But I think the moment par excellence would have to be the denouement of the story containing Zoe Kazan it is – SPOILER WARNING – so shocking and heartrending, and is such an abrupt and catastrophic twist, that it gives the film a substance it doesn’t entirely deserve. APAt the lowest moment of his humiliation, living in illness and squalor in a Paris flophouse, supine on his seedy bed but still attended by some of his faithful friends, Oscar Wilde vomits over himself. And then he declaims, with a mad and almost ecstatic kind of defiance: “Encore du champagne!” It is the kind of thing he might have shouted at the height of his popularity in London, holding court in a fashionable restaurant after a first night, perhaps. And now, of course, since the disgrace of his trial, all the hangers-on who drank his champagne have turned on him.Rupert Everett was brave enough to have shown – or imagined – this kind of moment. I can’t imagine the Oscar Wilde portrayed by Peter Finch or Stephen Fry doing anything as brutal. Everett boldly recreates the unthinkable mortification of Wilde, and insists on his not going gently. His Wilde tries to redeem the disgust and mortification of vomiting with some sort of bon mot, turning it into an aesthete’s martyrdom. Of course it can’t work. But Wilde’s spirit is still there. Was Oscar Wilde really like this in exile? Or did he subside into a silence? I like to think Rupert Everett’s version is correct. PBI favour the films that can get a physiological reaction out of me if I’m laughing or crying or screaming in terror, that’s generally a good sign. But there’s one response on an emotional register beyond all that, a sort of silent scream – dropped jaw, hyperventilation – that denotes pure, soul-lifting transcendence. I spend my moviegoing life chasing this high, and I found it when a psychedelic demon-slayer Nic Cage went chainsaw-to-chainsaw with the leader of a biker gang from Pinhead’s neighbourhood of hell.The rampaging Cage has set out to avenge his girlfriend’s murder, though I suspect that one could show an impartial third party this particular clip with zero context and it would lose none of its power. It is a self-evident image, overwhelming, and the director Panos Cosmatos blocks the scene for maximum dramatic effect. Cage’s nemesis slowly pulls his extra-long chainsaw out from behind a pile of rubble, drawing out the magnificent reveal. As he keeps dragging the lengthening weapon, the audience’s incredulity melts into awe. It feels like watching a city skyline crest over a bridge like watching the sun rise after a long dark night like being born. CBThe moment the director Chloe Zhao first saw the cowboy and rodeo rider Brady Jandreau training horses was the moment she knew she wanted to make a film about him. But even given that his almost preternatural connection with animals was a key impetus for the film, the scene in The Rider in which this slight young man tames a wild horse has an unexpectedly profound, primal impact.It plays out almost in real time, and, like much of the film, it’s infused by a magic-hour glow that makes the dust kicked up by skittish hooves look like powdered gold. This communion between man and horse has a timeless quality it’s a connection that s the ages. But the scene gets added power from the fact that it’s the first time that Jandreau’s character, body broken and spirit dented by a rodeo accident, starts to seem whole again. WIThere’s been a lot of debate this year about the supposed “elevated horror” genre: is it just snobbish nonsense made up by critics to dignify what needn’t be dignified? Ari Aster’s sensational debut Hereditary was at the centre of this discussion, thanks to its intricate, grief-fuelled family dynamics — but it pulled off gut-level jump scares to outdo any multiplex shocker.Certainly no moment in the cinema this year made me jolt, freeze and shrivel inside like the grisly fate of 13-year-old Charlie (played with already unnerving intensity by Milly Shapiro), the crushing culmination in a sequence already frantic with heart-in-mouth panic. Convulsing with anaphylactic shock after ingesting peanuts at a house party, she’s driven recklessly to hospital by her brother, losing her head – literally – to a telephone pole after an ill-timed swerve. Coming early in the film, it’s a brutal violation of the safety line that is presumed even in the horror genre: you don’t kill off the kid, do you? Aster does, and from that point on, nothing in the escalating chaos and terror of his startling film seems out of bounds.

But this year, I hope to unite us all with a lighter, brighter version of the traditional dessert, packed with freshly grated (not candied) citrus, lots of stem ginger and chunks of marzipan throughout. This, with a jot of custard or cream, will hopefully win over the sceptics at the table. My favourite festive treat of all has to be lebkuchen. They always grace the plate we put out for Father Christmas, who seems to like them, as he only ever leaves a few crumbs.This is a lighter version of Christmas pudding, with a golden crumb, the fresh zing of zest and the brightness of ginger. You will need greaseproof paper, foil and string. And I can vouch, after using up the leftovers from several tests, that it is even better fried in a little butter (or coconut oil for vegans) the next day.Vegetable oil, for greasing5 pieces stem ginger, finely chopped100g apricots, finely chopped100g prunes, finely chopped100g sultanas100g marzipan, cut or crumbled into 1cm cubes125g plain flour 100g vegetable suet 100g golden caster sugar 30ml sherry (I used oloroso)1 pinch sea salt 1 tsp ground gingerZest of 2 orangesZest of 2 clementinesZest of 2 lemons150g ground almonds200ml oat milkUsing a piece of kitchen paper, rub the oil evenly around the inside of a 1.5-litre heatproof pudding bowl.Mix together the stem ginger, apricots, prunes, sultanas and marzipan in a large bowl. Add the remaining ingredients apart from the oat milk, and mix together with a wooden spoon.Next, stir through the oat milk until you have a thick batter, then spoon it all into the greased bowl.Cut two sheets of greaseproof paper into circles big enough to cover and hang over the rim of the bowl. Grease the piece that sits over the mixture with a little oil, then top with the second piece and a sheet of tin foil. Use the foil to secure the greaseproof paper, then tie some string up and over the bowl to tie the covers tightly in place.Put a small plate (one that you don’t particularly mind about) in the bottom of a large saucepan, and put the pudding bowl on top. Pour cold water into the pan until it comes halfway up the side of the bowl.Bring to a boil, then cover with a lid and simmer on a low heat for three hours. Check the water regularly, so it doesn’t dry out – top up to halfway again, if necessary.Carefully lift the pudding bowl out of the pan – at this point, you can turn it out and serve it at once, or leave it to cool in its foil package. When cooled, replace the greaseproof and foil with fresh layers and tie again with string this way, you can steam it to heat through again for 30 minutes when ready to serve. Put in the fridge or in a cool, dry place until needed.This year I consulted the queen of German cooking, Anja Dunk, for some lebkuchen tips, and I think I’ve just made the best batch yet. These little biscuits are traditionally made at the end of November, then stored until Christmas (they have no butter, so they keep). But I am never that organised, so I make them in the days before Christmas Eve. The authentic recipe for lebkuchen suggests chilling the dough for at least eight hours before baking, to ferment it slightly, but if you don’t have time, these work well after 30 minutes.For the biscuits1 egg100g light brown sugar1 tbsp dark honey125g ground almonds65g mixed peel, finely chopped½ tsp ground cinnamon1½ tsp mixed spice3 cloves, groundZest of 1 orange½ tsp baking powder2 sheets filo or rice paper, cut into 30cm circles (you can do this with the end of a cookie cutter)For the icing75g icing sugar, sifted 1 tsp runny honeyJuice ½ orangeBeat the egg and sugar with an electric whisk until the mixture is pale and thickened. Add the remaining ingredients, apart from the filo or rice paper, (measure out the honey on a lightly oiled spoon to make it easier to handle). Mix to combine, then wrap the mixture and chill for at least half an hour – preferably eight hours.When ready to bake, heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)325Fgas 3.Divide the filo or rice paper circles between two baking sheets. Measure out spoonfuls of dough, about 15g each, roll between your hands to form balls, then press them down flat to fit the circles. Bake in the middle of the oven for 12 minutes, until just golden.Meanwhile, make the icing. Mix the icing sugar, honey and orange juice to create a runny, creamy glaze. You can make this ahead but you might need to loosen it just before you paint it on to the biscuits.Once golden, remove the biscuits from the oven and paint the tops with the glaze right away you want to cover the top of the biscuit. Leave to cool on the tray, then serve or store in an airtight tin for up to a week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30d3f42512c913cc6874b478d356dadee5aa4f56/0_232_2756_1654/master/2756.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dc90fc7ad12e58b9434855985428d7c","title":"cooking science baking j kenji lopez alt tamal ray cooks cook","story":"Our baking specialist appreciates the scientific side to cooking championed by J Kenji López-AltI first became aware of J Kenji López-Alt a few years ago, when, in his column for Serious Eats, he wrote about how to make the perfect chocolate chip cookie. It was a really, really long, intricate post, talking about the science of it all – the choice of ingredients, the quantities, the method – and it chimed with the way I think about cooking, and baking in particular.I often get people, even those who can cook well, telling me they tried to make a cake and it didn’t work. “I did exactly what the recipe said,” they’ll say. It’s bad enough making something and it doesn’t turn out right, but not knowing why it hasn’t worked is doubly frustrating. I love how López-Alt’s approach to cooking helps you learn from your failures. I love how, with his recipes, you learn how to make something delicious, but you also get a lesson in physics and chemistry. I love how he delves into the illogic in many of the instructions you’re given, and cuts through the dogma. I’m quite busy, so when I make something, I want it to work, but I also want to try new things all the time. So understanding the method is crucial.When I was researching my recipes for Bake Off, I was trying to think how long I needed to cook my cheesecake: it isn’t really a cake, in the traditional sense it’s more like a really thick custard. Cooking it isn’t about flour cooking, but eggs setting. So my question was about what temperature eggs cook at. I found a post where López-Alt cooks them sous-vide at increments of five degrees, then cuts them open. He has a really nice visual of all these eggs cooked at different temperatures, and you can see perfectly how they change. That level of detail might put some people off, but it did inform my thinking about custards.Last year, my brother-in-law was hosting Christmas, and we decided to combine our efforts. I’d read quite a lot about brining the turkey, so I thought I’d give it a try, referencing a celebrity cook’s recipe and López-Alt’s post on the subject.Now, as a doctor, the whole idea of brining didn’t really make sense to me. Putting something in a more salty solution should draw water out of it, not make it more moist. Also, I couldn’t understand how the aromatics – all the spices and citrus – would flavour the meat. A cell has to be living for something as simple as sugar to be taken up. So spice molecules, which are big and volatile compounds, shouldn’t be able to infuse a cell – especially not a dead one.López-Alt explains that the salt dissolves some of the muscle proteins, which relaxes them, so they can absorb more water. As for the flavour, he says, that’s rubbish. Salt will move, water will move, but those flavour molecules won’t get into the meat. His solution is to put the aromatics in the gravy. When I read that, I thought of course that’s what you should do!We did the recipe anyway. We put in all those aromatics. And he was absolutely right. It made me think, there are so many times when I’ve jumped through hoops for a recipe because that is what it told me to do. But with a bit more understanding, you can read it with a critical eye and see what doesn’t make sense in a method.This year, my mum is hosting Christmas. She is militant about her kitchen, and she’s cooking for 25 people, so I haven’t even suggested the brining to her – I can just see what the look on her face would be. I’m not going to mess with her perfection. She is a traditional home cook, with skills honed over many years through trial and error. I can’t remember the last time I saw her reading a recipe. I have never met López-Alt. I’d love to though. I heard him recently on the Sporkful podcast. And you know how you have heroes, people you admire professionally, and then when you hear them speak, it’s a nice feeling to realise, “Oh you just sound like a nice guy as well.” He’s quite funny. He’s definitely more of a savoury chef. In the book based on his column, The Food Lab, he speaks about not having a sweet tooth, which, I’d say, is his only negative quality. But then again, he appreciates a good cookie enough to spend several days and kilos of ingredients trying to concoct the perfect recipe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d66b97ebc2dc2bb5487b8c25628abfb2dece3204/289_181_2768_1660/master/2768.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03482b61fc8926a1c18aca8fcc7f062e","title":"what festive drink says about you","story":"What you choose at the bar could reveal more than you thinkNot everyone can be the life and soul of the Christmas party, the crowd hanging on their every word, the Insta-paparazzi desperate for a selfie with them. Some of us are just plain old chromosomes in a cardigan, trying to make it from one half-hour of excruciating small talk to the next. Historically, alcohol has gone some way to helping wallflowers peel themselves away from the anaglypta, but in recent years booze has evolved from confidence accelerant to an entire way of life. Forget being defined by your job, sexuality or Brexit vote while having a drinking problem used to be cause for concern, in some quarters overdoing your tipple of choice is seen as a valid personality substitute.For proof, you need only take a cursory glance at someone’s social media or dating profile. Don’t talk to me until I’ve had my gin, they tell you. How long until wine o’clock, they ask. And as Christmas looms large, alcohol-related merchandise is clogging up the gift aisles and seasonal home pages of every retailer. Tote bags, T-shirts and mugs are emblazoned with whimsical drinking slogans, each more painful than the last (“Prosecco made me do it!” “Is vodka a carb?”). It’s remarkable that these card-carrying booze-lovers are able to function if you believe their fridge magnets, they must be permanently wasted. As the season of perma-intoxication gets into full swing, here is my choice of the festive drink tribes.The vin rouge brigade imagine themselves connoisseurs – “I drink too much, but it’s fine because it’s vintage” – or lovable eccentrics (ie, they wear the same shirt three days running). Whether young execs spending their days welded to Excel or new parents who find caffeine and vitamin shots amateurish, white wine is a getaway, the emotional petrol to take them from nought (mild-mannered subordinate) to 60 (aggro superhero with hammers for hands) in three large glasses.As for rosé lovers, stay away from those people at all costs. They are demons and will get you arrested for sport. Thank heavens they hibernate over winter.Former hedonists or over-sharers at house parties try to set aside their worries – huge credit-card repayments, a toddler who insists on calling them by their first name – by slugging shots of this Mexican mind-wipe. Tequila misery loves company, especially after 3am, so devotees are often found brandishing a tray of shots lined up for any takers, reminding you that “closing time is a state of mind”. Tequila lovers “get the party started”, no matter how low-key it may be. Christenings, funerals, informal drinks and nibbles at the local library – the tequila drinker will zhoosh them all up, asking your grieving great-aunt if she’d like something “a little stronger” before producing a huge bottle complete with hallucinogenic worm. You only live once, they tell you. Thank goodness.Unless you’re unlucky enough to find yourself at the mercy of a coupe-bore, the slender, fragile flute lends an air of elegance to even the rankest of prosecco, and there’s a lot to be said at the end of a hard day for swaddling yourself in a thick dressing gown, feet up, pouring out some “bubbles” and living what’s colloquially known as your best life, even if you’re only watching Countryfile on iPlayer.Fizz is an expressway to glamour for those in dire need of it, the drink of the wild optimist who knows they’re not interesting, but just loves how pretty the glass looks in their hand. Plus, the popping of the cork and the satisfying sparkle and froth as you pour lend you an air of superiority over those who prefer dismal pints, spirits or plonk. You are the apex of Hollywood glamour, you are a dashing heir or heiress, you are the Roaring Twenties. But you’re still drunk.Fans of nature’s headache-in-a-glass imagine themselves suave and sleek, the type of person who “knows a little place”, and is not afraid to put themselves on the guest list for a pop-up. Negroni drinkers – and their country-mouse relatives, the Aperol spritz lovers – don’t like to mix with anything but the sour ingredients of their favourite drink, and will pout if anyone refuses to join in. Calculated, organised fun is the name of their game, the socialising equivalent of tidying your sock drawer against the clock.They spent their gap year drinking out of coconuts, intimidating the locals and jumping off rocks into crystalline seas before giving up the tiki bars and trust fund-siphoning to settle into corporate mediocrity. Now they kick back in front of their cinema-sized television, watching wildlife documentaries and American drug-smuggling dramas, carefully imbibing memories of their youth and, after a few too many, affecting a terrible patois that mortifies their teenage children. Either they or their partner has expressed an interest in orce in the last 12 months, but decided it would be too much effort to dismantle the sleigh bed.Women like real ale, too, of course, but it’s the male drinkers who hide behind pints of the stuff to show you they’re a man’s man. Not every man, though not the buffed-up refrigerators in tight T-shirts who terrorise high-street nightspots, say. Real ale is a club, a movement, complete with facial hair and a vinyl collection. Trainspotting, sudoku and gaming are now too mainstream for Mr Real Ale he longs for the good old days, when geeks were geeks, not pretty boys in thick-rimmed glasses on Mastermind answering questions about Danger Mouse.The transformation from mother’s ruin to aspirational postcode’s chosen mouthwash is one of the most impressive alcoholic glow-ups in recent memory. Gin drinkers are the false introverts – borderline shywild – who can identify with a drink that used to be served in tiny wine glasses with neither ice nor slice, but now comes in huge balloons, garnished like a Christmas tree. You’re sophisticated, because you cry before the hangover, not after. Vodka drinkers are always on, always up, never stop. A relentless car alarm of a person, jackhammering your social media and messaging apps with pleas for your company in bars, clubs and weekends in Ibiza, so they can spend as much time as possible in proximity to their true love: the odourless Russian ice maiden. Vodka and its number one fan have evolved together, from fun-loving flavours and Technicolor vomit-inducer to the dead-eyed, middle-aged opulence of the luxury brands best sipped neat. “Yes, I’m delusional,” the vodka lover says, “but at least I’m better than you.”There’s no getting away from it, martini-drinkers are show-offs. The glass, the mixing, the weird ingredient you need a tiny amount of, the garnish – the point is, it’s difficult but photogenic. Martini drinkers want you to know they’re in town, that they don’t wait for taxis and that, after sluicing down a few Gibsons, they’re going up to their hotel room – even though they live three miles away – to order another, bigger, even more complicated martini. Having someone make them a drink from scratch before their eyes and knowing they’re holding up the entire bar queue while doing it is a heady cocktail of power and entitlement and, like the third martini, it goes right to their heads.• Justin Myers writes at theguylinerCommenting on this piece?

Lineker also appeared at a rally in London campaigning for a second referendum in November.On Thursday, Jonathan Agnew, who heads up the BBC’s cricket coverage, criticised his colleague for voicing his political views, saying that doing so breached BBC editorial guidelines, which require presenters to be impartial.“Gary. You are the face of BBC Sport. Please observe BBC editorial guidelines and keep your political views, whatever they are and whatever the subject, to yourself. I’d be sacked if I followed your example. Thanks,” Agnew wrote on Twitter.The tweet seemed to be in response to a series of tweets written by Lineker on Wednesday, as the Conservatives held a no-confidence vote in Theresa May.“Extraordinary to watch us take our country back and rip it to shreds in the process,” he wrote in one tweet. Another was a retweet of David Cameron’s calls for the Conservative party to back the prime minister, which Lineker shared with crying-with-laughter emojis.But Lineker also served up some criticism for the Labour party, writing: “Imagine how hopeless you’d have to be to still be behind the Tory party in the polls. The absolute state of our politics.”Lineker replied to Agnew’s criticism saying: “I’ll continue to tweet what I like and if folk disagree with me then so be it.” He added that he imagined Agnew would not be concerned about Lineker making his political views known “if you agreed with me”.Agnew responded by posting a thumbs up emoji, with some on Twitter commending them for the civility of their interaction.While some on Twitter supported Agnew, with one writing “Get in, Aggers” and another “Thank you Aggers”, Agnew said that he had received far more responses opposing his views than supporting them. He tweeted: “Ok. View is overwhelmingly going Gary! You can stop the aggro now.”After many people, including a Labour MP, said that Agnew’s tweet confirmed he was a Brexiteer, Agnew tweeted he had voted Remain.One person replied to Agnew: “You’re just plain wrong on this… Can you show us what contract you signed which said you can’t express political views that don’t related to your broadcast responsibilities?” To which Agnew replied with a link to the BBC editorial guidelines on impartiality.The BBC’s editorial guidelines state that: “Impartiality lies at the heart of public service and is the core of the BBC’s commitment to its audiences.”A BBC spokesperson said: “Gary is not involved in any news or political output for the BBC and as such any expression of his personal political views does not affect the BBC’s impartiality.”Lineker was not the only sports star to come under fire for expressing his political views on social media this week. Former England cricket captain Michael Vaughan tweeted on Wednesday, as Conservatives were preparing to vote on May’s leadership: “Give me a Donald Trump style leader over any of our leaders any day of the week”.The tweet did not go down well with many of his followers, some of whom suggested he must have been drunk or his account had been hacked. He later removed the post and followed up with a tweet, saying: “Note to self… Don’t ever mention DT on Twitter again in any way, shape or form.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0999374762ad5ab8b08c3c461f89c6191862a4c5/0_506_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e239404ada55761f44b6e1e665c6ff10","title":"jose mourinho manchester united far play image liverpool transfers trophies","story":"• Manager says reasons run deeper than transfers• Trophies matter, Mourinho says before game at LiverpoolJosé Mourinho believes Manchester United are a long way from playing in his image and has suggested structural issues at the club are to blame.United travel to Anfield on Sunday 16 points behind Jürgen Klopp’s Premier League leaders. Liverpool are viewed as a team in their manager’s image and Mourinho was asked whether the same could be said for him and United.“Far,” he replied, before indicating that the reasons run deeper than transfers. “A football team is not just about spending the money,” he said. “A football team is like a house, too a house is not just about buying the furniture. You have to do work in the house and when the house is ready, then you buy the furniture, you spend money on the best possible furniture and then you are ready to live in an amazing house.”Mourinho feels Liverpool are in condition to win a first trophy since 2012. “I think trophies matter – it matters, especially when you have the potential to fight for trophies and especially when you clearly say the objective is to win the trophy,” he said.“I think sometimes to just say is not very intelligent. But when you have the potential, you have nothing to hide, you know from day one that your potential and your desire has a relation with the potential … To say we want to win, everyone can say that another thing is to say in a conscious way in relation to the potential you have. But, I don’t read much. I think Jürgen told already they want to win the Premier League.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9e36121bf7fce88d5765662fb6c734ebab7e097/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e75ab0293395b74faaba5237dc438350","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"A crunch clash at Anfield, depleted Palace and Huddersfield teams, and the start of a crucial run for FulhamIt is a marker of how far Manchester United have fallen to see that when Gary Neville set about choosing his combined XI for Liverpool and Manchester United on Monday Night Football, he included just three outfield United players. The only player he picked with conviction was Anthony Martial at left wing, admitting Eric Bailly would not be in if Joe Gomez was fit and laughing that his selection of Paul Pogba alongside Naby Keïta and Gini Wijnaldum was “just an opportunity to get a United player in”. Nobody would argue that Liverpool are the better side, and have been for a number of years, yet the past eight league meetings read W0, D3, L5 for the Merseyside club. Liverpool’s lack of ruthlessness against Napoli so nearly came back to bite them in the Champions League they can ill afford the same profligacy against a José Mourinho side that is unlikely to be anything other than defensively minded. MB• Liverpool walked the title 30 years ago but never bullied UnitedCrystal Palace’s inability to win Premier League matches without Wilfried Zaha has been well documented and they will try to do so at the 13th time of asking since the start of last season after their winger earned a suspension for their meeting with Leicester City at Selhurst Park. James Tomkins, who himself picked up a needless booking for dissent at the end of Palace’s defeat at Brighton, will also sit this one out for disciplinary reasons. While his absence will not generate the same headlines, his importance to Palace should not be overstated considering the partnership he has forged with Mamadou Sakho in defence. “He is comfortable with his teammates,” said Roy Hodgson, who is a longtime admirer of the 29-year-old. Struggling to get points on the board due in no small part to their toothlessness up front, Palace must now try to end a run of two defeats with a similarly conspicuous absence at the back. BG• Spurs, saves, Street Fighter and Atlanta United – Football Weekly ExtraClaudio Ranieri has had a promising start at Fulham. Survival or relegation will not be judged on away defeats to Manchester United or Chelsea, while four points at home against Southampton and Leicester represents a good return for the bottom club. What is more, the next four games against West Ham, Newcastle, Wolves and Huddersfield are winnable. One of Ranieri’s most important decisions since coming in was to restore Ryan Sessegnon to the left wing, with the 18-year-old showing the form that had Manchester United and Tottenham scouts jostling for elbow room in the stands in the Championship last season. Ridiculously, the Sessegnon made his 100th Fulham appearance last time out and will be relishing the chance of facing one of the league’s slowest right-backs, Pablo Zabaleta, on Saturday evening. MBYes, Manchester City beat Hoffenheim. Yep, Leroy Sané scored a free-kick for the ages, but the truth is that was a match of squandered opportunities. City should have scored six, and there were no worse misses than the one by Gabriel Jesus, who planted a free header against the post from four yards out, with City 1-0 down. Other than that, and being fouled quite a lot, the 21-year-old did little else, which is staggering considering he was the lone striker in a team that had 23 shots on goal. With Sergio Agüero injured, this should be Jesus’s time to make his mark but he hasn’t scored in the league since August and it was a damning assessment of his form that Pep Guardiola played without a traditional striker at Chelsea last weekend. That didn’t work, so Jesus’s immediate fate this Saturday at home to Everton depends on whether Agüero returns – if he doesn’t, Jesus is under pressure to perform. If Agüero is fit, it could be a long winter on the bench for the Brazilian. MBAfter their surprise win at Wolves, it’s been business as usual for Huddersfield, who have slipped to three consecutive defeats against Brighton, Bournemouth and Arsenal. Next up are Newcastle, who travel to the John Smith’s Stadium licking their wounds after last weekend’s late smash and grab by the men from Molineux. It’s been the same old, same old for David Wagner, who seems to spend an inordinate amount of his post-match media duties praising a team who can rarely be faulted for effort but just don’t seem good enough to harvest the points required to stay in the top flight. The news that midfield schemer and standout player, Aaron Mooy, will be sidelined until February with a knee injury has dealt a hammer-blow to their chances of survival, while captain Tommy Smith is also facing a spell on the sidelines with a hamstring injury. “The news on both Aaron and Tommy is not something we wanted, but injuries are part of football,” said Wagner. “For now, this creates opportunities for others.” Specifically, one suspects, Huddersfield’s opponents, starting with Newcastle on Saturday. BG• How Fifa’s clampdown on loan deals may affect Premier League clubsOf all the January transfer rumours flying about at the moment, it’s hard to know which is the stranger: Brighton’s Pascal Gross to Liverpool or Brighton’s Pascal Gross to Southampton? Saints’ new manager, Ralph Hasenhüttl, is apparently keen on reuniting with a player he coached at Ingolstadt. Of course he is, Gross registered the same number assists last season as Mesut Özil – only Riyad Mahrez provided more outside the top six. Where he would fit in Liverpool’s central midfield is a different question, but perhaps Jürgen Klopp would see value of adding an expert passer to his midfield of runners, even if he does cost at least five times the £3m Brighton paid for him in 2017. Gross has gone off the boil this season for Brighton – injury-prone, no assists, one solitary goal (a penalty) – but he remains a fine player and a timely performance this weekend against Chelsea’s Jorginho-Kanté axis could remind Klopp and co of his talents. MBFew midfields can match the physicality of Watford’s. Just ask Séamus Coleman, Everton’s full-back, who could only watch as Abdoulaye Doucouré soared over him to head Watford into a 2-1 lead on Monday night. With Étienne Capoue suspended, it was a surprise to see Javi Gracia drop Nathaniel Chalobah for 5ft 8in Domingos Quina, who made his full Premier League at Goodison Park and became the second youngest player to ever start for Watford. The teenager was the best player on the park, strong in the tackle, not afraid to dribble his way out of trouble and incisive with his passing. One good performance does not a wonderkid make, but on Monday’s evidence it seems curious West Ham let the Portuguese Under-19 Euros champion go for £1m in the summer. With Capoue still suspended for the visit of Cardiff, Quina should get another chance to show West Ham what they are missing. MBLast season, Burnley failed to muster a win in 11 league matches either side of Christmas but only dropped one place to seventh. It was a testament to both their fine start and the lack of quality of the sides below them. This time around, Bournemouth are doing a passable imitation – despite losing five of their past six games, Eddie Howe’s side have fallen two places to eighth. While they look in little or no danger of relegation, it is a slump that needs to be arrested if they are to challenge for a European place and the poor account of themselves they gave against Liverpool last weekend suggests there is much to do. They look sure to be tested against Wolves at Molineux and with Lewis Cook out for the rest of the season, Dan Gosling also sidelined and Harry Arter on loan at Cardiff without a recall clause, a long-term fix is required in midfield. Like many of his teammates, Andrew Surman failed to convince in his sixth league start of the season against Liverpool and while it might be harsh to drop him, it would not constitute a huge surprise to see Nathan Aké moved forward to see how he might perform in the role. BGSouthampton haven’t won at home since April. It’s a sorry record and one that has, understandably, led to many fans losing their enthusiasm. That’s something Ralph Hasenhüttl, wants to put right. “I force my players to run a lot,” he said, before the 1-0 defeat at Cardiff, for which he had only a couple of days to prepare. He cancelled his squad’s day off on Monday to begin an intensive six-day training regime before his first home game against Arsenal. The Austrian’s high-pressing style was effective with Leipzig in Germany and helped give his side an identity. Fans won’t be expecting a victory against a side unbeaten in 22 games, but a return to the high-energy football that made Saints so impressive under Mauricio Pochettino might help the team reconnect with supporters, whose backing will be vital in the relegation battle that lies ahead. GBLeft clinging on by their fingernails against Brighton as they dug in for victory and their fourth clean sheet of the campaign on a filthy day at Turf Moor last weekend, Burnley can expect a similar onslaught when they travel to Wembley to face Tottenham. While Burnley’s players were buoyed by that much-needed win, their hosts wouldn’t be human if they weren’t physically and mentally drained after three games in six days, culminating in that nail-biter at Camp Nou. On a subconscious level, they could be forgiven for taking their foot off the gas against a team most will expect them to swat aside with a minimum of fuss. Despite Burnley’s current struggles, they took points off each of the top five last season and should be underestimated at any high-profile opponents’ peril.

I’ve got no clue what Jose’s planned. He is probably the most successful manager in the world, so he will have an idea, I’m sure.Jürgen Klopp has had a chat with Sky. First, he’s asked about the Merseyside derby, and Liverpool’s form since:You have to take what you get in football. So if that would have been a draw, the game was still good, both teams did everything we could. In the end we were lucky. If in the end two points are the difference then it was very decisive, but of course we don’t know that. But for the soul it was very important. This and the game on Sunday you do first for the fans.We felt good before, we feel good now. Yesterday was Christmas for a few hours, that’s it. We are completely in a competitive mode, really. We like the situation, but we know it’s not for granted. It was all the time difficult and on Sunday it will be very difficult. No problem with that, and if we can create an atmosphere similar to Tuesday night that would be very good as well.On Liverpool’s injury list, and Matip’s addition to it:Unbelievably unlucky. It’s an absolute shame, if you think about the game he played, wow. It’s easy for people to forget how good a player he is. It’s a shame for him especially. Trent as well, we are not sure what will happen for him, for the weekend or the game after. Not too serious, but we have to judge it game by game. We have not a lot of choice at the moment, but that’s how it is. We have still options, that’s good. When we don’t have options we have to be creative, that’s how life is.Strangely there’s no Joy of Six Watford v Cardiff classics, for some reason. If there was, though, this would be in it, if only for Adlène Guedioura’s ludicrous long-range rocket, about 3min 18sec into this video:We need to be a bit wary of completely ignoring the weekend’s nine other top-flight games in our relentless focus on this one, but here’s a fine Joy of Six Liverpool v Manchester United encounters from Scott Murray:Here’s the chaps from WhoScored predicting where each club still in the Champions League will get to. They think only two of the four English representatives will make it past the next round:Warnock also said that he is interested in signing Liverpool’s Nathaniel Clyne, but that the current defensive injury crisis at the player’s current club - Joe Gomez and Trent Alexander-Arnold are currently out - might stop the deal happening:I know Nathaniel, I gave him his debut. But the thing about that is they have had a lot of injuries and they’ve got to look after themselves. It’s very difficult to get clubs to commit. He would be one on our list, yes. We are looking at that position. More from Neil Warnock on racism. Turns out he thinks some people get too angry at football, which is unexpected:These people are so vitriolic, and that’s gone back since I was in my 20s. Just because I was playing for the opposition, there was just hatred, and you can see it. I don’t think people or stewards are strong enough or brave enough to report them. People should be banned for life. Some people go to games just for aggro, and that’s been the case forever. It is a minority, though. The game has moved on so much. But I think Raheem handled it really well.Sachin Nakrani has spoken to Phil Neville about the England women’s team, the World Cup, and disrespect:At my first press conference I was told: ‘You know nothing about the players, nothing about women’s football’ and I just thought it was incredibly disrespectful. It’s football, I was managing a football team and I had great experience of working with top players, and I only ever saw it as coming into a job and working with top players.And here are Neil Warnock’s thoughts on the topic:“I’d love to see the government appoint a mobile unit to go to certain games and sort them out,” Warnock said, during his press conference ahead of Saturday’s Premier League game against Watford. “Stewards aren’t really cut out to go into a pack of grown men and eject them from the ground. It needs the law to do that.” Brighton’s Chris Hughton has held his pre-match press conference, ahead of Sunday’s home game against Chelsea, and was asked for his views on the issue of racism in the game. This from the Press Association:Chris Hughton believes greater inclusion is required before true progress can be made in eradicating racism from football. At the conclusion of a week in which Chelsea have criticised their own supporters for singing anti-Semitic chants and suspended four iniduals after Raheem Sterling claimed he was racially abused at Stamford Bridge, the topic is again being scrutinised. Brighton’s Hughton, who turned 60 this week, is alongside Nuno Espirito Santo of Wolves as one of the Premier League’s only two black managers, and it is in positions at the very top of the sport where he feels change is most needed. The Football Association is one organisation that has long been largely populated by white, middle-aged males, and the Brighton manager said: “I’ve always thought and spoken about inclusion in our game, and that means management at the top level, board level. “If I’m looking at The FA and Premier League it’s that type of inclusion in the top roles. I’ve spoken about what I feel is the lack of black managers at the highest level, as such. What’s good for our game is total inclusion - and I think is what everybody wants to see. “The only thing that can be done by all clubs is what all clubs do. Credit to all clubs - if there are incidences anywhere, the clubs are very quickly on that, and that’s banning supporters deemed to have made racial comments. “Racial events in our game, which we are trying as hard as we can to eradicate, are always going to happen. “You hope that it’s something that doesn’t escalate. Sometimes when times are harder, they become more relevant. But racism holds no place in our game, it holds no place in society, but unfortunately there are always going to be incidences.” Brighton host Chelsea on Sunday in the Premier League, and Hughton will hand Jose Izquierdo a late fitness test before selecting his starting XI. The forward has been struggling with a knee injury and could yet join the suspended Shane Duffy as an absentee, but Hughton said: “We’re going to see whether Izquierdo can train. Apart from that we have everybody available.”Neil Warnock has done a press conference ahead of in-form Cardiff’s trip to out-of-form Watford tomorrow. Sky showed us a snippet:If I’m honest I’m disappointed we’re not on 20+, with the points we’ve thrown away. We have given ourselves an opportunity. But we’re still very big favourites to get relegated, and quite rightly so with the squad we have in comparison with others. But we’ve got a very tight squad, a very together squad, and I think the fans have brought that about. It’s almost as if we go into each game as a club rather than as a team.“Jose should perhaps avoid going for the home-making-as-team-building metaphor,” suggests Rob Gray. The fact he apparently lives in a hotel might lead one to the view he doesn’t know much about building a football team, either.”Here’s some more reaction to yesterday’s Chelsea business:Piara Powar, executive director of anti-discrimination group Fare (Fight Against Racism in Europe) described the episode as a “sad indictment” of the ignorance of some supporters. In a statement issued to Press Association Sport, Powar said: “This latest incident involving Chelsea fans singing anti-Semitic songs in Budapest is a sad indictment of where some people are in their understanding of racism and the impact it can have. They stare history in the face and think they are somehow exempt from the judgements it will make on their actions. “We should give a lot of credit to those Chelsea fans who highlighted what was going on at the match on social media or directly to the authorities. “The sad fact is that in recent years Chelsea have done an incredible amount of work to tackle anti-Semitism, much of it highly innovative and impactful. But there remains throughout football a rump of people who in 2019 will see the political atmosphere as a cover for their own racism and prejudice.“The irony of singing anti-Semitic songs in Budapest is not lost. This is the capital city of a country in which there is hatred being fermented towards ethnic minorities, and those deemed to be the ‘other’. Perhaps they thought they would be lauded for it. “We know that Chelsea will continue to work with a broad range of organisations, including Kick Out and members of the Jewish community, I have no doubt that in the end these types of attitudes will be defeated. “What is needed now is a recognition that the cultural change required throughout football to deal with iniduals like these, the abusers of Raheem Sterling, and the person who threw the banana at Aubameyang, is not by any means complete.” The Press Association has filed some Manchester United team news:Jose Mourinho is hopeful of having some of his injured players available for Sunday’s crunch Premier League clash with Liverpool. Marcos Rojo joined the injured ranks during Wednesday’s Champions League loss to Valencia, and defence is the biggest worry for Mourinho with Chris Smalling, Diogo Dalot, Matteo Darmian, Luke Shaw and Victor Lindelof also struggling. Mourinho said: “All of them didn’t train yesterday again. Today there will be a little introduction to see the answer and to see if we can increase a little bit tomorrow to have them available for Sunday. I hope some will be available but for sure some will not be.” Sky have just shown a bit of José Mourinho’s press conference, which I think is ongoing. This is what he said (there’s a good bit at the end): I want to play a team that’s capable to be with me on that desire, that ambition, that confidence. We’re going to play against the leader, a team on a high, but we have our qualities, we have our potential, and even with the problems we have, even with the doubts in terms of team choice, in terms of tactics, approach, philosophy, we don’t know which players were are going to have available, but we are going to arrive on Saturday with a team capable of going there and fighting for three points.Jürgen Klopp is enormously popular despite not winning a trophy so far with Liverpool. Do trophies matter, he’s asked, or is it just perception?I think trophies matter, yeah. Especially when you have the potential to fight for the trophies, and especially when you clearly say that your objective is to win the trophy. I think sometimes just to say is not very intelligent, but when you have the potential, you have nothing to hide, you know from day one your potential and that your desire has a relation with the potential ... I don’t read much, but I think their objective is to win the Premier League.He’s then asked about potential incoming transfers.A football team is not just about spending money. It’s a little bit like a house, too. A house is not just about buying the furniture. You have to work on the house and when the house is ready you spend money on the best possible furniture, and then you are ready to live in a beautiful house.There’s an article about Tommy Oar’s unusual number here, which points out that the Premier League’s highest squad number in 2010 was also worn by an Arsenal player (Niklas Bendtner, sporting a paltry 52). From from PA on Chelsea:The Jewish Leadership Council has described anti-Semitic chanting by some Chelsea supporters as “thoroughly depressing”. The unsavoury behaviour of a minority of Blues’ fans has been highlighted for a second successive match, with Chelsea condemning a derogatory chant about Tottenham supporters, featuring anti-Semitic language, during Thursday night’s Europa League game with Vidi in Budapest. The JLC endorsed Chelsea’s condemnation in a statement on Friday. JLT chief executive Simon Johnson said: “We utterly condemn this second incident of racism by Chelsea fans in a week. The latest antisemitic incident is thoroughly depressing, especially in light of the dedicated work that Chelsea has done to address the problem. “We completely endorse the club’s strong statement and would support them in any robust action which they now take against the perpetrators.” On squad numbers, this is ground that the Knowledge has inevitably trodden before:And here’s footage of Tommy Oar making his debut for Australia in 2010, wearing the No121 shirt. “Didn’t Usain Bolt have 9.58 on the back of his jersey for some game?” wonders Stephen. “It’s the only three-figured number out there I’ve seen (on the back of a football jersey naturally).” He did, and there’s footage to prove it:“Curiously, the photo you posted of Gigi Donnarumma includes Milik, who also wears a 99,” writes Julian Camilo. Of course! There was also Vitor Baia when Porto won the Champions League:The Press Association is seeking further response to the antisemitic chanting by Chelsea fans yesterday, and have just submitted this:The anti-Semitic chanting by a group of Chelsea fans during their Europa League game against Vidi has been described as “thoroughly depressing” by the Jewish Leadership Council, which has endorsed the club’s condemnation of the chants. 87? That’s nothing. Gianluigi Donnarumma has the highest squad number I can think of, but I’m sure there’s someone sporting three figures somewhere.Welcome to our Friday football countdown in which we will keep you up to date with the latest news as teams around Europe gear up for action this weekend. We will bring you updates from the Premier League press conferences, with the standout fixture being Liverpool v Manchester United at Anfield on Sunday. Oh, it’s a doozy all right. And we’ll also bring you the latest from Chelsea after the club condemned their own fans for the second time in the space of a week, this time after antisemitic chants were heard emanating from the away end during Chelsea’s 2-2 draw with Videoton in Hungary. The Press Association reporter Matt McGeehan was at the match and had this to say on BBC Radio 5 Live this morning. It was very early in the match. It was a chant that Chelsea supporters have done in the past and it references Tottenham supporters using the ‘y’ word, the anti-Semitic derogatory word about Jewish people. I understand that Chelsea are angry from the top to the bottom of the club – the very top actually because owner Roman Abramovich is Jewish. They are furious. Not just that this has happened again to their club but because of the proximity to the incident last Saturday with Sterling.”Here’s some things to look out for in the Premier League this weekend:And this weekend’s Premier League fixtures in full (Saturday games are 3pm kick-offs unless states):"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57c25bb419f90ff6f23e07c380204577984d0ce2/2_0_8723_5236/master/8723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68d9bf7db63ab782f125d4f4377f6ffe","title":"bolognese and bonding why i love cooking with my children","story":"With smart appliances like the Samsung Family Hub™ fridge, getting your kids to help out in the kitchen is easier than ever. Mum-of-three Antonia Windsor explains why cooking with your kids is the perfect opportunity for bonding, belly laughs and some stealth mathsBy the time my middle child Ziggy, now five, was just nine months old he had already joined me in the kitchen. He would sit on the floor with pans while I threw down the potato peelings for him to stir and spoon. I loved this bonding time with him, and proudly posted pictures of him on social media: my chef in the making. My two-year-old Zenya is following in his footsteps, often by my side while I’m chopping, offering up plates of pretend pizza for me to mime eating or cups of imaginary hot chocolate to sip.My eldest, Zayla, who is now six, had less interest in pretend cooking, but as soon as she could mix real flour in a bowl with real milk and crack an egg into it she was desperate for us to make pancakes on a weekly basis.I began to love and dread with equal measure the unfolding of the aprons, knowing that my kitchen would be chaos in just a few short minutes, but knowing, too, that there would be belly laughs and bonding that no other activity quite reproduces.Not only is cooking a fun, sensory activity for children it is also a great way for children to develop pride and confidence in their abilities. To create something from raw ingredients and actually get to eat the end product gives children a great sense of satisfaction.It is also a great way for small children to develop fine motor skills. Chopping, mixing, spreading and spooning are all actions that help develop hand-eye coordination and build strength in little fingers. As children get older they can start to read recipes for themselves and learn about weights and measures, turning family cooking into an easy educational activity that the children don’t need a spoonful of sugar to swallow. If I want to make our cooking a little more challenging mathematically, I double the quantities in a recipe and ask the children to help with the calculations. I also find it’s an easy way to help them understand concepts such as fractions - particularly when cutting a homemade cake into slices.If you are looking for inspiration on what to cook with the family, smart kitchen technology can really help you out the Samsung Family Hub™ fridge, for instance, can suggest child-friendly recipes based on the ingredients you already have in stock. We’re all big fans of the CBeebies programme I Can Cook, which has a fabulous range of multicultural recipes that are simple for children to make, and the Samsung Family Hub™ can help out here too – you can stream TV* to the built-in screen from your smartphone**.I find that when we make things ourselves from scratch it is easier to slip in healthy ingredients. Now, when we make pancakes, I slip in chia seeds and linseed, almond flour and coconut sugar. The children are happy because there are more ingredients to mix in the bowl, and they eat their creations hungrily, having hovered at the pan as I fry each one, desperate for their first taste.Now my children are old enough, we have progressed from pancakes and biscuits to them helping with dinner preparation. The children use butter knives to chop mushrooms for bolognese sauce, or help with the mashing of potato for shepherd’s pie.I talk to them as we cook. I tell them about ingredients, about where they come from and when they are in season, and I share family history, describing the food my husband’s mother prepares in Zimbabwe and the French-influenced dishes that my mum and gran cooked for me during my childhood in Jersey. In this way, I hope that our cooking together is a way that I can pass on traditions and family recipes, and help my children to grow into confident cooks who can pass these traditions down to their own children.* Service available on the Samsung Smart TV 6400 series and above, released in 2015** Requires Samsung Galaxy S6 and above or Samsung Galaxy Note 5, 7, 8 and 9 seriesDiscover how the Samsung Family Hub™ can help make your kitchen a more enjoyable place for all your family at samsungukfamilyhub"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3318994f724b574ee48a01cfaf4202d5f9c7b299/0_34_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b91ba024cc71993216c3ec641337fd55","title":"have you or your partner recently given birth share your experiences with us","story":"We’d like to hear about your physical and mental recovery after birthMost parents will tell you that nothing prepares you for the arrival of your first child.

I had always wanted to travel and my grandfather and one of my aunts lived in New Zealand, which made it an easy option. I quickly settled into my new life. Among my new friends were a Korean couple about my age, Kumlyong and Mihwa, who were in one of my classes. They were great fun we laughed a lot.Kumlyong and Mihwa had decided to emigrate from South Korea the political climate there at the time was not good, and they were looking for somewhere open-minded and accepting. Canada seemed a good option. While their application was being processed, they moved to South Korea for a while, having just discovered that Mihwa was pregnant with their first child, a girl. I was sad to see them go, but we promised to stay in touch. Whenever I wanted to send them a letter, I had to find a Korean person to write the address on the envelope, because I couldn’t copy the Korean symbols accurately.In one letter they sent me, they asked if they could name the baby after me. I felt so honoured and wrote straight back to say yes. I remember receiving one more letter, a few months later, with a picture of Mihwa holding the newborn Penny. Sadly, after their move to Canada and my return home to Scotland, we lost touch.I travelled a lot over the years, living in Europe and Africa, finally settling into a career managing community energy projects in Africa for the Scottish government. But wherever I was, I would often think about my young namesake. With the advent of the internet, I searched regularly for Penny and her parents, but never with any luck.Out of the blue, a couple of weeks before Christmas last year, my phone beeped. It was a slightly hesitant message from a young Korean-Canadian lady who said she thought she might be named after me. She asked if I had lived in New Zealand in 1994. I was completely overjoyed. I had had no idea whether “Little” Penny even knew the story behind her name, so to discover that she had been looking for me gave me a warm feeling.We ended up messaging all evening and I discovered that Penny was now 23 – which made me feel ancient. She had known the story of how she got her name all her life and had always wanted to find me, but her parents had not been able to remember my surname. However, that day, her father had come across one of my old letters, with my surname on the envelope. Armed with this, Penny did a search on Facebook and her mother recognised me instantly.We chatted a lot via Messenger after that. Penny told me that she feels incredibly lucky to have grown up in Canada, surrounded by ersity and acceptance, and that she is grateful to be fluent in English. She said she is often asked why she has her name – not a common one in Canada and particularly unusual for a Korean-Canadian.After a few months, Penny ended up making plans to travel with her family to Europe, tagging on Scotland at the end to allow the Pennys to meet. I went to meet her and her family at Edinburgh airport at the end of August this year. Waiting felt like being in a film almost surreal. I recognised her straight away. I hugged Little Penny and adored her instantly. She has a lovely voice that makes her sound older than she is and she comes across as a very calm person – very unlike me. Within a few hours of meeting, we found ourselves looking for things we had in common, as if we were genetically related. That made everyone laugh.None of us could believe that we had found each other after 24 years. Penny and I have stayed in regular contact. She is working three waitressing jobs while she decides what she wants to do with her life. I hope to visit them all in Canada in the next couple of years.I have no children of my own, so in a strange way I feel as if I have found something akin to a long-lost daughter. I often complain about social media and how everyone is buried in screens instead of engaging with the real world. But I have to acknowledge that Little Penny would never have found me were it not for Facebook.•Do you have an experience to share?

I got fed up with it.”Richards, 74, who has said his favourite tipple for decades has been Jack Daniels whiskey or vodka, said he still had a glass of wine occasionally and a beer.“It was time to quit. Just like all the other stuff,” he told the magazine, referring to his past addiction to cocaine, heroin and other hard drugs. Richards has previously said he quit drugs after being arrested for heroin possession in Canada in 1977.His bandmate, Ron Wood, who battled alcoholism for years, said Richards was easier to work with since giving up drink.“Much more mellow. He’s open to more ideas,” Wood said in the interview, published on Wednesday.“I think the Keith that we used to know and love had this cutoff point where if he had one more, he’d go over the top and he’d be nasty.

In Chad, it was a whole different experience again. By  Alexander HurstEvery time I crossed the courtyard, walked past the well in the corner and slipped out of the baby blue gate nestled into the high brick wall that surrounded my Chadian host family’s house, I instantly became nasara. It’s a Ngambay word that means both “foreigner” and “white person” at the same time. A little pack of children would follow me down the red-dirt street, chanting “nah-sa-rah, nah-sa-rah” and laughing.During my first weeks in Moundou I had protested once – in jest – to Sem, a balding evangelical pastor with a belly and a deep laugh, who was my NGO’s main contact in the town. “You know my mom is black, right?” I said to him, from the passenger seat of his SUV.He chuckled, and simultaneously looked away from the dirt road as he accelerated his Toyota that sported a Christian fish sign and an American flag sticker on its bumper.“Yes, well,” he paused and pointed to my bare forearm, then looked me in the eyes, my blue eyes. “Just look at you, and then look at us!” He laughed again, then he turned his head back to the road and blared the car’s horn angrily at a motorcycle that was approaching the intersection from our left. He hit the accelerator again, forcing the motorcycle, or clando, as they are called locally, to swerve aside as we blew past in a cloud of dust.My friend Frederic worked at the largest employer in Moundou, a textiles company named CotonTchad, where he shovelled coal into furnaces for six hours a day. The company ran a “club”, which consisted of a few cabanas clustered around a tennis court that hadn’t been played on in 30 years, and a pool that lived a permanent dry season. It had pizza and free internet. Chadians with cars, and nasaras, went there.A few weeks after I had arrived in Moundou, Frederic took me to Club CotonTchad. The city hadn’t passed into dry season yet, and so the red-earth roads were jagged with ruts made by rainstorms, and our bicycles jostled and bumped until we got to the Rond Point de la Femme roundabout, then turned on to a paved main street that lead to across the Logone River, and eventually to N’Djamena.As we neared the river, the look and feel of the city dripped away to a dozen cracking, once cream-coloured concrete houses set back on lawns bordered by bushes in place of spike-topped front walls. This was the old area that, in colonial times, had been reserved for the French. There would have been a barricade at the beginning of the road, and Chadians would have been denied entry. Now, the houses belonged to CotonTchad, and where they finally ended, the club sat perched against the banks of the river.The green uniformed guard at Club CotonTchad’s gate did his own double take at me when I dismounted my bicycle and unclasped my helmet. He looked at me curiously, this nasara on a bicycle instead of in a car, but stepped aside and waved me in. I passed with a Parisian-lilted bonjour and he said bonjour back with the Chadian “r” that rolls off the tongue. A few steps in, I realised that Frederic was no longer beside me, and turned around to see that he had been stopped by the same guard who had let me pass unchallenged just moments before. I went back.“It’s OK,” I told him, “Frederic’s just showing me around. We’re going to go in and probably grab a Coca-Cola.”And so, Frederic and I walked into the heart of Club CotonTchad, where its post-imperial rust was framed by manicured grass – the kind with thick, sandpapery blades that can be coaxed out of a desiccated ground with only mildly exorbitant water use. We sat in plastic chairs at a round plastic table, flecked with our own sweat. It was pushing past 30C. I ordered the two most expensive Cokes in Moundou. Frederic poured his into a glass, I drank mine from the bottle. The Coke left a saccharine film in my mouth.Then we biked home in the rain, and even in the downpour I felt hot and dirty. On the way back an unknown stranger stopped us on the side of the road in the rain. He yelled something in Ngambay, and Frederic tried to calm him down. He looked at me then, in his stained and torn green shirt, gestured toward my helmet, and spoke to me in French.“A white man in Africa, he’s permitted everything,” he said with anger. “But what if I were to go to Europe, to France – what would happen then?”Biking away, in a country where I was unquestionably privileged and seen as white, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was passing, and that maybe, just maybe, this man was the only other one who knew. In Chad, I couldn’t have it both ways, couldn’t slip into the well-defined role of being white when it suited me, and then set myself apart from it when it did not. In Chad I was white.Passing for white is a well-anchored, though marginal, phenomenon in American racial history. There was never a uniform definition of who “counted” as black in the US, alternating between one-quarter ancestry (Virginia’s designation of “mulatto” in 1822), and the “one-drop rule” that spread throughout southern states during the Jim Crow era.Even as late as 1982, Susie Guillory Phipps, who identified as white, but whose great-great-great-great-grandmother was black, brought a lawsuit against the state of Louisiana to overturn the law forcing her birth certificate to declare her to be black. The law – a 1970 update from a previous one whose standard was “a trace of Negro ancestry” – had established 132 as the new colour line, and state genealogists had determined that Susie Phipps was 332 black. She lost her case.“It’s funny about passing,” the 1920s author Nella Larsen writes in one of the earliest novels to engage the phenomenon, “we disapprove of it and at the same time condone it. It excites our contempt and yet we rather admire it. We shy away from it with an odd kind of revulsion, but we protect it.” At the time she was writing, between 2,500 and 30,000 African Americans with light enough skin and physical features that allowed them to “pass” unquestioned into white society often did.Adrian Piper, ambiguously pigmented and a conceptual artist, writes in an essay, Passing for White, Passing for Black, that “in the African American community, we do not ‘out’ people who are passing as white in the European American community,” perhaps in recognition of a decision born in some sort of pain.Internalised racism, some may taunt. Pity, others may respond. The desire for “whiteness” shows up throughout our history as a persistent response to racism, or our notions of beauty, or a desire to belong, to be privy to the intimate moments of the Leitkultur through the unacknowledged silence that acknowledges you as just that. And those moments can happen, they can buzz in and out of your life, leaving you flecked with power and its seductiveness one moment, and then a sense of disembodiment in the next.One day you can grab your coffee from the counter of a Parisian cafe, cringing as the barista asks where you’re from, and then replies – curiously, innocently, unaware of what her words mean in the context of a country that has in its history counted people as fractions – that you don’t look cent pour cent américain, and the next day your friend’s uncle can tell you that he’s actually been to Ohio once for business, to Cincinnati, where he stayed in a motel that was kind of scary, he explains, leaning in and dropping his voice low, because the whole place was – almost to a whisper now – filled with black people.It can be tauntingly, cloyingly sweet to pass into the club in silence, unchallenged.The word “passing” entered my lexicon in the early days of 1999, when I was eight years old. We had had five snow days in a row, which was almost unheard of. Every night we kept putting our pyjamas on inside-out for luck, and every night it kept raging snow and ice. With the days off, I had read Black Like Me, John Howard Griffin’s account of the way he chemically darkened his skin and then intentionally passed for black while travelling through the deep south in the 1950s.A sprawling, abandoned lot sat across the street from my house, next to a meatpacking plant that made the whole block smell like sausage on Wednesday afternoons. The neighbourhood was a little mecca of multiculturalism in the middle of a ruined midwestern steel town that didn’t mean it was tranquil. In a city split by its river between a predominantly white west side and a black east side, the neighbourhood, which fell just west of the river, was seeing its own racial isions revealed and exacerbated by a nascent onslaught of gentrification. Every block-club meeting became a battle royale for the soul of the neighbourhood, roiling with the tensions between the (white) “social justice gentrifiers”, the (white) “urban warrior gentrifiers” who had followed them a decade later, and the minority residents who preceded both and were slowly being priced out of the few square miles of city they called home.Yet the neighbourhood had still only rounded the first base of gentrification. Though dotted with half-finished, half-million-dollar “townhomes”, it still hosted a shabby, peeling Catholic Worker house and community theatre in the southern half, a big open-air food market to the east, a gay spa and gay nightclub around the corner from my street, and the housing projects on the northern edge by the lake.Each part of the neighbourhood had its characters. There was Shorty, a sometimes – no, mostly – homeless handyman who once saved an elderly couple from a burning house and collected his citizen of the year award in paint-dripped cargo shorts. “Bubby” Hawk, a teenage guy who swore incessantly, had a trick bike pimped out with neon lights and gold handlebars, and who set off bottle rockets next to the browned-out carcasses of the old cars in his house’s yard. The screech from the bottle rockets upset the retired judge and second world war veteran-turned-pacifist down the street because the sound took him back to Normandy, where he had lain shot in the back. A well-off, white investor, who would eventually develop the vacant lot into fortress-like townhomes, loved peeling down the street in his red, vintage Ferrari and would put up the neighbourhood’s sole “BushCheney” sign in front of his house.An evangelical pastor who lived at the intersection of Bubby’s home and the lot had painted, in slightly off-level stencilled red letters, “The John 3:16 Building” on his large but ageing house. The Catholic Workers, with a completely different interpretation of the “Red Letters”, protested against the Cleveland Air Show (or more precisely, the military presence at it) every summer with signs, songs and street theatre. And our neighbourhood mailman (also a Catholic deacon), hosted a legendary fall potluck party in his backyard that, without fail, degenerated into fairly serious drinking with a light touch of pot after midnight.That winter, the lot was still empty, and a pickup kept ploughing the gravel circle in the middle, which meant that the snowbanks it created kept getting higher and higher, reinforced every time it stormed ice. We tunnelled them out and ringed the tunnels with snow-forts. Other kids decided they would knock the forts down, and kick the tunnels in. As they chased me into my house, the words they shouted stuck. “Get whitey!” they yelled.“Yeah, let’s jump this little white boy’s ass.”They had no idea that a few years later, when I became a pre-teen, my mother and I would come close to having the talk.“Look at me,” she would say one day, as if the thought had been squatting at the back of her mind, and she wanted to express it before it got lost. “When you walk out of a store, don’t keep your hands in your pocket. I saw you do that the other day. Things might be different when you’re out with your father, but you don’t want to give anyone any reason or excuse to accuse you of shoplifting.”“You’re a young black man,” she added. “Even if your friends end up fine, you’re the one who will end up in trouble.”But in the winter of 1999, at not quite nine years old, the trouble on my mind was literally on the outside of a glass door, looking in. As the group of boys angrily pelted the house and cars with snow, I held up my middle finger at them, felt my heart beat, stared and determined to myself that there was extraordinarily little that I had in common with them, or wanted to have in common with them.I knew that outside that door, I was physically powerless. As a product of an educated, leftist social circle, I knew – perversely – that my power, a fundamentally greater power, was structural. It lay in my ability to navigate with confidence and ease the codes, institutions and expectations of polite, white, society. The choice between power and powerlessness seemed so clear.I wore successive pairs of neon-yellow running shoes when I was young my group of neighbourhood friends (three white, one black) told me they were “pretty white”. I got good grades, and to my classmates, that too was “pretty white”. The syntax I used, the way I formed words between my tongue and teeth. Pretty white. My favourite song was Everlong by the Foo Fighters, I was building a desktop computer at the weekends, every year I reread practically the entire Tolkien canon. It was all pretty white, pretty white, pretty white.I wrote about the yellow shoes in my college application essay and got into Amherst, an elite liberal arts college in overwhelmingly white western Massachusetts. Because my exam scores qualified me for a national scholarship only available to African American students, I got to cash a $2,500 cheque and didn’t have to join the work-study scheme. And I felt like an impostor, like no matter what I wore, it would always be a disguise.I had crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, where police attacked civil rights protesters in 1965, and grown up reading books like Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry. I had watched Amistad and newsreels of firehoses pinning protesters against walls while police dogs snapped at their feet and officers bashed their heads in with billy clubs. I had gone to teach-ins about the Children’s March of 1963 in Birmingham, Alabama summer social justice camps about race and class and urban poverty learned about the early civil rights leader Ida B Wells and stepped into sanctuaries that had welcomed Martin Luther King. I knew the lyrics to Go Down Moses, and had celebrated Juneteenth, the holiday that celebrates the end of African American enslavement.And still, I thought, what right did my clear blue eyes – the ones that got me stopped in public by middle-aged women, that brought compliments from security guards and pre-911 trips to the cockpit from flight attendants – what right did those eyes have to inhabit someone else’s struggle, someone else’s pain?It was only years later that I would learn about the myriad moments of discrimination my mother had hidden from me while I was growing up. Like the neighbours who had eventually stopped their children from playing with me when I was five. “Not the chocolate ones,” she had overheard the woman say to her daughter. Or how despite an extremely high score on my entrance exam to Saint Ignatius high school, I had been “overlooked” for the honours programme until my mother had intervened with an admissions officer. The school, she told me just recently, had a history of doing that to minority students.Across geography and time, human cultures have found common ground in their unease with things that are liminal – things that can’t easily be classed and thus neatly ordered. Mary Douglas writes about this in her 1966 anthropology classic, Purity and Danger: An Analysis of Concepts of Pollution and Taboo, where she dissects cleanliness and uncleanliness, forbidden foods, and things that make us feel uneasy. These are things that straddle definitions, exist between two categories, like animals that parteth the hoof but cheweth not the cud.Philip Roth tells us why his main character in The Human Stain, Coleman Silk, decides to forsake his identity and pass for – become? – a white Jew. “All he’d ever wanted since earliest childhood was to be free: not black, not even white – just on his own and free.” But he can’t be just on his own and free, and so he decides that there is at least more freedom to be had by being white. Coleman Silk decides not to be liminal, not to be a walking, living taboo. Is passing an act of capitulation, or resistance? A rejection of identity, or of identification?The challenge and irony put before those who pass as white is that white is an unspoken norm. Successive waves of immigrants have arrived in the United States and acquired whiteness. The Irish needed not apply, but then they became white. Italians, ostracised and Catholic – they too became white.There is history and heritage in being Scottish or Swedish, Hungarian or Polish, or any other European ethnicity traditionally associated with white skin. White, though – is it anything other than a stand-in for power? A definition for something that needs not be defined, but simply is? Whiteness is never the identified half of a mixed identity. As a girlfriend once observantly pointed out, I have never, ever, reflexively referred to myself as “half-white”, a linguistic construction that is itself active, rather than just is. To paraphrase Larsen, it’s funny about whiteness – in order to claim it, passers have to racialise it, define it, give it some sort of mass and shape. They have to “act white”.But is it even possible to pin down an ontological whiteness?By April, Chad’s dry season, I had to lean my arm way down over the edge of the well, grasping the frayed ends of the rope with fingertips, in order to lower the leather sack down far enough to touch the surface of the water and slowly slip beneath. Dry season near the equator is a series of sun-forced strabismic glances. Months of cursing the sun and wiping your brow repeatedly, until you could swear that the skin there had been worn thin.One day just after the dry season had passed, after water had finally shot down from the sky with such force that it kicked sand up into the air and shook mangoes from trees, I was walking home from the market with two Chadian friends. We stepped to the side of the road to get out of the way of a motorcycle, whose driver sped by in a cloud of dust, his jellaba puffing out around him a chimera, fat with wind.Because we had moved, we were close enough to two little girls sitting on the side of the road to hear them speak. I couldn’t understand their Ngambay, but they were giggling.One of my friends burst into a big, open-mouth laugh. “Those girls,” he told me. “One said, ‘Look, there goes the nasara.’ And the other one said, ‘No, he’s not a nasara, he just looks like one. He’s really Chadian on the inside.’”This article was first published by Hazlitt, the online literary magazine.

We would like in a few weeks for our UK friends to set out their expectations because this debate is sometimes nebulous and imprecise and I would like clarifications.”Deliberately avoiding the confrontational approach demanded by her hard Brexit critics, May had appealed to her EU counterparts to work with her in revising the Brexit deal. “We must get this right,” she said. “Let’s hold nothing in reserve, let’s work intensively to get this over the line.”The prime minister told the summit that “we have to change the perception that the backstop is a trap” – clearly signalling that it had to be time-limited – and insisted that with revisions her deal was “the only deal capable of getting through parliament” to bring EU leaders on side.But Juncker said that he could not understand the mindset of British MPs, and indicated an unwillingness to bend to the Commons, setting up a nervous few weeks for Downing Street.He said: “I am still of the opinion that Mrs May is fighting hard and bravely but we have not seen results.”Some EU sources said there would be no further “reassurances” for the UK other than the short statement agreed over dinner on Thursday in Brussels, dashing hopes of more complicated legal wheezes, such as treaties deposited at the UN.“This is it, as I understand it,” said an EU source, pointing out the European summit conclusions were binding on members. A second EU diplomat said the “door was still open”, but complained that May had not explained what she was seeking in enough detail in her address to the leaders.May had billed her appeal as the last opportunity to save her unpopular deal and get it through parliament in time for the 29 March deadline, although it was unclear that the move would persuade a sceptical Democratic Unionist party and hard Brexit Conservatives that the UK cannot be stuck in the backstop.The prime minister still hopes to begin a short, intense period of final negotiations with EU officials following the Brussels summit, leading to an additional guarantee that No 10 insists must have legal weight.But a final version of the summit communique published by the EU leaders late on Thursday was less generous to May than earlier drafts.Irish objections led the removal of a phrase that the EU “stands ready to examine whether any further assurance can be provided” on the backstop. Wording that the the backstop would not be “a desirable outcome” was also cut from the text.The UK had hoped to set a year as a target for getting out of the backstop by negotiating a free trade deal or an alternative arrangement for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. It is still hoped that further talks can run on through Christmas on such a document.With little prospect of a quick breakthrough though Downing Street conceded that the delayed meaningful vote on what is likely to be a revised Brexit deal would not take place until the new year. It would go ahead “as soon as possible in January” having previously said it would take place before 21 January.May’s reputation rests on resolving the impasse, after an intensely difficult week, in which she was forced to pull the vote on the original Brexit deal on Tuesday because she had no chance of getting it through the House of Commons.That prompted hostile Conservative MPs to table a motion of no confidence in her as party leadership, which she saw off on Wednesday by 200 to 117.In Brussels on Thursday, May was forced to publicly repeat a promise she had made to Conservative MPs, when pleading for her job before the party’s 1922 Committee the day before, that she would not lead the party into the next general election.The prime minister acknowledged that she “would love to be able to lead the Conservative party into the next general election”, which she said would be as scheduled in 2022, but conceded “I think it is right that the party feels it would prefer to go into that election with a new leader.”In Brussels, a bilateral meeting between May and Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, underscored the diplomatic difficulties ahead of May. Varadkar said his British counterpart had made a range of suggestions to break the deadlock, some of which “made sense, others I thought were difficult”.A backstop is deemed necessary by the EU to ensure that there will be no return to a hard border in Ireland in the event that the UK and the EU cannot sign a long-term free trade deal. If it comes into force, the UK would remain in a customs union with the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2729913c5f37f50d496852ddbf9d2fbef0edd803/271_144_3676_2206/master/3676.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=662d8895979a599327e943203c3ba5fb","title":"eu leaders tell may to find brexit consensus among mps","story":"Heads of EU27 appeal to British politicians to be responsible and find solution to impasseTheresa May has been told to return to parliament and find a way to break the Brexit logjam after she failed to convince EU leaders in Brussels that she had a credible plan to win round MPs.An appeal from the prime minister for a final concession on Thursday night failed to impress the 27 heads of state and government. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, described the British debate as “nebulous” and told May to come back to them with a clear plan.Video footage of the leaders gathering for Friday morning’s talks captured May in a frosty exchange with Juncker, who appeared to be trying to calm a clearly angered prime minister.Arriving for the second day of the summit, leaders reiterated that they would not renegotiate the deal on the table, and made a direct appeal to British MPs to be “responsible” and offer a way out of the impasse.Denmark’s prime minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, said the EU was being “as flexible as we can be. I think it is now up to the British to come together and create a kind of national consensus in order to tell us exactly what to do to get this through the British parliament.”The prime minister of Luxembourg, Xavier Bettel, said the discussions with May had been an “honest exchange”.“Theresa May is clear, but the fact is that Westminster is not that clear. So we know what Theresa wants, and she wants the best possible deal in Westminster, but the problem is the MPs in London,” he said.“For internal political reasons some people want to gamble with the relations between the European Union and the UK for the future, and it is bad.”The UK’s prime minister had pinned her hopes on a last-ditch effort to persuade the European Union to work with her in devising a legal guarantee, known as a “joint interpretative instrument”, that she believes could get her Brexit deal through parliament.The British government is seeking to place a duty on both sides to try to get out of the Irish backstop within 12 months of it coming into force, a proposal supported by Germany’s Angela Merkel and the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz.A backstop is required to ensure there is no hard border in Ireland if a comprehensive free trade deal cannot be signed before the end of 2020. Theresa May has proposed to the EU that the whole of the UK would remain in the customs union after Brexit, but Brussels has said it needs more time to evaluate the proposal. As a result, the EU insists on having its own backstop - the backstop to the backstop - which would mean Northern Ireland would remain in the single market and customs union in the absence of a free trade deal, prompting fierce objections from Conservative hard Brexiters and the DUP, which props up her government. That prompted May to propose a country-wide alternative in which the whole of the UK would remain in parts of the customs union after Brexit. “The EU still requires a ‘backstop to the backstop’ – effectively an insurance policy for the insurance policy. And they want this to be the Northern Ireland-only solution that they had previously proposed,” May told MPs. Raising the stakes, the prime minister said the EU’s insistence amounted to a threat to the constitution of the UK: “We have been clear that we cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom,” she added.But it was opposed by Ireland, France, Sweden, Spain and Belgium, who voiced doubts that May would be able to sell the technical concession to hostile MPs in Westminster.Arriving for the morning’s talks on eurozone reform, Kurz offered May a glimmer of hope that leaders could still be convinced to provide her with the legal guarantee she sought.“I think that it was good that we told Theresa May once again that we will not reopen the withdrawal agreement,” he said, “but besides the withdrawal agreement there is a huge understanding on the wish to find a way to deal with Brexit.”However, EU diplomats said May had come to the summit without a plan that Brussels believed could convince enough MPs to back the withdrawal agreement, including the thorny issue of the backstop.Downing Street sources said there would be “plenty to discuss today” with the EU leaders, although Brexit was not formally on the agenda.The summit communique published on Thursday night was less generous to May than earlier drafts. Irish objections had resulted in the removal of a phrase that the EU “stands ready to examine whether any further assurance can be provided” on the backstop. Wording that the backstop would not be “a desirable outcome” was also cut from the text.Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, said he was “very satisfied” with the statement and the Croatian prime minister, Andrej Plenković, insisted the British prime minister had not been treated unfairly.He said: “I think it was a very constructive approach by the council. I didn’t see really any hard time in the meeting where she was present or afterwards.“We have sent another signal of what was already said on 25 November, very clearly insisting on the negotiated solution.“I think the text that we agreed on yesterday was a solid signal, first of all to the prime minister, and to MPs in the Commons. Now the responsibility is on the UK side. First we need to see how things will evolve when it comes to the vote.”The UK had hoped for a January summit, where the legal instrument sought by the prime minister could be signed off before a vote in parliament."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7ea6e8d0daf0cd6a75e98b994566d8a5c1d472d/0_178_5339_3204/master/5339.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49fa0a9c67081e788c889dd456587fff","title":"theresa may returns to uk to face backbenchers after brussels knockback politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments, as Tory backbench anger simmers after EU warns deal ‘not open for negotiation’It was only a matter of time … Channel 5 News has employed “two expert lip readers” to tell it what we had all worked out for ourselves – that Theresa May accused Jean-Claude Juncker of describing her as “nebulous” during the heated exchange captured on camera this morning.The Times has been told that European leaders decided last night not to help Theresa May sell her Brexit deal to parliament.British negotiators had agreed a draft statement with the most senior EU officials that would have provided “political comfort” to Mrs May that the bloc was prepared to compromise on the Irish backstop. At a dinner last night, held without her, European leaders went back on the joint agreement in order to send a message to MPs that no further concessions would be forthcoming from Brussels.“To use a Christmas theme, we want all parties and factions in the British parliament to feel the bleak midwinter,” said a senior EU source.Theresa May is due to give a press conference from Brussels at midday, though it looks like it is delayed.The Mirror is reporting that Westminster bridge has been blocked by pro-Brexit protesters wearing yellow vests. The politan police confirmed they were aware of the protest and said there had not been any arrests.Transport for London tweeted: “Buses serving routes via Westminster Bridge Road may be delayed because of a demonstration which is blocking the road.”This from David Phinnemore, a professor of European politics at Queen’s university in Belfast, provides a useful analysis on how “the Irish question” came to dominate the Brexit process.Here is that footage of May and Juncker in a “frosty exchange”. There’s a lot of speculation on Twitter about what they might be saying to each other. Is anyone any good at lip reading?It’s Frances Perraudin here, taking over from Ben Quinn for a few hours. Tony Blair has started speaking at a People’s Vote event at the Royal Academy in London. The Tony Blair Institute Twitter account is tweeting extracts of the speech.He told the Today programme this morning that there would soon be a majority in parliament for a second referendum. Only one obstacle is preventing May from winning Tory backing for her Brexit deal, writes Paul Goodman in a piece on the influential Conservative Home website, in which he imagines that the backstop was radically amended so that a “unilateral exit” mechanism was included.For now, however, he concludes:Her deal and the backstop march together in step. And admittedly, even with a right to unilateral exit, this government would be unlikely to exercise it if no deal waited on the other side of the door.Nonetheless, that exit would be there – which, ultimately, is what matters. We’ve said before that Brexit isn’t a still photo, but a moving film – or should be. Where Britain will be on day one isn’t where we will be in year ten. The backstop freezes that film and prevents it from playing. Provide a sure means of escape from it, and the film begins to roll. And May’s deal thus becomes acceptable.Unfortunately, there is vanishingly little prospect of that. The backstop lies between her and success like a hollow in the path of a runner. It is so narrow as almost to be leapable. But it plunges many, many miles deep.The DUP leader is on Twitter with a “we told you so” statement aimed squarely at the prime minister.You had almost forgotten about the Democratic Unionist party (DUP), hadn’t you? Its leader, Arlene Foster, has been talking to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, and it looks like May really has an uphill struggle to get the party back on board in terms of providing any parliamentary support.Despite the pictures of May remonstrating with Juncker, No 10 tried to sound a diplomatic tone this morning, arguing there was still time for the “dust to settle” and that there was a range of briefings emerging from EU leaders and officials. The prime minister is due to give a press conference at lunchtime to respond to last night’s EU rebuff.Here’s a clip of Theresa May and Jean Claude Juncker having what appears to be a less than cordial exchange this morning before the opening of the summit’s latest session. It’s really set tongues wagging in Brussels.Here’s the Irish taoiseach speaking on his arrival this morning in Brussels, via a tweet from Sky’s Mark Stone (that sound you might hear in the background is the grinding of Conservative MPs’ teeth):In other non-Brexit news (yes, it exists), Politics Home reports that the former head of the House of Commons standards and privileges committee “angrily confronted” Jeremy Corbyn after Labour blocked the appointment of its own MP Jess Phillips to the watchdog.PoliticsHome reported last month that the Birmingham Yardley MP had been nominated by Labour to take a seat on the committee, with the appointment even appearing on the House of Commons order paper on 19 November.Kevin Barron, who stepped down as chair of the committee this year, was said to have raised the issue with Labour’s chief whip, Nick Brown, at the party’s weekly meeting of MPs on Tuesday night, which Corbyn also attended.Fresh from his spat with fellow members of England’s 1986 World Cup squad, BBC Sport host Gary Lineker has now been criticised by his colleague Jonathan Agnew for expressing his political views on Twitter.The former England football captain, who hosts the BBC’s flagship Match of the Day programme, has been outspoken in his political opinions, in particular his opposition to Brexit, which he regularly tweets about. Lineker also appeared at a rally in London campaigning for a second referendum in November.Today’s bilateral between May and Macron – which is still going on – is particularly key given that France is one of the countries pushing hard against the prime minister’s idea of having a 12-month time limit on any Irish backstop. A grim-sounding No 10 official tried to remain upbeat in briefings, according to the ’s Dan Sabbagh.“There’s plenty to discuss,” said the official.The Labour party is floating proposals today to break up the big four accounting firms.Parliament’s Twitter account tweets a reminder of today’s historic significance:Theresa May is now meeting the french president, Emmanuel Macron, according to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg.Meanwhile, the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, appears to be continuing to shore up support for Ireland’s position:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1428581c83893d7f00e5c7b6ff00eb0eb294a63f/0_79_4763_2857/master/4763.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73a685cdbdf25752d5fbe64e97da29ee","title":"australia edge india as momentum swings on first day of second test","story":"Momentum swung violently on the first day of the second Test in Perth, where Australia’s most inexperienced batsmen stood up either side of an inspired fightback from India’s four-prong pace attack on a pitch that is already misbehaving.Australia reached 277-6 at stumps on Friday, when Aaron Finch and Marcus Harris’ diligent 112-run opening stand was followed by a collapse of 4-36 that highlighted the inconsistent bounce on offer.Travis Head steadied superbly for the second Test in a row, only to surrender late on 58 when he needlessly smashed the second new ball straight to Mohammed Shami in the deep.Tim Paine will resume on 16, keen to push Australia’s total well beyond 300 on a cracking green deck that will play no shortage of tricks when they bowl in the game’s final innings.A sensational one-handed slips catch from Virat Kohli removed Peter Handscomb for five and reduced Australia to 148-4, giving the touring bowlers’ hope of putting their feet up at some point on a day when the temperature hit 39.1 degrees.A dropped catch from chirpy keeper Rishabh Pant, remarkable for all the wrong reasons given it was a regulation edge offered by Shaun Marsh on 24, ensured that wouldn’t happen.Marsh failed to make the most of his reprieve, adding 21 runs, but the veteran’s 84-run stand with Head was comfortably better than any partnership Australia produced in their series-opening loss at Adelaide Oval.Both captains were keen to bat first, while acknowledging it would not be easy.Finch (50) and Harris (70) negotiated a wicket-less morning session, in which India’s quicks fluffed their lines early, to seemingly make a mockery of pre-match expectations of a WACA-like wicket .But the longer the day wore on, the more pace, bounce, fire and brimstone there was.Jasprit Bumrah trapped Finch lbw, igniting a fightback shortly after lunch with a sensational five-over spell of 1-3.Usman Khawaja’s series-long struggles to score freely continued when he was out for five off 38 balls, while Harris fell in scarcely believable fashion.Harris fended a delivery from offspinning allrounder Hanuma Vihari, which reared at him after hitting a crack, straight to Ajinkya Rahane at first slip.Vihari, the visitors’ frontline spinner in the absence of injured star Ravichandran Ashwin, also used bounce rather than turn to account for Marsh.Australia’s second 100-plus opening stand for the year in Test cricket came at an ideal time for Paine’s team, whose hopes of lifting the Border-Gavaskar trophy after a difficult nine months would be dashed with a loss in Perth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b51fe3342a19b9f985c81228cedaa01e3c21efe5/0_253_4748_2849/master/4748.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d9ba0fe724373eaf979e0f4528ef037","title":"eleven

Vicky Featherstone, Richard Eyre and Charles Saumarez Smith discuss the tricky business of artistic changeWhat a difference a name makes. Earlier this year the Tricycle theatre in north London announced that it would be rebranding itself as the Kiln when it opened after redevelopment. There were petitions calling for the theatre to revert to its former title placard-wielding protesters gathered on the street to demonstrate against the artistic director, Indhu Rubasingham. A letter to the  decried the change as throwing away “a valuable legacy and history”. Twisting the knife, two of the theatre’s former heads, Nicolas Kent and Ken Chubb, signed it.Even by the self-dramatising standards of British theatre, the controversy seems somewhat mystifying. There’s barely a theatre in the country that hasn’t changed its name at some point. No one was proposing the Tricycle – or Kiln – be closed down, and indeed after a £5.5m makeover it looks better than ever. This isn’t even the first time the theatre has taken on a new identity: it began life nearly five decades ago as the Wakefield Tricycle Company.Defending the decision to rebrand, Rubasingham – who has run the theatre since 2012 – explained in interviews that she and colleagues simply felt that it was time for a new start to match their freshly refurbished building (plus many audiences assumed, wrongly, that the Tricycle was a children’s theatre). The theatre is in Kilburn “Kiln” seemed an apt choice.But opponents refuse to be mollified, and, eight months after it started, the affair – somewhat improbably – rumbles on. A website called It’s Our Tricycle sprang up, proclaiming that the theatre “is being rebranded entirely against the wishes of local residents” (the theatre mildly pointed out that in fact public consultations had gone on for several months). A few weeks ago, protesters picketed the theatre again, this time at the press night of an adaptation of Zadie Smith’s White Teeth. They were joined by that veteran controversialist Ken Livingstone.Over and above the fortunes of a small, if influential, north London theatre, the case raises intriguing questions. What happens when an organisation decides to make a fresh start, or change artistic direction? Is it possible to evolve and still stay true to your past? Most of all: what happens when you do something that your audience – at least a small and vocal part of it, including your predecessors – really detests? In other words, do legacy and history matter? And who gets to decide?One person who has little time for the nay-sayers is Vicky Featherstone, who runs the Royal Court theatre in central London. “Everything has to change,” she says briskly when we speak. “Theatre is a live art form. You hold things back at your peril.”Would Featherstone ever criticise a decision taken by her successor? “God, no. Arts organisations are publicly funded. We don’t own the theatre or gallery we’re just s. You either need to support what they’re doing or back off. Go and drink sangria in Spain.”Richard Eyre, who took over the National Theatre from the domineering, larger-than-life Peter Hall in 1987, concurs: “I don’t think you should make trouble for your successor. As Stanley Baldwin said, once you leave the bridge, you leave. You don’t spit on the deck.”Featherstone was the founding artistic director of the National Theatre of Scotland as the company came into being in 2004. Challenging as it was to create a troupe from scratch, this paled in comparison with her arrival at the Court in 2013. She was taking over from Dominic Cooke, whose tenure was garlanded by a long run of critical and commercial successes, and some observers wondered how she could possibly do things better.“Dominic was massively supportive, and I only had respect for what he’d done. But you also have to think about what to do differently. As tightropes go, it’s really tight,” she says.Eyre remembers with pinpoint clarity what it was like trying to turn the National, the largest of theatrical supertankers, in another direction while battling hostile critics. “When it’s working, it’s great, but when it’s not, it’s brutal,” he says. “When you have, say, a couple of shows in the Olivier theatre that haven’t caught light, you can feel the morale and the cash draining away. Then you get a hit and the weather changes. But that’s the point, in a way: it’s empirical. Your policy as an artistic director is the shows you choose to do and the people you get to do them. That’s how you show what your organisation is about.”It isn’t just in theatres that such issues hold sway, of course. Organisations of all kinds, from community choirs to multinational tech giants, grapple with issues surrounding leadership and regime change. In the art world, Maria Balshaw’s takeover of Tate last year after Nicholas Serota’s 29-year tenure has been scrutinised for signs of what Balshaw is doing differently (more focus on ersity and female artists, it seems, and a less remote management style).Charles Saumarez Smith, who has run no fewer than three major British museums – he is leaving the Royal Academy after 11 years, having previously headed the National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery – agrees that taking over from a leader who is much-loved can be the trickiest of challenges. “I had that at the National Gallery, certainly. Neil MacGregor, who was there before me, was brilliant and I had a hard time competing with that, looking back. The problem is that people expect you to be the same. And that’s the one thing you can’t be.”How did he deal with it? “Those old adages ring true. Get to know the place. Make time to meet everyone in the organisation, from top to bottom. And keep your objectives in mind: what do you want to achieve in your first 100 days? How do you want to leave your mark?”A huge amount comes down to personalities, he says. “It’s like football teams. You’ve learned what it’s like to manage Oxford United, but you can’t do the same with Arsenal. And sometimes the more outwardly similar organisations are, the more different they are internally. It’s almost a point of pride.”How about looking at it from the other side – has Featherstone ever had mixed feelings about organisations she has moved on from, especially when they have changed direction? “You feel things, but what’s important is to never try and judge inidual decisions – it’s to do with taste, time, pragmatism. Change happens, and yes it can feel like rejection. But theatre is full of rejection: as artistic directors we’ve probably rejected everybody at one time or another.”Across at the National Theatre, Rufus Norris’s decision to showcase edgier and more experimental work, though it has built up a fanbase, initially offended some people accustomed to the glossier shows commissioned by his predecessor, Nicholas Hytner. Hytner may have stayed publicly quiet about his predecessor’s choices – unlike Nicolas Kent and the Kiln – but he did decide to set up a new theatre of his own just down the South Bank, in what looked teasingly like an attempt to poach the National’s former audience.Eyre argues that, just as such contrasts are inevitable, it’s the job of a new artistic director to create them. “You’re always going to upset some people. Your job is to exercise your preferences and make choices.”For Featherstone, the issue is bigger still – one of ersity. “That’s what equality means, at least to me. In order for people to gain, other people sometimes have to lose.”It’s crucial for artistic directors to focus not only on their own tenure and ambitions, but to plan for what comes next for the organisation: to put it somewhat brutally, the most difficult bit of the job might be arranging for your own disappearance.“People talk a lot about leadership, that’s obvious,” says Saumarez Smith. “But really, transition is the issue – you always have to be thinking about how to hand on the baton, how to make sure you’re leaving things in good shape.”How does he feel about moving on from the RA after 11 years at the helm? “When you leave an organisation, a bit of you thinks: what a gigantic relief. You live with it every moment of the day. The people, the money, the politics, the policy – they’re a part of your life. But I have no doubt I’ll miss the RA immensely.”Says Featherstone: “I never want to leave this place, but one day I will. Everyone who has the honour of running one of these extraordinary institutions needs to be thinking about succession planning, not holding on. That’s part of the job, too.”Ultimately, adds Eyre, the art is what matters. What surely counts isn’t what a building is called, or shows it staged 10 or 20 years ago, but what’s happening in the here and now. “For all that theatre lives in the memory, it’s always moving. Try as you might, you can’t stop that.”The rebranded Kiln, certainly, is unlikely to go back. Though complaints about the name-change rumble on, audiences appear to be welcoming the new beginning. According to the theatre, nearly half the people who have booked for the reopening season have never bought a ticket there before. And despite mixed reviews, its adaptation of Zadie Smith’s White Teeth has become the fastest-selling and most financially successful production in the company’s history. Names come and go, but another adage holds true: there’s no such thing as bad publicity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d16f1baa42848086581eec715d14587ea317697/0_0_2853_1712/master/2853.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47969a859d56d75d5d9857be65d4bda3","title":"the 12 saves of christmas an expert survival guide","story":"From emergency gift ideas to master mixology – via Jackson Boxer’s ballotine and Patrick Grant’s suit – experts share their must-haves and must-dos for surviving the festive season 1.

If in doubt, I now reach for Home Alone – guaranteed laughs for all ages – or White Christmas, which has that reassuring retro glow.”Smith has hosted private film events as part of the La Maison Rémy Martin members’ club2. Tim Halilaj, award-winning mixologist“People always run out of ice at Christmas parties, so the night before just fill your freezer with plastic containers of water and then hack these bergs into rugged lumps – they’re more on-trend than cubes. For totally clear ice, boil tap water, let it cool and then freeze it.”3. Shona Vertue, personal trainer (and David Beckham’s yoga teacher)“The gym seems like a distant memory over Christmas, but it doesn’t have to be that way. Type ‘HIIT’ into YouTube and do a 30-minute home workout, using nothing but your body weight to induce sweat and burn Christmas dinner calories. If nothing else, it gives you a break from the family for half an hour!”4. Garrett Moore, party planner and co-founder of Immersive Cult“Go for candlelight, scattered lamps and dim light. Some people feel self-conscious at parties and they don’t want to feel like they’re being watched, so low lighting is very conducive to good times. And create welcoming spaces where people can sit somewhere quiet and have a nice conversation if they want to. Maybe have a mistletoe area or create a little grotto-type nook. It’s nice for guests to feel like they have options and places to explore.”“I also have a bottle of Rémy Martin. I serve it with pickled cockle popcorn – it’s a fantastic pairing – with clove or orange added to the cognac to give it a seasonal twist.”Try Bosi’s cognac and pickled cockle pairing (and other seasonal cognac cocktails and food pairings) at Rémy Martin residency at Claude Bosi at Bibendum6. Polly Hadden-Paton, professional organiser to Suki Waterhouse and Lily Allen“I like to keep a few nice bottles, scented candles or tins of biscuits wrapped up in a drawer as fallback presents in case someone unexpectedly buys you something. And if they’re not claimed, that’s even better, as you can just enjoy them yourself.”7. Wrapologist Kirsten Westlake, from gift-wrapping service Wrapsody“Double-sided Sellotape is my secret weapon. It’s invisible and makes the finished product appear super slick. Most people come unstuck by using too much paper, which causes bulky, messy folds. The secret is to measure before you cut and use just enough paper to meet by about a centimetre.”8. Candice Brathwaite, parenting blogger“One tried-and-tested Christmas save if you’ve got a house full of children is advent stockings. I put them up on 1 December – containing 24 tiny, totally inexpensive gifts. The most important thing is that they aren’t allowed to open their advent presents until the end of the day, so it’s the perfect bribe to try and keep them in order until the evening.”9. Patrick Grant, fashion designer“If you’re having a suit tailored, have them cut you an evening suit with both a dress vest and a cummerbund. By this simple expedient, you can wear the same suit throughout the Christmas party season. Just switch between the two, change up your pocket hanky and, hey presto, with one suit you will look subtly different but always impeccable.”Grant has hosted private fashion events as part of the La Maison Rémy Martin members’ club10. Florist Anna Potter, from Swallows and Damsons“Bowls of one kind of fruit such as apples, figs, pomegranates or pears on a table make great centrepieces. Any fruit or vegetable that has an interesting shape, colour or texture looks amazing and harks back to Christmas being about feasting. And a sprig of rosemary looks beautiful on a place setting and also smells great. Or sneak some foliage from the garden and wrap it into a leafy circle to make a mini wreath for each guest.”11. Jackson Boxer, chef and restaurateur, St Leonards and Brunswick House“I make up a large ballotine of cured foie gras loaded with black truffles and brandy. It’s good to have on hand to quell appetites if anything goes wrong and causes any delays, or anyone shows up unexpectedly. And it’s outrageously delicious smeared on top of butter-fried cold Christmas pudding – a sentiment heartily endorsed by both chefs Fergus Henderson and Jeremy Lee, who know about such things.”12. Sam Lyle, co-founder of Pines and Needles“So many people order trees that are way too big for their room and have to hack bits off. The width of the tree is typically a third of the height, so be realistic about how much space you want it to take up. Trees are like flowers, they need water to stay fresh, so give your tree up to a litre of water every couple of days for the first few days, and then a litre once a week after that.”Whether you need to impress last-minute guests with some fun, festive cocktails or take Hadden-Paton’s advice and stock up on a few bottles of something smart to keep as emergency gifts, Rémy Martin could just be your ultimate seasonal save – the key ingredient to Bosi’s cocktail menu, the perfect accompaniment to pickled cockle popcorn (of course) and a rather elegant gift"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29183fbc69ae8c99a64004797697aeb9ca67dd87/0_315_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e496846af42c7313821eb685e53f0279","title":"from bach to bauhaus discover the culture of thuringia germany","story":"Immerse yourself in the German artistic gems that changed how we see the worldThuringia is the cultural heart of Germany, a place of inspiration for world-famous artists, writers, musicians and intellectuals. Remarkably, much of Thuringia’s cobbled streets and old stone architecture has barely changed since the time of Bach et al, so as well as touring the many museums devoted to these famous creative and intellectual figures, you have the opportunity to literally walk in their footsteps. Start right here ...Johann Sebastian Bach: baroque brought to lifeGermany’s greatest baroque composer was a jobbing musician throughout his life, and Thuringia is full of traces of his industrious career. Bach was an organist at Arnstadt, but his legacy is celebrated at the annual Thuringian Bach Festival in spring, and Eisenach (where he was born, in 1685) boasts the world’s biggest Bach museum. Housed in a splendid medieval building, the Bach House is devoted to the Bach dynasty – not only Johann Sebastian, but also his numerous musical relatives. The house is full of artefacts from Bach’s life and times, and each visit includes a short concert, played on original baroque-period instruments. If you’re a fan of classical music, you’ll also want to visit the Liszt House in nearby Weimar, where the great Hungarian composer Franz Liszt lived and worked.Martin Luther: the father of ReformationLuther spent his teenage years in Thuringia, first as a schoolboy in Eisenach, and then as a student at the University of Erfurt, graduating with an MA from its faculty of arts. While he was a student, Luther lived in Erfurt’s Augustinian Monastery (open to visitors – you can even stay the night). However, the most spectacular Luther site is Wartburg Castle, near Eisenach, where Luther hid, in disguise, from 1521 to 1522, and translated the New Testament into German – cementing the Reformation and establishing German as a national language. You can visit the room where Luther wrote his meisterwerk, where there used to be an ink stain on the wall – no longer visible – supposedly made when Luther threw an inkpot at the devil, who was trying to distract him.Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: the master of all tradesIt’s hard to overstate quite how important Goethe is to German culture. Poet, playwright, novelist, philosopher and scientist, his genius encompassed virtually every avenue of German intellectual life. Born in Frankfurt in 1749, he came to Thuringia as a young man, fresh from the success of his sensational first novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther, and spent time in Erfurt, Jena and Gotha, before settling in Weimar. The baroque house, where he lived for 50 years, until his death in 1832, is now the Goethe National Museum. There are lots of other sites associated with Goethe all over Thuringia, from the Liebhabertheatre in Kochberg Castle to the Botanical Garden in Jena.Lucas Cranach (Elder and Younger): Renaissance father and sonLucas Cranach is one of Germany’s most celebrated painters, and Thuringia is full of paintings by this Renaissance master and his son. Lucas the Elder was the better painter, but his son was almost as good, and their styles are so similar that it’s often hard to tell them apart. Born in 1472, Cranach the Elder settled in Weimar near the end of his life to live with his son’s family, and his adopted hometown is full of mementoes of his life and work. There are plenty of paintings by both Cranachs in Weimar’s Castle Museum, but the crowning glory is the magnificent altarpiece in the Church of St Peter \u0026amp St Paul, started by Cranach the Elder and completed by his son. If you’re travelling around Thuringia, don’t miss the Friedenstein Palace in Gotha and the city’s art museum in Erfurt, which both have fine Cranach collections, and St John’s Church in Neustadt an der Orla, with its precious altarpiece. However, the most atmospheric setting for Cranach’s moody masterpieces is Wartburg Castle, where Cranach’s good friend Martin Luther hid away. The castle contains several acute portraits of Luther by Cranach the Elder, as well as some intimate, perceptive studies of Luther’s parents and his wife.Walter Gropius: founder of BauhausModernist architect Walter Gropius was born in Berlin in 1883, but it was in Thuringia that he made his name. In 1919 in Weimar, he founded the Bauhaus – a revolutionary design school that transformed the way we live today. Gropius taught his students to work across a wide range of disciplines – from pottery to printmaking, and carpentry to ceramics. He taught them to throw out the chintz, to see that less is more. His house style was stark, minimal and, above all, practical. Everything he made was fit for purpose. His ideas have since become commonplace, but in the 1920s they were shocking. In 1925, local conservatives drove him out of Weimar, and when the Nazis came to power he was forced to flee abroad. Yet, here in Thuringia, his influence lives on. Next year, bauhaus museum weimar marks the centenary of the Bauhaus with a move to a smart new building – a fitting forum for the world’s oldest Bauhaus collection. There are plenty of other Bauhaus sites elsewhere in Thuringia, including the Haus Auerbach in Jena, built by Gropius, and a Bauhaus-era hotel, the Haus des Volkes, in Probstzella.Carl Zeiss: a new visionBorn in Weimar in 1816, Zeiss trained as a fine machinist in Thuringia, and in 1846 he opened a workshop in Jena, making telescopes, microscopes and other optical devices. By the time he died, in 1888, his little workshop had grown into a large factory. By the beginning of the first world war, it was the largest camera manufacturer in the world. After the second world war, the Soviets stripped the factory bare, and took much of the equipment back to Russia, but although it ended up behind the iron curtain, Zeiss held its own against western competition – and when Germany was reunified it was one of the few East German firms to survive and prosper as a viable concern.

He told the audience that, while he was “off to new pastures”, it was “not goodbye, but goodnight”.Dimbleby used his final moments in the chair to thank his colleagues on the production staff, particularly those who select venues and audiences, whom he said had a particularly difficult job.He also thanked the audience members, who gave him a standing ovation. He told them they were some of the more than 100,000 people to have participated in the programme during his tenure.The audiences have “exercised what I think is a really important democratic right, putting questions to the panel and to argue with each other, as you have been tonight”, he said.Closing the debate after the final question, on the rules that should or should not govern comedy, Dimbleby could not help poking fun at one of his guests, the former Brexit secretary David Davis. “Have you got a joke about Brexit for us?” he asked. “I was going to say some people might think you are the joke about Brexit.”Dimbleby is by far Question Time’s longest serving presenter, having started on 13 January 1994. He was preceded by Peter Sissons, who chaired the programme between 1989 and 1993, and Robin Day from 1979 to 1989.Davis’ fellow guests on the final programme were the Green MP Caroline Lucas, the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, the comedian Jo Brand and the former education secretary Nicky Morgan.Ahead of his final appearance, prominent political figures paid tribute to Dimbleby’s time as Question Time presenter, which ned the tenures of five prime ministers.“David Dimbleby’s become the voice of Britain, really ... Yet, he’s able to convert very easily from that to chairing what has become an increasingly obstreperous programme,” the former Lib Dem leader Menzies Campbell told BBC Radio 5 Live’s Question Time Extra Time.He said Dimbleby brought in more audience participation during his tenure than previous presenters, but that sometimes made his job more difficult.On the same programme, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, recounted a recent occasion when she said Dimbleby “came down on me like a ton of bricks and I was thinking: ‘What side of the bed did you get out this morning?’”Thornberry said Dimbleby was able to admonish his guests while still being a “bit flirtatious”.Ken Clarke, however, said he had never been shown that particular side of the presenter. “He’s just an A-star journalist and he’s made this programme very much the David Dimbleby show.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Vandalism of Tony McLoughlin\u0026rsquos Sligo office comes after passage of abortion legislationMan in custody following suspected murder in WaterfordGarda\u0026iacute were called to three incidents overnight including an attempt to burn a shop unitHijack happened in the Termonfeckin Road areaSpot flooding expected as parts of the north and west to experience delugeCost estimates for facility at St James\u0026rsquos Hospital spiralling from 2012\u0026rsquos \u0026euro404mCommissioner to recruit 600 new garda\u0026iacute, and increase numbers on frontline dutyImpact of homelessness \u0026lsquoa child welfare issue\u0026rsquo, says Focus Ireland reportHousing crisis means mothers often have to spend much longer in residential treatmentAction is statute barred, abuse of process and vexatious, Galway businessman arguesLegal proceedings could be taken over alleged delay in putting child into careLaw Society moves to freeze bank accounts of Ballaghaderreen-based Declan O\u0026rsquoCallaghanStudents frustrated by \u0026lsquoteething problems\u0026rsquo which led to tests being delayedThe Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy Bill will now go to the PresidentLong meeting with May reiterates stance of not reopening withdrawal treaty for UKFrank Durcan and Cyril Burke investigated by State ethics watchdog over Castlebar landChina accuses some of richest nations of backsliding on pollution clean-up promisesArchbishop of Dublin Michael Jackson highlights \u0026lsquochurch of the whole island\u0026rsquo"},{"url":null,"title":"charity prints from the irish times","story":" photographers have produced a gallery of images that will make a unique Christmas gift.

Photograph: Geert VandenAPTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said the European Union is as one on the need for a Border backstop in Brexit withdrawal agreement. Mr Varadkar said the controversial issue was not just of concern to the Irish, as fellow EU leaders saw the measure as vital to protect the integrity of the European single market.In Brussels for the second day of the European Council meeting, Mr Varadkar said he was “very satisfied” with the summit conclusions on Brexit which made clear the withdrawal agreement was not “up for renegotiation”.The Taoiseach said he still believed a no deal was an “unlikely scenario” despite the EU ramping up preparations for such an eventuality.“As Europe, we reaffirmed our commitment for the need for a backstop,” he said.“An open Border between Northern Ireland and Ireland can’t be a backdoor to the single market.“That’s why European countries also very strongly support backstop. It is not just an Irish issue, it is very much a European issue as well.“It is very much a case of the European Union being one-for-all and all-for-one.”The backstop, which will come into effect if a wider trade deal between the UK and EU fails to materialise during the transition period after Brexit next March, will see Northern Ireland adhere to a range of EU regulatory rules in order to facilitate free-flowing trade and movement across the Border.British prime minister Theresa May is facing widespread opposition to the measure at Westminster amid claims it will undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom by creating an economic border between Northern Ireland and Britain. European Union leaders on Thursday rejected Mrs May’s plea to redefine the Border backstop, insisting the guarantee of no hard border in Ireland cannot be renegotiated.The European Council on Thursday night refused to give the British prime minister the legal assurances she sought that the backstop would be temporary. Leaders also deleted from their draft conclusions a reference to being “ready to examine whether any further assurance can be provided”.Mr Varadkar said the issue could not be deferred to the trade talks post-withdrawal.“It’s not just an Irish issue, it’s a European issue,” he said.“It’s about protecting the peace, keeping the Border open, also protecting the single market and making sure we answer this question of the Irish Border now, so no side can use it as leverage in the future relationship talks, which we are willing to start as soon as the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified.”The Taoiseach said while the EU was willing to offer “clarifications or explanations” to Mrs May, he reiterated that a renegotiation of the deal was not an option.Speaking to journalists on Thursday evening, the president of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker said it would be up to the UK to “say what they want”, not for the leaders to propose solutions. He appeared to leave open the possibility the UK could come back with proposed legal text in January.Amid growing impatience on the part of the EU 27 with the UK’s approach to the negotiations, EU leaders hardened language on the backstop that had appeared in an earlier draft of the summit conclusions.“We don’t want the UK to think there can be any form of renegotiation whatsoever,” said Mr Juncker. But EU leaders said they gave Mrs May assurances they would seek to agree a new deal with Britain by 2021 so that the backstop was never triggered.The leaders said they wanted to underline that the backstop was “intended as an insurance policy”. They said they were determined to “work speedily on a subsequent agreement that establishes by December 31st, 2020, alternative arrangements, so that the backstop will not need to be triggered.” - PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Yves HermanReutersEU leaders last night delivered a pointed snub to beleaguered British prime minister Theresa May.They gave her political assurances that they see the backstop as a temporary measure, but refused to craft a legally binding declaration to that effect as she had sought. The leaders removed from a draft of the European Council conclusions a suggestion that they were “ready to examine whether any further assurance can be provided”.The amendment does not mean that they will not provide such assurances, but, as European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said “it is up to the British government to say what they want”.It is expected that London will want to return in January with proposed wording for consideration by the council of any protocol, declaration, or clarification which it might like attached to the withdrawal treaty.The leaders did provide some comfort to May. The conclusions say that they “stand ready to embark on preparations immediately after signature of the Withdrawal Agreement to ensure that negotiations can start as soon as possible after the UK’s withdrawal. . . It is the union’s firm determination to work speedily on a subsequent agreement that establishes by 31st December, 2020, alternative arrangements, so that the backstop will not need to be triggered.“The European Council also underlines that, if the backstop were nevertheless to be triggered, it would apply temporarily, unless and until it is superseded by a subsequent agreement that ensures that a hard border is avoided.”The text adds the explicit reference to the avoidance of a hard border. “In such a case,” the conclusions continue, “the union would use its best endeavours to negotiate and conclude expeditiously a subsequent agreement that would replace the backstop, and would expect the same of the United Kingdom, so that the backstop would only be in place for as long as strictly necessary.”The draft was also amended to remove from that last sentence a reference to only being “in place for a short period” – the deletion reflects sensitivities by the Irish among others to any suggestion that the backstop would be time-limited.They said that they wish to establish as close as possible a partnership with the United Kingdom in the future. And the leaders emphasised the need to step up “work on preparedness at all levels for the consequences of the UK’s withdrawal to be intensified, taking into account all possible outcomes.” With or without a deal.Echoing\u0026nbspJuncker’s sentiments Danish prime minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen on his way out of the meeting placed firm responsibility for the next step on the House of Commons.“Someday – somebody needs to say it. And you have to say – openly – that it is necessary that you get some homework done in the British parliament which has handled this challenge very different to what Denmark did, when the Danes voted No to Maastricht or as the Irish did when they voted No to Lisbon.“In both countries someone took the responsibility on them to decide what do we do. In both Denmark and Ireland somebody took upon themselves to say what can unite us on our country and what should we ask from Europe. And here you need to say openly that it is that need you have in the United Kingdom now.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

But the firm’s plans have been delayed by numerous setbacks and the loss of the company’s previous space plane in a 2014 accident that killed co-pilot Michael Alsbury.“We’ve had our challenges,” said Mr Whitesides. “But to get to the point where we are at least in range of space flight is a big deal.”Sir Richard Branson with Virgin Galactic\u0026#39s space tourism rocketVirgin Galactic’s site, high in the Mojave Desert 100 miles north of Los Angeles, was abuzz with excitement on Wednesday, as the launch time crept closer.As Sir Richard made tea for the team, Mr Whiteside explained that the two pilots will take off at dawn and attempt to fly to 50 miles above the Earth – Nasa’s definition of space.Their craft, VSS Unity, will eventually hold six paying passengers, but on Thursday it will be just the two test pilots, plus a series of scientific instruments, and “Annie”, a mannequin fitted with sensors to study the effect of the journey on the body.“She’s coming along for the ride,” joked Mike Moses, president of Virgin Galactic, as he showed off for the first time the delicate pre-flight preparations on the eve of the launch. Virgin has never before permitted access to the hangar prior to a test flight.Dozens of technicians were making final checks on Wednesday, inspecting the screws in both VSS Unity and the mothership, VMS Eve, and torque testing the panels.Earlier the test pilots had carried out a final trial run inside the simulator – a black-curtained cockpit in the corner of the hangar, where the curved screen provided a breathtaking vision of what the pilots would see from 50 miles above earth, as the atmosphere ends and the darkness of space begins.The hangar hummed with quiet focus the team of 750 employees excited for the challenge of the next day.“We are essentially learning how to best fly the trajectory to space,” said Mr Whitesides. “The craft will be flown to space – it’s not computer driven. So we’re learning the best piloting techniques.”At 7am ET (midday GMT) on Thursday, if conditions are right, VMS Eve – named after Sir Richard’s mother – will take off with VSS Unity attached. Climbing for around 45 minutes to a height of around 43,000ft, VSS Unity will then be released from VMS Eve. The pilots will pull the nose of the space craft sharply upwards for around 50 seconds – longer than ever before – and jet into the skies with a force approaching Mach three, travelling at almost three times the speed of sound.At its maximum height, the pilots will turn the craft upside down, so that the eventual passengers, weightless by now, can see the Earth below them. For several minutes they will stay at that height, taking in the view of 500 miles in every direction, before beginning the descent.VSS Unity, the Virgin Galactic space craft, is hoped to be piloted into space for the first time on Thursday“Gliding back down is relaxed – a nice welcome back to Earth,” said Todd Ericson, the vice president of safety and test, and a former F-16 fighter jet pilot who is also one of the test pilots.The most challenging part, he said, was the pivot upwards to go into space.“If this flight is relatively successful, I think we’ll be in a position to go to a full-duration flight,” added Mr Whitesides.Virgin Galactic has not set a date for its first commercial space flight, for which around 700 people, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks and Justin Bieber have signed up, paying $250,000 (£192,000).Virgin Galactic\u0026#39s mothership, VMS Eve, carries VSS Unity for its first flight, over Mojave on Thursday September 8, 2016But many people expect it to happen within a year, and Sir Richard has said he will be on the first trip, leaving the company’s New Mexico spaceport.Virgin Galactic’s main rival, Blue Origin, owned by billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has flown higher, but in a computer-operated craft, rather than one piloted by humans. They too are hoping to take their first commercial passengers in 2019.SpaceX, the company owned by Elon Musk, is focused on carrying equipment for Nasa’s programmes – although they do hope to take a Japanese billionaire around the moon by 2023.“This is a test flight, a no-kidding test flight, with all the novelty and excitement and risk,” said Mr Whitesides, on the eve of the flight.He was determined, he said, “to share that risk is a valuable part of forward progress.”The pilots may not decide to push for space on Thursday, and the conditions may not be right.

Pristina government officials said the process would last at least 10 years.Kosovo\u0027s independence came almost a decade after a NATO air war halted a two-year counter-insurgency war by Serbian security forces that included arrests, killings and expulsions of ethnic Albanian civilians.Reflecting Washington\u0027s position as the biggest ally of Kosovo Albanians, U.S. Ambassador Philip Kosnett said Friday\u0027s vote was “historic” for Kosovo and pledged full U.S. support.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said last week that the idea of creating a Kosovo army goes against the advice of many NATO allies and may have serious repercussions for Kosovo\u0027s future Euro-Atlantic integration. Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Theresa May confronts Jean-Claude Juncker as trip to Brussels backfiresMiddle-class drug users should not be treated leniently, Lord Chief Justice says as he warns it is fuelling knife crimeFiancee of former soldier sentenced in Turkey for fighting Isil hopes they can now marry after he skips bail and returns to BritainRoyals release Christmas cards - including a new wedding photo and playful Prince GeorgeDeer smashes through window of Arkansas courthouseWinter solstice: Why pagans celebrate the shortest day of the year (a day late) With the confidence vote option gone, here is what Jacob Rees-Mogg and his fellow Brexiteers can do nextIslamic State driven from last town as US-backed forces leave caliphate on brinkStephen Lawrence murder suspect Jamie Acourt attacked in prison days into drugs sentenceVirgin Galactic successfully sends test pilots into spaceWhat is the Brexit deal, and what will happen if Theresa May loses the vote in Parliament?Strasbourg shooting suspect shot dead by policeWhat is the Brexit backstop, and why has it delayed the vote in Parliament?Strictly Come Dancing: who will win the final?Vietnam \u0026#39interested\u0026#39 in hosting next US-North Korea summitBrexit latest: Theresa May\u0026#39s trip to Brussels backfires as EU grows frustrated with PM Hollywood\u0026#39s leading ladies beat men at the box officeThousands of children\u0026#39s lives could be saved after hospital discharge, study findsHow the no-confidence vote gives Theresa May effective Brexit parliamentary minority Comment: I had no choice but to join the rebellion against Mrs MayWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 14 december 2018","story":"The Nutcracker performed by The English National Ballet at the London Coliseum.

As a result, rents are expected to rise “modestly” over the next year, RICS said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

HoF knocked nearly £32m off the top.\u0026nbspThe, um, ‘Harrods of the High Street’, as Ashley has sought to brand his new toy, is proving every bit as pricey as the famous Knightsbridge department store to its new owner.Other Ashley bets, notably Debenhams, caused more pain in the form write downs totalling nearly £77m. He also has substantial stakes in Findel, French Connection, Game Digital, Goals Soccer Centres and the Iconix Brand Group. And he\u0026nbspbought Evans Cycles from its administrators too.\u0026nbspAll this at a time when the core Sports Direct business has held up remarkably well. Yes UK sales fell a little bit (0.2 per cent), but given the current retail climate that counts as a pretty good result.\u0026nbspIt often seems as if Ashley enjoys the practice of putting a pistol to his feet and emptying the clip into them. Yet there is a counter argument.Despite the money lavished on top business executives, they’re as inclined to groupthink as anyone else.\u0026nbspThe current consensus holds that department stores are doomed, the high street needs radical surgery, and there will be more retailers beating a path to administrators\u0027 doors\u0026nbspover the\u0026nbspcoming year.

But he probably knows he’s not going to get it.\u0026nbspYet he’s still ploughing on at a time when no one else seems to want\u0026nbspto.\u0026nbspIt’s incredibly difficult to see him pulling it off.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

As a result, rents are expected to rise “modestly” over the next year, RICS said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Mike Ashley’s discount retailer increased revenue by 4.5 per cent, to £1.79bn from £1.72bn, in the first half of the financial year, while underlying profits fell by 27 per cent. The company said its earnings before income, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) rose 15.5 per cent to £180.3m excluding the effects of the House of Fraser purchase.

Mr Ashley has previously said he hopes to save the majority of House of Fraser stores, and has blamed ‘greedy landlords’\u0026nbspfor blocking his attempts to negotiate lower rents in order to keep branches open. Sports Direct cutting off nose to spite face with retail invesmentsMike Ashley tells MPs: ‘The internet is killing the high street’House of Fraser customers’ anger as gift cards no longer validHouse of Fraser flagship store on Oxford Street saved from closureOn Thursday, he said: “I have made my views clear that I believe the previous House of Fraser senior management team traded the business whilst it was insolvent for a long time.\u0026nbspThis means we have significant challenges ahead in turning House of Fraser around. “However, I genuinely believe we have acquired a fantastic opportunity and with the efforts of Sports Direct and House of Fraser teams, and the support of the brands, local councils and landlords, we can turn House of Fraser into the Harrods of the High Street.”Mr Ashley recently told MPs on the Housing, Communities and Local Government committee that most UK high streets are beyond help, and called for a tax on online retailers. When the committee asked him whether he could keep all of the House of Fraser branches open, Mr Ashley replied: “What person could keep 59 stores open – beside God? It’s impossible, it can’t be done.”Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at Fidelity International, said: “Replica football strips and cut-price trainers have helped Sport Direct buck the downward trend on the high street, with sales up 4 per cent over the period. However, its quest to turn the House of Fraser stores it’s acquired into the “Harrods of the high street” comes at a cost.“As a result, full-year earnings growth is expected to come in lower than last year. Whether investors will be able to look past the headline figures and see Sports Direct as a true diamond in the rough remains to be seen.”Sports Direct shares dipped by 1 per cent in early trading.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

According to the letter, obtained by the , Mr Ashley offered Debenhams a £40m interest-free loan, which was rejected. In his message, the Sports Direct owner said: “November was the worst November for retailers in living memory.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialCan Mike Ashley turn around the high street when no one else is tryingMike Ashley tells MPs: ‘The internet is killing the high street’Sports Direct set for stormy AGM but Mike Ashley will win in the end“Additionally it is speculated that the company currently has a zero chance of survival.”Earlier this year, Debenhams announced plans to close up to 50 shops, putting 4,000 jobs at risk. The cuts are being made in an attempt to slash costs, after the company reported its biggest ever loss of £492m in the year to 1 September. Sports Direct currently holds 29.7 per cent of Debenhams, just shy of the 30 per cent threshold at which an offer for the remainder of the company must be made, according to the UK takeover code. Mr Ashley said in his letter that he was concerned that the Debenhams board “doesn’t really seem to appreciate” the position that the company is in “and their responsibility to shareholders”. He added: “Sports Direct is Debenhams’ largest shareholder. What we are offering is a very public statement of support at a critical time for the Debenhams business.”The letter concluded with a request that Mr Bucher reconsider the offer of a loan, and respond by “lunch time Friday”. A spokesperson for Debenhams said: “We welcome Sports Direct’s proposal as a clear demonstration of their willingness to support the company. “However, as the offer came with conditions that could affect the interests of other stakeholders, while the board does not think it could accept the proposal, as presented, it has invited Sports Direct to engage as part of our broader refinancing process.”Shares in Debenhams were down 4.89 per cent to 5.45 at close of trading on Thursday, while Sports Direct’s stock tumbled by 14.8 per cent to 235.40. Earlier in the day, Sports Direct issued a trading update for the first half and revealed that House of Fraser had lost £31.5m in the first 11 weeks after the discount retailer bought it out of administration.Sports Direct also recently purchased Evans Cycles from its administrators.

Newtownabbey, County Antrim, Northern Ireland“Some argue it is actually increasing in intensity,” astronomy blogger Dave\u0026nbspSamuhel\u0026nbsptold the website.The key to the\u0026nbspGeminids’ consistency is the celestial object that has triggered the meteor shower each year since the\u0026nbsp1800s, which orbits the Sun every 550 days or so.3. It’s named after the Gemini constellationThe\u0026nbspGeminids’ name is no accident: once it enters Earth’s atmosphere, the meteor shower seems to be coming from the Gemini constellation.In order to spot the\u0026nbspGeminid\u0026nbspmeteor shower, you should thus be looking towards the Gemini constellation, which is well positioned from\u0026nbsp10pm, the American Meteor Society explained.This gives the\u0026nbspGeminids\u0026nbspa rare status as a major shower experiencing significant activity before midnight.4. It’s also linked to a Greek godSo what exactly causes the\u0026nbspGeminid meteor shower? A celestial object called 3200\u0026nbspPhatheon\u0026nbsp– which is also the son of the solar deity Helios in Greek mythology.It belongs to the Apollo asteroid group, an ensemble of near-Earth asteroids.As 3200\u0026nbspPhatheon, it is followed by a trail of debris. Earth passes through its trail each year, resulting in the display.5. As many as 100 shooting stars are expected to light up the skyThe\u0026nbspGeminids\u0026nbsphave an hourly rate of 120, the highest listed on the American Meteor Society’s calendar for meteor showers.This means more than 100 shooting stars should appear – though\u0026nbspNASA\u0026nbspcalls the figure a “theoretical maximum” and warns that it represents the experience of a “perfect observer” gifted with “perfect skies”.People residing in suburbs can still expect to see about 30 or 40 meteors per hour, and those living in darker areas on the countryside will be able to spot a bit more than one shooting star per minute.Bad news for people in large cities such as New York or San Francisco: they will see “practically nothing” due to light pollution, the agency warned.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Mike Ashley’s discount retailer increased revenue by 4.5 per cent, to £1.79bn from £1.72bn, in the first half of the financial year, while underlying profits fell by 27 per cent. The company said its earnings before income, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) rose 15.5 per cent to £180.3m excluding the effects of the House of Fraser purchase.

Mr Ashley has previously said he hopes to save the majority of House of Fraser stores, and has blamed ‘greedy landlords’\u0026nbspfor blocking his attempts to negotiate lower rents in order to keep branches open. Sports Direct cutting off nose to spite face with retail invesmentsMike Ashley tells MPs: ‘The internet is killing the high street’House of Fraser customers’ anger as gift cards no longer validHouse of Fraser flagship store on Oxford Street saved from closureOn Thursday, he said: “I have made my views clear that I believe the previous House of Fraser senior management team traded the business whilst it was insolvent for a long time.\u0026nbspThis means we have significant challenges ahead in turning House of Fraser around. “However, I genuinely believe we have acquired a fantastic opportunity and with the efforts of Sports Direct and House of Fraser teams, and the support of the brands, local councils and landlords, we can turn House of Fraser into the Harrods of the High Street.”Mr Ashley recently told MPs on the Housing, Communities and Local Government committee that most UK high streets are beyond help, and called for a tax on online retailers. When the committee asked him whether he could keep all of the House of Fraser branches open, Mr Ashley replied: “What person could keep 59 stores open – beside God? It’s impossible, it can’t be done.”Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at Fidelity International, said: “Replica football strips and cut-price trainers have helped Sport Direct buck the downward trend on the high street, with sales up 4 per cent over the period. However, its quest to turn the House of Fraser stores it’s acquired into the “Harrods of the high street” comes at a cost.“As a result, full-year earnings growth is expected to come in lower than last year. Whether investors will be able to look past the headline figures and see Sports Direct as a true diamond in the rough remains to be seen.”Sports Direct shares dipped by 1 per cent in early trading.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film.

But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience.

Sitting in a hotel room dressed in a baggy black hoodie, walking boots and jogging bottoms, the lean 33-year-old is itching to head out into the chilly London rain and walk to a nearby climbing gym.\u0026nbspFirst, though, we have to talk about Free Solo, which despite sounding like another entry in the interminable Star Wars franchise is in fact an intimate, occasionally hair-raising documentary, showing why Honnold is a man in a class of his own when it comes to climbing rock faces without equipment.Free solo climbing, or soloing, eschews ropes and all the other paraphernalia one normally associates with safety, and leaves just the climber alone on a wall, with nothing but a pair of rubber-soled rock shoes, and chalk for his or her fingertips. As such, it is climbing in its purest and most dangerous form, where one small slip or moment of distraction can be lethal. It’s like an Olympic sport where if you don’t get gold you die, offers expert climber Tommy Caldwell in the film.\u0026nbsp“I think that’s a little hyperbolic,” muses Honnold. But aren’t the stakes so high, you have to be perfect, I ask? “Not perfect, but you have to perform well. It really draws the best out of you. To me, free soloing has definitely always felt like a skills test where you’re like, ‘OK, have I progressed enough as a climber to feel comfortable doing this thing that otherwise could seem impossible?’”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialWe thought it was impossible to free climb the Dawn Wall of El CapitanLast year that seemingly impossible\u0026nbspthing was becoming the first person to free solo Yosemite’s daunting\u0026nbspEl Capitan (or El Cap, as its known among climbers). Towering around 914 metres, the imposing granite monolith was first climbed in 1958 by a three-man team using ropes they took 47 days to reach the summit. Fifty-nine years later, Honnold, tracked by the Free Solo film crew’s cameras, scaled the edifice in three\u0026nbsphours and 56 minutes. The feat stunned the climbing world and had people reaching for superlatives.\u0026nbspI want to think about other people’s accidents and to remember what happened to some of my friends, because that’s how you learn\u0026nbspHe appears comfortable at the cutting edge, but suggests that the only reason many of his solos have been breakthroughs is because he’s in a one-horse race where such big projects are concerned. “There’s nobody else doing it. So it’s easy to be first if you’re the only person playing the game.”In Free Solo, his girlfriend, Sanni McCandless, finds his desire to go further hard to understand. In one particularly difficult scene, she begs him to understand why she wants him to stay alive. He tells her he does, but he doesn’t feel obligated to stop. And anyway, he is already doing everything he can to mitigate the risks, he insists. Even so, this feels like cold comfort given the number of free soloers who have ended up dead – a point Caldwell gently but bluntly tries to drive home to his friend.\u0026nbsp“I knew a lot of those people and I know the whole stories, the context,” says Honnold. “I’ve known that stuff for many years. So it’s not as if that’s fresh knowledge that suddenly hits me like, ‘Oh that’s hard to deal with!’“In some ways it’s important to think about those things. I want to think about other people’s accidents and to remember what happened to some of my friends, because that’s how you learn. That’s how you make sure that doesn’t happen to you or you try your best to make sure that doesn’t happen to you.”\u0026nbspHonnold estimates he has free-solo climbed more than 35 routes\u0026nbsp(National GeographicJimmy Chin)Honnold started climbing regularly in local gyms around the age of 10, but has enjoyed climbing, and looking at the world as a kind of adventure playground, for almost as long as he can remember. He tells me that as a young boy he’d go to services at a Catholic church, near his home in Sacramento, with his mother – until he rebelled and declared himself an atheist – and stare up at the vaulted ceiling and its big exposed beams. He wasn’t contemplating God or Heaven, but “imagining different ways to swing around between the beams and how you could run on that and jump to that. Obviously I never did it, though I did\u0026nbspclimb the outside as a teenager.”\u0026nbspHe also climbed on the roof of his school, and got a kick out of balancing on guard rails.“I love play structures. Like swinging around on monkey bars. But then I’m often the person running around on top of the monkey bar, jumping from one to the other, just seeing what your body can do and enjoying the feeling of the movement.”Ultimately, “climbing feels like play”, he says. “I think that is at the heart of my desire to be a climber.”\u0026nbspOK, I say, but there is feeling like you are playing, and then there is risking your life climbing walls thousands of feet high, without safety gear. How does the one lead to the other? Honnold smiles.\u0026nbsp“I mean, that’s where you take this love of doing a thing, and you combine it with this sort of innate desire to want to improve all the time. To push yourself. When you let that run away from itself for 20 years, you wind up taking on some really, really big challenges.”My father died in the summer, which took some of the pressure off of going to school. Not that he was overtly forcing me, but it was certainly part of itBy the time he went to Berkeley to study civil engineering, at age 19, Honnold was climbing in the gym five days a week, for two to three hours a day. It was a “pretty enthusiastic hobby”, but still not something he thought he could turn into a profession. In the meantime, he drifted on the current of his academic parents’ expectations and disinterestedly continued his education.\u0026nbsp“The expectation was to finish university and get a job and just follow the conventional path. But I had never really chosen that particular path. It’s not like I cared about my studies that much.”His parents had filed for orce after he graduated from high school (“They weren’t in an overtly bad relationship, but I just don’t think they were that into each other, really”), which became final in May of his freshman year. Two months later, his father, who had taken him to the gym and supported his climbing, suffered a fatal heart attack while running through Phoenix airport. Soon after, Honnold dropped out of Berkeley.\u0026nbsp“My father died in the summer, which, to be honest, took some of the pressure off of going to school,” he admits. “Not that he was overtly forcing me to go to university, but it was certainly part of it, which is the expectation that I would.”Instead of going back to class, he hit the road in the family minivan (his mother had recently inherited a car from her father, who died around the same time as her former spouse), and adopted the frugal lifestyle of a “dirtbag climber” around California. When the minivan broke down irreparably, after\u0026nbspa year and a half of touring, he got a bicycle and tent, until he could afford a replacement.\u0026nbspToday, he has sponsors, but at first he was just living from “month to month, seeking out the next adventure or challenge”. The concept of climbing for a living didn’t really exist at the time, so Honnold thought he would eventually “wind up in some peripheral industry, like guiding”.Honnold climbs through the enduro corner on El Capitan’s Freerider (National GeographicJimmy Chin)However, when he became the first to free solo the Regular Northwest Face route of another awe-inspiring peak in Yosemite, the 610-metre\u0026nbspHalf Dome, in 2008, the climb caught the attention of documentary makers who asked him to re-enact sections of the ascent, as well as parts of his solo of the 370m Moonlight Buttress in Utah’s Zion national park, five months earlier, for a short film. This would be the first time that anyone had seen or got a feel for what Honnold went through doing the climbs, because neither had been witnessed by anyone. \u0026nbsp“One of the things I really love about climbing is that people will take you at your word for the most outlandish climb,”\u0026nbsphe says. “You know, ‘Oh, I free-soloed Half Dome today.’ There is basically no evidence of me free-soloing Half Dome. Nobody saw it. I think I told a friend, ‘OK, I’m going back up tomorrow.’ And then I texted him when I was done or whatever.” This level of trust among climbers demands “scrupulous honesty”, so when I jokingly ask why he didn’t cheat and use some nearby equipment to get himself out of a potentially life-threatening situation during the Half Dome solo, because nobody would have known, he is suddenly, and understandably, lost for words.\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspresult of the film shoot, Alone on the Wall, according to his 2015 memoir of the same name, did more than anything else (including a feature in Outside magazine and a breathtaking National Geographic cover photograph) to spread Honnold’s achievements to an audience beyond the “insular world of hardcore climbing”.After Half Dome, El Cap was “the next obvious step. But it was just such a big step, it took many, many more years until it seemed even remotely possible.”I’d learned that I wanted to have a positive experience up there. I didn’t want to feel like I was about to dieOne of Honnold’s strengths is his ability to seemingly override his fear. In Free Solo, an MRI scan of his brain reveals that his amygdala, which initiates the automatic part of the fight or flight response, requires more stimulus than most people’s. This isn’t to say he doesn’t get scared though. When he was on Half Dome, in the previously mentioned hairy predicament he describes as “outrageous”, he certainly felt fear.\u0026nbspBy the time the climber had El Cap in his sights, he says: “I’d learned that I wanted to have a positive experience up there. I didn’t want to feel like I was about to die the whole time.“I mean, it’s not fun if you’re scared. And I climb for myself. I climb for fun. So if it’s really scary, there’s no real point in being up there.”To get himself where he wanted to be, Honnold reckons he did around a dozen other big free solos in Yosemite. None were\u0026nbspas prestigious as Half Dome, but they were “steps in the right direction. They were so challenging in different ways, and bigger, harder, in some way or another.” Finally, in 2015, he was doing a roped climb on El Cap, and for “whatever reason”, he suddenly thought, “This could maybe be possible.”Honnold peers over the edge of Glacier Point in Yosemite national park\u0026nbsp(National GeographicJimmy Chin)He chose a route and started to break it down into sections, or pitches, logging the features of each in a journal. In his mind, he distinguishes between risk and consequence. The latter is a constant (if he falls, he dies) that he has no control over. The former, however, is a variable that he attempts to minimise through research, rehearsal (on ropes), intense focus, and visualisation. Thus, he noted and memorised every foothold and handhold of the most difficult sections, meticulously choreographing the movements, which he still remembers, he would use to get through them. For example, to essay a pitch known as the “boulder problem”, he elected to use a karate kick-like move, rather than try to leap and catch hold of a piece of wall.\u0026nbspHe was particularly concerned about a section of granite which while not very long, and easily overcome using a four-move sequence on a rope, was “super slippery”, and therefore highly dangerous in the context of what Honnold was trying to do.\u0026nbsp“You basically had to put your foot on this, like, ball of glass, and just hope that it stuck, because if it slipped, you’d die,” he says.\u0026nbsp“There just wasn’t really an adequate way to free solo it. So I pioneered this whole variation that went around that move in a 10-metre circle.”Having a film team shooting the climb added another element of potential danger. I bring up the story of Henry Barber, who almost died when he was distracted by a cameraman while being filmed free soloing on cliffs in Britain, and Honnold tells me about Peter Croft almost getting knocked off a wall by a cameraman – “which would be a kind of\u0026nbsphorrendous way to fall to your death”, he laughs.“The thing about it is the cameramen are hanging off\u0026nbspropes, so if they swing off at the side to get a good angle, it means that they’re loaded on this rope like a pendulum and if they come unclipped from whatever they’re in, they’re going to come swinging across the wall and potentially floss you off with the rope.“So those were exactly the kinds of things that the whole crew was super-mindful of on the Free Solo filming, because they didn’t want to cause an accident.”Honnold cleaning his van in Yosemite national park\u0026nbsp(National GeographicJimmy Chin)While training, Honnold slipped and severely sprained an ankle. It still wasn’t completely back to full strength when he tried to free solo El Cap for the first time in 2016, and he aborted the attempt mid-climb. He knew the game was up when he reached a point where “you have to trust your life to this one right foothold, and you’re just palming the wall. I can still visualise it,” he says, miming the movements.“My foot was swollen and it was dark, it was cold, I couldn’t feel my toes. I couldn’t really tell if my toes were exactly on the foothold. You know, I was going to trust my life to this little edge that I couldn’t feel, so I just immediately started cheating.”\u0026nbspFailing was “pretty disheartening and pretty depressing”, but soon he came to see the fact he had been able to “walk up the base of El Cap and start climbing” as a “big victory”. As he’d written in his book, just getting off the ground was going to be a challenge for anyone who attempted to solo the wall.\u0026nbsp“So even that felt like this huge milestone in some ways.”\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe was left feeling “quite a bit hungrier”, and went to Las Vegas to live, train and recover. He returned to Yosemite in the spring of last year, and on Saturday\u0026nbsp3 June, almost two years after he’d begun his preparations, achieved what he’d set out to do\u0026nbsp– the highlights of which are captured in beautiful, breathtaking, vertigo-inducing detail in Free Solo.‘Great Escape’ pilot’s rare Spitfire discovered on Norwegian mountainThe audacious Wordsworth who put mountaineering on the mapMan survives a week lost on mountain by eating beesAfter dreaming about soloing the wall for so long, I wonder if actually doing it had left a big El Cap-sized hole in Honnold’s life. “So far not so much,” he says. “Partly because there’s so many other climbing challenges I’m working on.”\u0026nbspThe week after his El Cap solo, he went to Alaska to prepare for an expedition to Antarctica. Now, while he is doing press for the film, he is back in the climbing gym, and “getting back to my roots, a little bit”.\u0026nbspHe has to be careful where he goes, though. In LA, recently, he was mobbed at a gym by fans, who turned what was meant to be a relaxing workout in between getting off a flight and giving a presentation in the evening, into a full-on, meet-and-greet-type experience. “I was like, to myself: ‘This is definitely not a relaxing, fun way to stretch after my flight. This is crazy! There’s way too many people!’ It is stressing me out just thinking about it,” he says, and I can hear his voice quavering.Still, he can handle it a lot better than the “shy, dorky loner” he was as a kid. Then, it would have been “like my worst nightmare”, he confesses. “Can you imagine? You’re too shy to talk to anybody and then you have to basically do public speaking every single night, and interviews and things.”Free Solo is going to bring Honnold to an even wider audience, and could even take him and the film’s team, headed by co-directors Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, to the Oscars. The film is an incredible record of an amazing feat, and will forever be a testament to the climber’s dedication and death-defying athleticism. \u0026nbsp“I can’t wait to show my kids and grandchildren\u0026nbspsome day,” enthuses Honnold, who says he’d like to have a family. “I mean, imagine me as an 85-year-old showing my grandchild: ‘Look what he used to be able to do! That’s cool!’”National Geographic Documentary Film\u0027s Free Solo is released in cinemas on 14\u0026nbspDecemberShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

According to the letter, obtained by the , Mr Ashley offered Debenhams a £40m interest-free loan, which was rejected. In his message, the Sports Direct owner said: “November was the worst November for retailers in living memory.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialCan Mike Ashley turn around the high street when no one else is tryingMike Ashley tells MPs: ‘The internet is killing the high street’Sports Direct set for stormy AGM but Mike Ashley will win in the end“Additionally it is speculated that the company currently has a zero chance of survival.”Earlier this year, Debenhams announced plans to close up to 50 shops, putting 4,000 jobs at risk. The cuts are being made in an attempt to slash costs, after the company reported its biggest ever loss of £492m in the year to 1 September. Sports Direct currently holds 29.7 per cent of Debenhams, just shy of the 30 per cent threshold at which an offer for the remainder of the company must be made, according to the UK takeover code. Mr Ashley said in his letter that he was concerned that the Debenhams board “doesn’t really seem to appreciate” the position that the company is in “and their responsibility to shareholders”. He added: “Sports Direct is Debenhams’ largest shareholder. What we are offering is a very public statement of support at a critical time for the Debenhams business.”The letter concluded with a request that Mr Bucher reconsider the offer of a loan, and respond by “lunch time Friday”. A spokesperson for Debenhams said: “We welcome Sports Direct’s proposal as a clear demonstration of their willingness to support the company. “However, as the offer came with conditions that could affect the interests of other stakeholders, while the board does not think it could accept the proposal, as presented, it has invited Sports Direct to engage as part of our broader refinancing process.”Shares in Debenhams were down 4.89 per cent to 5.45 at close of trading on Thursday, while Sports Direct’s stock tumbled by 14.8 per cent to 235.40. Earlier in the day, Sports Direct issued a trading update for the first half and revealed that House of Fraser had lost £31.5m in the first 11 weeks after the discount retailer bought it out of administration.Sports Direct also recently purchased Evans Cycles from its administrators.

This might seem like a pretty plain piece of ground if it weren\u0027t on Mars, but we\u0027re glad to see that.The spacecraft appears to be sitting in some sort of hollow, a dip made in the Elysium region where it landed when a meteor landed there. That should make it easier for the probe to dig down into the surface.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The underlying motivation behind such harassment appears to be frustration with Waymo’s parent company Alphabet, combined with fears the technology poses a threat to both jobs and road safety.“Everybody hates Waymo drivers,” one resident told\u0026nbspThe Arizona Republic. “They are dangerous.”Earlier this year, an autonomous vehicle being tested by Uber hit and killed a woman on a darkened street\u0026nbspin Tempe, which borders Chandler.Such frustrations led one man to block the path of a Waymo vehicle by standing in front of\u0026nbspit.\u0026nbspThe police report for the incident stated the man was “sick and tired of the Waymo vehicles driving in his neighbourhood, and apparently thought the best idea to resolve this was to stand in front of one of these vehicles.”The company recently launched the first ever commercial self-driving taxi service in nearby Phoenix, with the hope of a much broader roll out in the coming years.A Waymo\u0026nbspspokesperson said drivers of its self-driving vehicles are trained to deal with threats from the public.“Safety is at the core of everything we do, which means that keeping our drivers, our riders and the public safe is our top priority,” the spokesperson said.“Over the past two years, we’ve found Arizonans to be welcoming and excited by the potential of this technology to make our roads safer. We believe a key element of local engagement has been ongoing work with the communities in which we drive, including Arizona law enforcement and first responders.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

People were against no deal by 44 per cent to 37 per cent, for a new referendum by 46 per cent to 30 per cent and for Norway by 41 per cent to 39 per cent.A sign of just how difficult it will be to secure any deal that enjoys broad support came from another question, which asked respondents to say what it is that is most important for a Brexit deal to secure.The equal top answers were “controlling immigration” and “maintaining smooth trading links with the EU” – two things which, to an extent, are mutually exclusive because of the red lines set out by the EU and UK in negotiations.Ensuring that there is no border erected between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – the matter at the heart of opposition to Ms May’s plan – was rated as the key issue by just six per cent of people.EU ‘will renegotiate with Theresa May’ Brexit deal is voted down’Ms May is likely to play for time if the vote does go against her next week, and travel to Brussels for a summit of the European Council where she may ask for further concessions to try and make her deal more palatable to MPs.Despite a string of European figures saying there could be no further talks, ex-commission president Mr Prodi appeared to throw Ms May a lifeline on Saturday. Asked how he expected the commission to respond after the vote, he said: “Negotiate. We must keep free trade between us because it is in the British interests and European interest.”On Saturday, Ms Rudd hit out at Brexiteers who she said “flounce out quite a lot” instead of trying to get things done, an attack coming after Boris Johnson\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspDavid Davis\u0026nbspquit the cabinet over Ms May’s deal.\u0026nbspAll have leadership ambitions and have been jockeying for position ahead of a potential future contest in the coming weeks.In an interview, Ms Rudd also took the unusual step of revealing details of a private conversation with the prime minister, even critiquing her leadership style by saying “she is not always forthcoming” about what she wants.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspMs Rudd is seen as a leading candidate from the moderate wing of the party and even said in her interview that she hoped it chooses a “centrist” figure for its next leader, though she said a contest at this point would be “too indulgent”.Source Note: BMG Research interviewed a representative sample of 1,508 GB adults online between 4 and 7\u0026nbspDecember.

We know the answer as to whether there are going to be any changes – and it is no.”The Democratic Unionist Party has told Theresa May not to “roll over” to the EU, heaping further pressure on the prime minister after her Brussels failure, writes Independent\u0026nbspdeputy political editor Rob Merrick.Arlene Foster – the leader of the party propping up the Tories in power – blamed Ms May personally for the setback, saying: “This is a difficulty of the prime minister’s own making.”More here:The Brexit referendum cost the taxpayer £129.1m to deliver, the Electoral Commission has announced for the first time.In a new report, the commission said the total figure\u0026nbspincludes:The cost of administering the poll – including the running of over 40,000 polling stations, issuing and opening postal votes, and the counting of votes – totalling £94.5m.Statutory grants to the two designated lead campaigners totalling £1.2m.The delivery costs for the two designated lead campaigners to send a mailing to each elector or household in each referendum area across the UK, as provided for in law. This totalled almost £25.4m.The cost of a UK-wide public awareness campaign undertaken by the Electoral Commission to raise awareness of the poll and provide information on how to take part, totalling £6m.Speaking ahead of the meeting, Leo Varadkar, the Irish PM, says: As Europe we reaffirmed our commitment for the need for a backstop. An open border between Northern Ireland and Ireland can\u0027t be a backdoor to the single market, he said.That\u0027s why European countries also very strongly support backstop. It is not just an Irish issue, it is very much a European issue as well.It is very much a case of in the European Union being one-for-all and all-for-one.Theresa May is now in the room with the leaders of the other 27 EU member states in Brussels. But before things kick off, the PM seems to have had a terse conversation with the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Junker.\u0026nbspLuxembourg prime minister Xavier Bettel said the EU leaders had had an honest exchange with the PM and said it was now up to MPs at Westminster to be responsible and vote for the deal.I think that for internal political reasons in the UK, some people try to gamble relations between the EU and the United Kingdom for the future, he said.Theresa May did the best possible job. She did the best possible deal and now the MPs in London should be responsible and know if they want to have the best possible deal or to go in the direction where they don\u0027t know what will come out.They should not forget they are elected to represent their citizens and not to just have their personal, political future thinking about that.Theresa May has arrived at the second day of the EU summit in Brussels - and is expected to answer questions from the awaiting press pack at midday. The prime minister doesn\u0027t look like she is holding out much hope for concessions today from her European counterparts.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspvideoId5979493571001 sandboxallow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-top-navigation height500 layoutfixed-height i-amphtml-layout-fixed-height i-amphtml-layout-size-defined styleheight:500px i-amphtml-layoutfixed-heightArriving at the summit, Romanian president Klaus Iohannis said he does not now expect a special Brexit summit in January to agree a way forward, urging the Commons to back the agreed UK-EU deal.We need a positive vote from the British Parliament, not a summit, he said. We want a vote. We need a vote from the British Parliament to continue. We very much hope this will be a positive vote. We count on that.After the bruising summit in Brussels, cabinet office minister David Lidington,\u0026nbspdefended Mrs May\u0027s handling of the talks with Brussels after criticism from Michel Barnier.He told Today: Anybody who has heard Theresa May in debate, anybody who has heard her around the cabinet table, knows there is a very clear plan.He described the talks as a welcome first step that was the removal of uncertainty over the EU\u0027s intentions, because it had shown it wanted a speedy UK trade deal that would remove the need for the backstop in the first place.Asked if the government could support indicative votes on options if the PM\u0027s Brexit deal is voted down in Parliament, he added: Certainly I will be supporting the Prime Minister in campaigning vigorously for Parliament to approve the deal that has been negotiated.Were that not to happen then obviously the prime minister, the cabinet, would need to take stock and come to Parliament accordingly.Please allow a moment for the liveblog to loadThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The limited assurances provided in the statement are extremely unlikely to placate Ms May’s\u0026nbspMPs, who have said they want major changes to the agreement.Accounts of the meeting suggest the prime minister’s speech, in which she called for help to get the agreement “over the line”, was repeatedly interrupted by Angela Merkel asking her what she actually wanted from them.Theresa May dashes hopes of ‘breakthrough’ to solve Brexit crisisSenior UK government officials admitted that the prime minister did not bring any documented proposals with her to the meeting.\u0026nbspThe approach puzzled EU diplomats, who for days before the conference had said they needed to see what proposals Ms May had come up with before they could respond to her request for aid.Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, said at a midnight press conference after the discussion: “I do find it uncomfortable that there’s an impression perhaps in the UK that it is for the EU to propose solutions.\u0026nbsp“It is for the UK leaving the EU and I would have thought that it was rather more for the British government.”In the margins of the summit the meeting is already being called “Salzburg 2.0” – a reference to a previous summit in September where the prime minister’s dinner speech also ended up accidentally hardening the EU position.\u0026nbspCrunch vote on May’s deal Brexit definitely not before ChristmasBrexit drags UK property market to weakest level in six yearsJeremy Corbyn accuses May of presiding over ‘government in chaos’What is the Brexit deal? Theresa May’s agreement with the EU explainedThe statement issued by leaders warns that the withdrawal agreement “is not open for renegotiation”, but clarifying that the controversial backstop will “apply temporarily, unless and until it is superseded by a subsequent agreement” and that the EU will “use its best endeavours” to get it replaced quickly “so that the backstop would only be in place for as long as strictly necessary”.They assured the UK it was EU’s “firm determination to work speedily” to replace it with a trade agreement.The statement will be of little help to the prime minister, who is struggling to get her deal through parliament after a bruising confidence vote on Wednesday where over 100 of her own MPs said she should quit.The prime minister had told EU leaders: “There is a majority in my parliament who want to leave with a deal, so with the right assurances this deal can be passed.“Indeed it is the only deal capable of getting through my parliament.”She called on them to give her something that would “change the dynamic” in Westminster, adding: “We have to change the perception that the backstop could be a trap from which the UK could not escape. Until we do, the deal – our deal – is at risk.”Juncker and European Council president Donald Tusk at a midnight press conference following the meeting (AP)Ms May is said to have asked for a legally binding 2021 deadline to end the backstop, but it was pointed out by leaders that this would contradict the fundamental principles of the agreement. When asked if the UK could propose a way around this, the prime minister was said to have no answer.Arriving at the meeting the prime minister had downplayed hopes of an “immediate breakthrough”. But the performance on Thursday evening appears to have derailed the possibility of any further help down the road in the new year, which the EU seemed receptive to before the session got underway. Such plans could have taken the form of protocols or side-declarations to the treaty.Earlier in the day German chancellor Angela Merkel had said: “I do not see that this withdrawal agreement can be changed.“We can discuss whether there should be additional assurances, but here the 27 member states will act very much in common and make their interests very clear.”Created with Sketch.Brexit betrayal march in London Show all 41Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester carrying a noose at the Brexit betrayal march.

It’s not about pushing through maximum positions but to find a provision that is the best possible for both sides.”Juha Sipila, the Finnish prime minister, told reporters that it would be “a little bit difficult” to give the PM legally binding assurances but that leaders wanted to try and help anyway.In one positive for the prime minister Mr Juncker, the commission president, said he wanted talks on the future relationship to begin as soon as the House of Commons had approved the agreement – as a sign that the EU was serious about replacing the backstop.

Parliament has taken it. We know the options for Brexit. Parliament will have to decide on one of them. If parliament can’t then it should decide to go back to the people.“Now should be the time of preparation – parliament to make sure it can canvas the options in sensible manner, one by one, to reach agreement on an option or a referendum Europe to ensure that if Britain is ready to think again, Europe is ready also to think again.“All that is necessary is for leadership: in parliament if not in government, and in Europe where despite all the myriad of challenges European leaders have, they should understand that changing Brexit would be the greatest boost to Europe’s economy and politics and that therefore, they need to focus on the part they can play and play it.”His intervention comes during the second day of talks in Brussels, where Ms May\u0026nbspheading straight into meetings with French president Emmanuel Macron ahead of a press conference on Friday.Her de-facto deputy David Lidington defended her handling of the talks, saying:\u0026nbspAnybody who has heard Theresa May in debate, anybody who has heard her around the cabinet table, knows there is a very clear plan.”Mr Lidington\u0026nbspdescribed the talks as “a welcome first step that was the removal of uncertainty” over the EU’s intentions, because it had shown it wanted a “speedy UK trade deal” that would remove the need for the backstop in the first place.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

More than 600 people have paid or put down deposits to fly aboard Virgin\u0027s suborbital missions, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio and pop star Justin Bieber. A 90-minute flight costs $250,000.Short sightseeing trips to space aboard Blue Origin\u0027s New Shepard rocket are likely to cost around $200,000 to $300,000, at least to start, Reuters reported in July. Tickets will be offered ahead of the first commercial launch, and test flights with Blue Origin employees are expected to begin in 2019.Other firms planning a variety of passenger spacecraft include Boeing Co, Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX and late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen\u0027s Stratolaunch.In September, SpaceX said Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, founder and chief executive of online fashion retailer Zozo, would be the company\u0027s first passenger on a voyage around the moon on its forthcoming Big Falcon Rocket spaceship, tentatively scheduled for 2023.Musk, the billionaire CEO of electric carmaker Tesla , said the Big Falcon Rocket could conduct its first orbital flights in two to three years as part of his grand plan to shuttle passengers to the moon and eventually fly humans and cargo to Mars.According to Virgin, SpaceShipTwo is hauled to an altitude of about 45,000 feet (13.7 kms) by the WhiteKnightTwo carrier airplane and released. The spaceship then fires its rocket motor to catapult it to at least 50 miles (80.47 km) above Earth, high enough for passengers to experience weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet.Bezos\u0027 New Shepard has already flown to that altitude - an internationally recognized boundary between Earth\u0027s atmosphere and outer space known as the Karman line - though the Blue Origin trip did not carry humans.Virgin\u0027s Thursday launch likely will not go as high as the Karman line. Virgin\u0027s pilots are aiming to soar 50 miles into the sky - the U.S. military and NASA\u0027s definition of the edge of space and high enough to earn commercial astronaut wings by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.Thursday\u0027s test flight carried two pilots, four NASA research payloads, and a mannequin named Annie as a stand-in passenger.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Here are some of the key figures.Jo Johnson resigned as rail minister and demanded a second referendum.Boris Johnsons brother said the deal was substantially worse than staying in the EU, and it was imperative we go back to the people and check they still want to leave.Jo Johnsons resignation in November  came just months after his own brother Boris quit as Foreign Secretary - saying he couldnt back Mrs Mays plans any longer.Justine Greening said she believes there are other Conservative MPs who also support the idea of a second referendum - after she became the most high-profile Tory to endorse it.The former education and transport secretary said Theresa May’s Chequers plan “in practice suits no one”.She said that a new referendum would provide “a route forwards”.She added:“only solution is to take the final Brexit decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians.“I think what I’m saying is what everyone is seeing in parliament.She told : “The promise was that we would have a deal about our future trading relationship with the European Union. Everything would be settled. But we’re not going to get a deal.We’re going to get a withdrawal agreement and our future trading relationship will not be determined until after we’ve left the European Union.That is not what the British people were promised that is not what they voted for. It is the most terrible betrayal.When the history books are written on this period, it will reflect exceedingly badly on an awful lot of people, who have put their heads in the sand and allowed this terrible mistake to take place.”Alex Sobel – LabourAlison McGovern – LabourAlistair Carmichael – Liberal DemocratsAnna McMorrin – LabourAnna Soubry – ConservativeAnna Turley – LabourBen Bradshaw – LabourBridget Phillipson – LabourCaroline Lucas – GreenCatherine McKinnell – LabourChris Bryant – LabourChris Leslie – LabourChristine Jardine – Liberal DemocratsChuka Umunna – LabourDarren Jones – LabourDavid Lammy – LabourDominic Grieve – ConservativePaul Williams – LabourEd Davey – Liberal DemocratsGareth Thomas – LabourGuto Bebb – ConservativeHeidi Allen – ConservativeIan Blackford – SNPIan Murray – LabourJamie Stone – Liberal DemocratsJo Stevens – LabourJo Swinson – Liberal DemocratsJustine Greening – ConservativeLayla Moran – Liberal DemocratsLiz Saville Roberts – Plaid CymruLuciana Berger – LabourMadeleine Moon – LabourMary Creagh – LabourNicola Sturgeon – SNPNorman Lamb – Liberal DemocratsOwen Smith – LabourPaul Farelly – LabourDr Paul Williams – LabourPeter Kyle – LabourPhil Wilson – LabourRosie Duffield – LabourRupa Huq – LabourSarah Wollaston – ConservativeStella Creasy – LabourStephen Doughty – LabourSteve Reed – LabourSusan Elan Jones – LabourTim Farron – Liberal DemocratsTom Brake – Liberal DemocratsTommy Sheppard – SNPVince Cable – Liberal DemocratsWera Hobhouse – Liberal DemocratsWes Streeting – LabourThe Conservative MP said she sees no alternative other than backing a second referendum on leaving the EU.She becomes the latest Tory to support a new vote, saying the right-wing of her party had made Theresa Mays Chequers Brexit plan - dead.She told BBC: They have behaved unacceptably through this and have completely tied her hands.Allen campaigned to Remain in the EU in .She said there was no alternative other than asking – should we come to that, no deal, that looks like thats whats going to happen – then we need to go back to the public to decide what they want us to do next.Wollaston, the Conservative MP for Totnes, said she has signed up to the Peoples Vote campaign for a vote on the final Brexit deal.The -year-old was previously the only Conservative MP to officially support the campaign.When asked why she is in support of the second referendum, Wollaston said: “If in two years’ time there are serious unintended consequences, I don’t want people writing to me asking ‘what did you do ’ I want to be able to point to the things that I did try to do.Not because I want to block Brexit, but because I want to check we’re prepared.

If so, we need to massively ramp up preparation for a clean break.Why wouldn’t the EU come up with a sensible compromise Because this is a club of ideological bullies whose commitment to the project is far more important to them than the interests of their own citizens.They want us to hold a second referendum, so we make the “right” choice.But another ballot would be a disaster for trust in our democracy.The arrogance of those pushing for one here at home knows no bounds.It’s now revealed that Tony Blair, now effectively the Remain architect-in-chief, demanded that the body set up to scrutinise the work of former frontline politicians didn’t publish how he earned his cash after he left office.He doesn’t want us to find out, and he certainly doesn’t want us to have any say in the future of the country.He, and those around him, think they know best.But .million people think dferently — and Theresa May owes them every ounce of her strength.YET more evidence that the NHS is in need of desperate reform.An “over-s” AE wing  Bereaved parents being shafted It’s not money that’s the problem.

We are due to leave the EU on March  next year, deal or no deal — and Parliament cannot agree what to do.Some MPs want the PM to go back to Brussels and negotiate something better. Others want to negotiate a dferent deal altogether. Labour wants an election. Die-hard Remainers want another referendum. Many Leavers just want to get out without a deal.And Mrs May insists her deal is the right one, despite knowing it is so unpopular that she couldn’t put it to a vote in the Commons.Whoever gets their way, it is time to strap on our seatbelts and brace ourselves for an almighty crash. However things end, we are heading for multiple constitutional crises that risk smashing our political system to pieces.Yesterday Mrs May promised more assurances from Brussels about her deal’s so-called “backstop”, in which we will be trapped in a customs union with the EU, and Northern Ireland will be trapped inside the single market.But it is completely implausible that she will be able to negotiate an end to the backstop or the right to simply withdraw from it in future.So convinced was the PM that she could not win this argument with Brussels, she did not propose it during the original talks. The Europeans insist they will not make any legally binding commitments about how the backstop might end.So the only effect of delaying the vote is to take up even more time before March . In other words, the game of chicken between ministers and rebel MPs will get more and more high-risk.The time for MPs to prevent a no-deal Brexit will be cut short, the chances of no deal will increase and ministers — because they want to bully Parliament into accepting their deal — will continue to refuse to prepare properly for no deal.And remember what the PM’s deal involves. For nearly two years — but maybe longer — we will pay into the EU budget, accept free movement and respect all European laws.Then, when there is no agreement on the future relationship, we will find ourselves in the backstop. Northern Ireland will effectively be annexed by Brussels. British goods heading for Ulster will be stopped and checked, European goods will be waved through. The EU will decide how other countries can trade with Britain, without our say and regardless of the effects on British jobs. And we will be forced to follow the rulings of the European Court of Justice.Our constitution says Parliament is sovereign: Nothing is more powerful than an Act of Parliament, debated and approved by elected representatives.What’s more, no Parliament can “bind its successors”: One generation of MPs cannot dictate what future generations can and cannot decide.Yet the PM’s deal subordinates Parliament to the EU, and does so permanently, with no legal right for Britain to escape its punishing terms. It would leave us as a colony: A country dismembered and incapable of democratic self-government.The remaining options are just as dangerous. Many pro- Europeans want Britain to join the European Economic Area and form a customs union with the EU.Norway Plus, as their plan is now known, would mean Britain accepting even more European laws than the PM proposes, without any say over what they are. For that reason, coupled with the knowledge that it does not avoid the backstop, Norway Plus is even worse than Theresa May’s deal.Yet the “Norwegians” inside the Conservative Party persist. They know there is no majority among Tory MPs for their model but they have a plan.If Mrs May’s deal is rejected and they win a majority for Norway Plus with support from Labour MPs, they can install a caretaker prime minister to deliver it.With a Commons majority for Norway Plus, they believe the Queen would be obliged to appoint their man — David Lidington, perhaps — as PM.The risk to the monarchy of embroiling the Queen in a political controversy of such magnitude seems not to matter to them. One other option, pushed by a handful of Conservatives and many Labour MPs, is to re-run the referendum. Their goal is to remain in the EU after all.The possibility they might lose, the effects on public confidence in our democracy and the instability caused by a narrow remain victory do not matter.For these Europhiles, staying in the EU is more important than the damage they might do to Parliament and to the party system our democracy relies upon.The default option, however,Parliament rejects the PM’s deal, is a no-deal Brexit. That was decided when Parliament passed the Withdrawal Act earlier this year. To override that Act, Parliament must do more than hold a single vote, and the Government must do more than negotiate something .Parliament must amend the Withdrawal Act or pass another Act to set us on a dferent path. If there is any ambiguity, the Supreme Court — whose president, Baroness Hale, has challenged the sovereignty of Parliament in the past — might again play a controversial role.While the Commons is ided, we know a majority of MPs are determined to stop a no-deal Brexit at almost any cost. Some senior Tories say they will vote against the Government in a confidence motion — risking the election of Jeremy Corbyn —it means they can stop leaving without a deal.It is probable we are heading for Norway Plus or another referendum. Whatever happens, the constitutional consequences are likely to be profound.The power of the courts, the party system, Parliamentary sovereignty, the future of the Union, even the monarchy, might come under scrutiny. Whatever happens will be controversial and further ide the country. But something has to give.So buckle your seatbelts and adopt the brace position.

This, alas, is the position the Government and the Prime Minister have now reached.For many people their virtues and vices are cut from the same cloth. Indeed, one may simply be an extension of another. This is what we have seen with Mrs May.Her very steadiness, dutulness and determination have led her to be unable to see that her policy has failed. In her latest House of Commons statement it was once again the mantra that “nothing has changed” — these three small dangerous words that did so much damage to her election campaign were wheeled out again but convinced nobody.After Ministers had taken to the media to insist that the vote on her deal would go ahead there was not one word of apology to them or hint of embarrassment that policy had turned on a sixpence. Continuity, instead, was claimed.At the heart of this humiliation was a dreadful deal that does not represent Brexit. As a London cab driver told me yesterday, he did not vote for a deal. He voted to leave.That widespread sentiment is not honoured in the Withdrawal Agreement, which subjects the United Kingdom to the European Union as a vassal state or colony.Yet the humiliation is even greater for having failed even to allow her deal to be voted on in Parliament. Fearing a huge defeat the Prime Minister is now scurrying around the Continent asking for something she said was impossible a few days ago.Last week this deal was the only one available and the British people were told to like it or lump it.Today, apparently new assurances can be given which will allay our fears. Both positions cannot be true and as EU officials have been arrogantly dismissive of Mrs May’s request it seems that only the airline profit margins will benefit from these trips.However, it could have been so dferent. Had the Prime Minister held the vote and lost by over  votes then she would have had proof to show the European Union that the deal could not pass through Parliament.It would have made it abundantly clear that the Withdrawal Agreement had failed and would have encouraged the EU to take her request for change seriously. Instead the President of the Commission and of the Council have mocked her and almost thrown back in her face the line that “nothing has changed”.Fortunately the UK has a trump card, which is to leave without a deal. In these circumstances we would save £billion of taxpayer’s money and be able to remove all tarfs on goods we do not produce,  helping the least well off.We can immediately cut VAT on domestic fuel, helping the elderly in the winter and remove it from women’s sanitary products where the imposition of tax is an injustice.The Prime Minister has challenged those who want to deliver on the Referendum result to be “honest” about the risks of leaving without a deal, including potential queues at Dover, as there have been in the past when the French go on strike or blockade the roads.There is inevitably a risk that the EU is determined to punish a country that leaves and is willing to break International Treaty obligations.On the other hand there are tangible advantages to be had, too, as Mrs May must herself recognise. Otherwise she ought not to have said “no deal is better than a bad deal”. If she never believed this to be the case then it explains why her negotiating position has been so weak and submissive to the EU. It is the root cause of her failure.This must now be recognised. The Government’s Policy, personally linked to the Prime Minister and the operation at Downing Street, has produced an agreement that fails to deliver Brexit and breaks Theresa May’s own promises.This has lost her the confidence of the House of Commons, for she can no longer push her most important business through, and by all constitutional precedence she ought to resign.Mrs May is a decent person with many honourable characteristics but her handling of Brexit has been hopeless, and has left the country, the Conservative Party and the Government humiliated.As we look to forge an agreement that could set our relations with our nearest neighbours for generations and define the authority of our own democracy, it is time for someone who backs Brexit to take over.Theresa May has failed because she never really wanted to do it. She is now caught in the web that she herself spun, and it is her duty to go.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I could pay off the mortgage and give some money to my kids’.”But Angela’s dreams were shattered when she excitedly rushed to her local Post Office and was told the win could not be veried.Florist Angela said: “At the Post Office they put in the code over and over again, but it wasn’t working.“Everyone I had showed it to said it was a winner, but I emailed Camelot and five days later they replied and said I hadn’t scratchedoff properly.“If I had scratched off any more the card would have been wrecked.”Camelot told Angela one of her ‘winning’ grid codes was an E - not the F that she had scratched – meaning the three symbols she revealed did not match up.It comes after dad-of-four Eric was also denied a £k payout on his card - after being accused of doctoring the letter F to look like an E.Unemployed Eric, who buys six scratchcards a day, believes there was a misprint on the scratchcard after he matched three symbols.He has now invited cops to his home to have a look at the ticket and says he is the one being cheated.Similarly, Angela believes Camelot is keeping her cash because it wants to avoid a mass pay out in case there is a widespread fault with the cards.The mum-of-two said: “When I spoke to Camelot they said this had never happened before.“I told them ‘you’ve got a faulty batch and you know it and are trying not to pay out’.“It makes me feel angry because they’re denying me a legit pay-out.”The game offers five top prizes of £, by giving sixteen co-ordinates which are used to scratch off squares on a grid in the hope of matching three pharaoh symbols.Camelot insists the winning ticket has not yet been claimed and refuted claims of a faulty batch.A spokesperson said today: We do not believe this to be a faulty batch as Ms Mason claims.We will reconstruct the card in our system, just as we did in Mr Walkers case, to determine whether it is a genuine winning ticket.If we believe that somebody has intentionally attempted to defraud The National Lottery, then, just like any other company, we reserve the right to take whatever action we consider is appropriate – which includes reporting the matter to the police.”Angela has refused to give up on her claim and wants others to be aware of the alleged “faulty cards in case they miss out on their own fortune.She said: At first I took Camelot’s word for it, but now I’ve seen its happened to someone .“I don’t think it’s right. My le could have been completely changed.“I feel like I’ve been cheated.  “When I scratched the card I didn’t think it was real. But you start to believe.“For Camelot to turn around and say no, it feels like they’ve ripped that dream away.“It’s a huge conglomerate against one person. What hope in hell do you have ”Both Angela and Eric now argue they should receive the £k bounty.She said: “It’s funny that now two faulty cards have come to light within a few days of each other.It can’t just be us two. But Lotto is still saying: No, the winning card hasn’t come to light yet.“I know I’ve won.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000456121357.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"teething gels dont work pharmacist advice","story":"Childrens teething products containing the drug lidocaine, including Bonjela and Anbesol, will only be available in pharmacies from  under new guidance from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency .There are very small risks associated with using the products but they should only be used when non-medical options havent provided pain relief, the health body said.A review into the products found there was a lack of evidence theres any benefit to using the gels in place of non-medical options like teething toys.Instead a pharmacist of health care professional should provide guidance before the medicated gels are used.Dr Sarah Branch, deputy director of MHRA’s vigilance and risk management of medicines, said: Our review showed there is a lack of evidence of benefit to using teething gels.To help babies and children with teething, parents and caregivers should try non-medicine options such as rubbing or massaging the gums or a teething ring.We want to make sure you get the right information about teething.If your child continues to have problems with teething, talk to your pharmacist or healthcare professional about the best options.Ash Soni, president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said: It’s natural for parents to be concernedtheir baby is experiencing discomfort with sore gums when teething.Your local pharmacist can provide parents and caregivers of teething babies with expert advice and recommend the best course of treatment.Your pharmacist is always a good first port of call for any common condition your child develops.It’s advised that you give a teething baby something to chew on like a teething ring that’s been in the fridge but,that isn’t enough, then your pharmacist can give you expert advice about using a teething product containing lidocaine and how to use it safely.The products that will no longer be available in the supermarket, only in pharmacies, include:Teething gels for adults are not affected by this change.A spokesman for Bonjela said: Bonjela is aware that the Medicines  Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyhas stated that treatments for teething pain containing lidocaine hydrochlorideshould be available as pharmacy only and in packs of  grams or less.Bonjela Teething Gel, which contain lidocaine, have been widely used by parents to soothe the pain and discomfort their children experience when teething.As of September , Bonjela Teething Gel is no longer available as a result of a business decision to withdraw it.Bonjela Junior Gel continues to be available as a product for children over five months for the relief of pain from common mouth ulcers and denture irritation but will no longer be indicated as a treatment for teething pain in children.In line with the MHRA ruling, the packaging will be updated with the amended indication that the product can be used on children over five months for relief of pain from common mouth ulcers. The packaging of bonjela Junior Gel will have warning that is not suitable for treatment of teething in children.If youre worried your child has suffered any side effects from using a teething gel you should speak to a GP.You can also report any products through the MHRAs yellow card scheme."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000429744850.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle singing talent hamilton","story":"The happy couple were pictured in the Royal Circle at the Victoria Palace Theatre in London, cracking jokes with the shows creator Lin-Manuel Miranda and his we.Now Miranda has revealed more about their August visit to the hip-hop history musical which parodies the British monarchy.He revealed how the Suits actress knew all the words off by heart and spent the evening enjoying a sing-a-long.Speaking to Hello! magazine, he said: “It was pretty wild. It was pretty surreal to see the Duchess knows the lyrics a little better than I do! She was sitting next to me and mouthing along.“I am playing Hamilton again in Puerto Rico in a few weeks and I really was like, oh man I’ve got to brush up on my lyrics.So, it was a joy and they’re wonderful.”Harry was reportedly also on good form, joking about playing his ancestor King George III before bursting into mock song.Meghan has been branded a natural performer in the past, but not always for the best.Former friend Ninaki Priddy shared a video last year of the Duchess dancing wildly and preparing for a music video audition.Priddy said at the time: “I don’t think she ever doubted she was going to be famous. She loved the spotlight.“I smile at the good times. We had some really great memories.“But she has become a dferent person.“She is unrecognisable to me. A manufactured, exaggerated version of herself.”Last week it was revealed a “radio musical comedy” of the Duchess’s le is set to air on Radio  on New Year’s Day.The Sixth In Line to Be King and I is “an inspired celebration of Meghan Markle’s le to date…look[ing] ahead to what promises to be an exciting  for the happy royal couple as they expectUnfortunately the Duchess herself won’t be making an appearance this time, with British comedian Pippa Evans landing the role of Meghan.It comes after the Sun revealed how the Duchess of Cambridge told Meghan not to berate members of her team after she b****cked a member of staff.The row, which has been denied by the Palace, was after Meghan made Kate cry over Princess Charlotte’s bridesmaid’s dress.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have now decided they dont want to live in Kensington next to William and Kate and are instead planning a move to Frogmore Cottage in Windsor.A friend close to the couple has claimed that the decision to move may be

after saying he had scratched three matching symbols on the National Lotterys £-a-time Pharoahs Fortune card.But lotto chiefs Camelot called in fraud cops after claiming the letter F had been doctored to look like an E and said the winning scratchcard hasnt been sold yet.Have YOU had a similar experience with a scratchcard  Email us tips@the-sun or call   In the clip obtained by The Sun Online, Ms Emmadi can be seen on the phone at the shop counter in a white coat as she buys several scratchcards from Premier Store on East Road in Sheffield on November .In a separate sale, Mr Walker can also be seen buying tickets at the same shop on the same day.Wearing a hat and green jumper Mr Walker is seen standing at the counter as he waits for his tickets.Speaking today, Ms Emmadi told The Sun Online: Camelot are a load of b******t, the people in the shop where I bought the ticket from, they have claimed the tickets back, they are not on the shelf any more.If you went in that shop now and looked at their machines they would tell you there are no tickets there.There is all of the other tickets, they have swapped in from the gold tickets to the number sevens, [Camelot] are lying but the shop isnt lying.She added: We are getting slandered. Camelot are scammers, I have no need to lie. It is a misprint. We are getting slated. I just want Camelot to tell the truth.Mr Walker previously insisted to The Sun Online that he had nothing to hide and knows the card hasnt been tampered with.Following coverage of his plight which has gone viral, Mr Walker said today: People are slating me. I am getting destroyed at the moment and I have done nothing wrong.The talk now is all about me, I dont need this. I am going to the shops and people are talking about me, I have done nothing wrong. I feel like I have been dragged into the mud and I am not that person.Unemployed Mr Walker, who buys six scratchcards a day, believes there was a misprint on the scratchcard after he matched three symbols.He has invited cops to his home to have a look at the ticket and says he is the one being cheated.But Camelot has refuted the claim the altered card is a result of a misprint after launching an investigation into the issue.A spokesperson said: Based on the photo we were sent we were able to reconstruct the scratchcard in our system.We can confirm that an F has been altered to appear as an E and is therefore not a winning Scratchcard.The scratchcard has not been recalled and we will be reporting this matter to the police.Angela Mason, , is devastated and has accused the lotto giant of “cheating” her out of “le-changing” money.Angela, from Willenhall, West Mids, bought a Pharaoh’s Fortune card last month - the same one which Eric Walker has this week been accused of doctoring.She told The Sun Online: “At the Post Office they put in the code over and over again, but it wasn’t working. Everyone I had showed it to said it was a winner, but I emailed Camelot and five days later they replied and said I hadn’t scratchedoff properly.“If I had scratched off any more the card would have been wrecked.”Camelot told Angela one of her ‘winning’ grid codes was an E - not the F that she had scratched – meaning the three symbols she revealed did not match up."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000456139517.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ex army medic universal credit","story":"Former combat medic Daniel Johnson had his benefits cut when the Department for Work and pensions declared him fit to work - despite his severe neck pain and PTSD.The -year-old, who served with the Royal Army Medical Corps, now only gets £ a week - but £ is used to cover bills and food.It means Daniel, from Leominster, Herts. has to make ends meet on just £ a week.The dad-of-three raged: Its outrageous - the government is expecting me to live on £ a week.I have been living like this since June this year and it makes me feel worthless. Nobody who served their country should be treated like this.They are superseding a consultant, a GP and mental health professionals who are saying Im unfit for work.I have an A folder full of doctors notes saying that Im not able to work.Im still taking very high doses of morphine, no-one taking that much morphine would be fit for work let alone with PTSD issues Ive been diagnosed with.How am I going to live on £ a week especially at this time of year Daniel was diagnosed with PTSD in  after seven years of military service.He worked as a lorry driver until a load from one of the lorries fractured three vertebra in his neck.He has now been forced to take on casual work as a lorry driver to pay for food.He added: I was declared unfit to work by the doctors because of the amount of morphine I was on.During the health assessment I had in June this year they asked me questions like, can I stand unaided , can I sit unaided  and can I make a cup of tea unaided I cant really without being in a lot of pain - but with my military background you just try and get on with it.When Ive reached out for help from the country I served - Im being told no sorry, its tough luck.A DWP spokeswoman said: We deeply value the service of our veterans and provide special provision for them and their families through the Armed Services Covenant.We’re committed to ensuring that disabled people get the full support that they need.

I hope the EU council understands it. There will be no third country more important than the UK.”His predecessor Romano Prodi has also said the EU could give ground.But it will take more than vague promises.

They need to do far more when it comes to outreach, actually visiting isolated and deprived areas and talking to children years before they start thinking about university.Otherwise, a child growing up in a community where very few people have a degree will believe university just isn’t for them.The top universities all have their own outreach policies, and don’t work together to reach particularly under-represented parts of the country, which means entire towns can often end up being ignored.The political world doesn’t help, either. A young, white, working-class boy might not think he fits into the current Parliament, and so a vicious cycle of the same sort of people from the same sort of backgrounds going into politics continues. We know all the figures about the percentage of MPs who went to private schools , or that  prime ministers were schooled at Eton.But what we are less likely to realise is that there are entire towns in this country that have never, ever had an MP who was born and schooled locally.Or that the cost of getting into politics means thatyou are from a working-class background, your only hope of becoming an MP is landing a well-paid job first. And that tends to be easieryou’ve been to university.MPs tend to recruit their researchers straight from university. Researchers go on to become special advisers or take other political jobs before becoming MPs, so the political gene pool is articially shallow from the beginning.It’s handy to have MPs who hail from all kinds of backgrounds, but especially useful to have people who grew up in tough circumstances.When governments make mistakes, it is usually the most vulnerable people who suffer first. A Parliament of old Etonians can’t always instinctively realise when a policy is going to cause trouble.I don’t need to tell you that the current Parliament isn’t working very well.From those at the top of government who have failed to take big decisions on Brexit, to the backbenchers who have been busy plotting away, a lot of people in Westminster seem to be lacking a sense of perspective.This week the drama has all been about Brexit, but the infighting means that serious policy problems on social care, domestic abuse and, yes, education are largely ignored.If we made it easier for any bright kid from any background to get to university, perhaps we would have more competition for Parliamentary seats — and end up with better politicians.SoDamian Hinds got his way with universities, he’d be putting the future mediocre politicians out of a job.There might even be entire weeks in politics when you’d have a chance of noticing comments made by the Education Secretary, rather than being distracted by the self-indulgent way in which politicians of all persuasions have ended up conducting themselves.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

disappear overnight, as automated tools arent perfect and sometimes miss or misidenty images while searching for porn.Mr D’Onofrio added that humans as well as automated tools would be employed to

latest","story":"Here is our guide to the plan and what it means for Northern Ireland and its border with the Republic of Ireland.The backstop plan is essentially a safety netthere is no Brexit trade deal.It would avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.The backstop will see Britain remain in the customs union for as long as necessary until an alternative way of keeping the border open is found.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.It is unclearthe UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries while the backstop endured.On November , EU leaders approved an agreement on the UKs withdrawal from the EU.MPs were due to vote on the deal in Parliament on December  but the PM announced she was delaying the vote.A vote of no confidence was then made against the Prime Minister but she won the leadership vote with an  majority.The unpopular backstop measure may have been one of the contributors to the vote of no confidence.After winning the vote of no confidence, May has gone back to Brussels to beg for a better Brexit deal.She has agreed that she needs to amend the backstop and will attempt to do that in the coming days.She will attempt to reopen negotiations with Brussels about the Irish border backstop, however they have said negotiations are now closed.On December , it was revealed May had been handed a worse Brexit deal by the EU.The PM went to Brussels where she has been lobbying European chiefs to change the hated backstop which looks set to doom the deal.In early December Attorney General Geoffrey Cox was ordered to publish all the legal advice hed given Mrs May on her proposed deal - after he only handed over a summary.It concluded the proposed backstop would stop Britain making trade deals around the world in a separate legal document.After the refusal to publish the full legal advice, the government were found to be in contempt of Parliament on December  for the first time in history.Theresa May lost a crucial Commons vote by  to  over her refusal to publish the full legal advice on her EU deal.Conceding defeat moments after the vote, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom agreed to publish the “final and full” legal advice that Mr Cox gave to the Cabinet as they deliberated the EU deal.A motion tabled by Labour, the SNP, other opposition parties and the DUP, argued ministers were in contempt due to their failure to fully publish advice given to Cabinet by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped. At the start of a key debate in Parliament on her Brexit plan, the Prime Minister said the backstop was not a trap for Britain.The backstop is not a trick to trap us in the EU, said Mrs May.It actually gives us some important benefits of access to the EUs market without many of the obligations and that is something the EU will not want to let happen, let alone persist for a long time.Former Brexit secretaries David Davis and Dominic Raab have also unveiled their own alternative Brexit plan, which includes scrapping the Northern Irish backstop altogether.They would instead try to replace it with a ten-year extendable agreement involving free trade in goods, no tarfs and technology-based border control."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT0004497240581-e1544721699396.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"gary lineker blasted for flaunting views on

One said: “The Chancellor wasn’t looking to pick a fight with anyone – just to find a way forward.”Brexiteers have long viewed the Chancellor as their biggest enemy – accusing him of steering Theresa May towards a ‘soft’ Brexit and dragging his heels on spending money on No Deal preparation.The Sun earlier this month revealed Mr Hammond was allocating £billion to government departments to help tool up for a No Deal.But it also displayed staggering ­contempt for politicians committed to honouring the referendum and the election manesto on which they stood.Politics has been debased by charlatans making promises they dump as soon as it’s convenient. It is in a critical stateNOT doing so is “extreme”.If there are extremists in Parliament besides the obvious, Corbyn and McDonnell, it is those playing roulette with national stability by attempting to stage a second referendum before the verdict of the first is carried out.It is incredible that it is considered mainstream, noble even, of these MPs to renege on promises they made and votes they cast — and to refuse to honour the majority’s will because the losing minority must have their “final say”.All while performing intellectual ­contortions to justy what, deep down, they know is unjustiable: imposing their will over the public’s.That is a far more extreme position than anything on the Tory backbenches.“Everyone knows who won,” says ­Benedict Cumberbatch in the trailer for Channel ’s upcoming Brexit movie.We do. Some MPs have forgotten. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000456170436-e1544732666952.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may commons vote date january 14","story":"The PM dramatically abandoned the ‘Meaningful Vote’ scheduled for Tuesday - after MPs had already debated it for three days.She took the unprecedented step after admitting she was on course to lose heavily.Yesterday No confirmed the vote would not be held before Christmas but “as soon as possible” in January.Cabinet sources told The Sun that they are planning to hold the Commons vote on the first day possible after MPsfrom their Christmas break.But they have conceded that they will be forced to start the process again by holding a full five days of debate running up to the vote - instead of resuming where they left off last week.That process would start on Monday January  - and culminate with a vote a week later on January , Cabinet sources said.The Government has committed to holding it before January .But the possibility of an emergency EU summit in January could push back the vote further.

I do find it uncomfortable there’s an impression perhaps in the UK that it’s for the EU to propose solutions.“It’s the UK leaving the EU and I’d have thought it was rather more up to the British Government to tell us exactly what they want.”Afterwards, a fuming EU official said: “All she did was ask the EU for help.”EU Council chief Donald Tusk added the PM had come seeking reassurances over the backstop but that the deal “is not open for renegotiation”.Minutes earlier, leaders scrapped a commitment to throw Mrs May a leline over the backstop at the insistence of the Irish.A draft version of their summit conclusions had said the EU would “stand ready to examine whether any further assurance can be provided”.But the wording was deleted completely from the final dossier published last night.After a three-hour Brexit debate they also deleted wording from their summit conclusions which said it would only last for a “short period”.But member states threw the PM a small leline by responding to her plea for an aspirational start date for a future trade deal.Earlier, French President Emmanuel Macron also insisted it was up to Mrs May to find a political solution.Meanwhile Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez and Irish Premier Leo Varadkar both remained deeply sceptical any agreement could be reached on the hated backstop.Sources told The Sun that in face-to-face talks on Tuesday Mr Tusk had already flatly rejected the PM’s plea to put a one-year deadline on the backstop. It was understood that after testing the waters with him, the PM was much more conciliatory in a later meeting with Mr Juncker.One EU diplomat said: “May wanted a guarantee that the backstop could only last a year. We said no way.“The problem is the word backstop is burned — however we deal with it, the meaning of the word has become bad.”However, splits began to emerge between EU leaders as Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz offered the olive branch of an emergency Brexit summit next month to agree “additional assurances” for the UK.Ex-Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso called on the EU to show some “flexibility” and find a creative solution to the backstop.And Luxembourg PM Xavier Bettel said: “I really want to help her.”But Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaitė said Mrs May does not know what she wants.She tweeted a picture of a chocolate Christmas tree with the message: “Brexit Christmas wish — finally decide what you really want and Santa will deliver.”German Chancellor Angela Merkel also repeated her view that she “does not see that this ­Withdrawal Agreement can be changed”.Meanwhile Mr Varadkar was ridiculed for suggesting Britain should lt the threat of No Deal by suspending the Article  process which sets the deadline to leave.He said: “It is possible,the UK wishes to, to revoke Article  or,that is a step too far, to seek an extension of Article  so that the UK Parliament has more time to come together and decide what they would like the outcome to be.“It is absolutely within the gt of the United Kingdom to take No Deal off the tablethey wish to.”Mrs May was given only ten minutes to make her pitch — appealing for all sides to work together “intensively” to get the deal over the line — before she was kicked out of a ­dinner for the remaining  EU nations’ leaders. They were able to ask questions before discussing her plans without her present. She warned it was their joint responsibility to change MPs minds on the backstop — ­otherwise the deal was at risk.MR Juncker risked infuriating Brexiteers by wearing a green tie to show his support for Ireland in its backstop battle.His spokeswoman said: “He has always expressed solidarity with Ireland.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A phenomenon you’ll be well aware of,you watch television or engage with Twitter.The Last Leg’s Adam Hills, for instance, is a helluvaguy. So are presenters like Nish Kumar, James O’Brien and all those other blokes who cannot stop wanging on, very publicly, about their feminist credentials and just how much they love the NHS.While others might rely simply on empty words though, Nick Knowles preferred grand heroic gestures, right from day one in the jungle when he threw himself into the water to save four women who were in absolutely no danger of drowning.The idea that Nick Knowles was every woman’s Sir Galahad, was clearly never in doubt then. At least not in his own mind.The ever-so-slightly deluded David Brent-side to his character did not fully emerge, though, until the very last week when James McVey revealed Nick’s version of Make You Feel My Love had gone to number one in the iTunes chart.A stroke of genius for production to let the news slip, obviously, and for someone to send an acoustic guitar into camp, so that Nick could delight everyone with an unplugged rendition, which Emily Atack described as “a viral moment,” much like Ebola.Dec was clearly having the time of his le poking fun at Knowles as well, describing him as: “So good at DIY he’s even gravelled his voice.”I need nearly hardly tell you what happened next then.The public got rid of Nick Knowles, just as they get rid of any jungle contestant who’s ever shown the slightest inclination to act like an entertaining jerk.This is a problem that dates right back to series one, of course, when livewires Uri Geller, Darren Day, Rhona Cameron and Nigel Benn were all voted out before silent Nell McAndrew, and it continues to prevent a genuinely great line-up from turning into a genuinely great series, eventhis one did end with exactly the right winner in Harry Redknapp.I don’t see any way round the problem, either. The voting public just seems to prefer self-absorbed young bores, on “a journey,” to genuine characters.If any of us thought Nick Knowles was finished, the moment Dec read out his name, though, we reckoned without an eviction interview which will surely take its place in I’m A Celeb . . .  folklore.For it turns out Nick Knowles wasn’t in the jungle for purely personal or financial gain.It was to heal a ided nation.“We’re having such a hard time in the UK,” he told Dec, alluding to Brexit, “I thought,we can get on, it might be a bit of a pointer to the nation.”Gee, thanks Nick. I had been wondering why a cane toad was sat on your head, during the Wicked Warehouse task, but it’s beginning to make sense now. He wasn’t finished either.“I’d like to say one last thing.” Go on . ..“Please support veterans, support the police, support the NHS, support the emergency services.They have it a lot harder, on a day to day basis, than we have it in here.”A hell-of-a-claim to make when you’ve reportedly just been paid £, to sit around a television set, in Australia, with John Barrowman, but then Nick Knowles is clearly a helluvaguy.SO there was Gemma Collins behaving like a monstrous old boot as usual, last week, when fellow BBC diner Adrian Chiles silenced her with a simple question.“Is there anything you can’t stop eating ”At which point you could see Gemma disengaging from the conversation as she ran through the checklist: “Cakes, buns, crisps, Pringles, biscuits, pies, potatoes, cows, pigs, horses, breeze blocks, deep-fried landfill, light aircraft . . . ”The silence couldn’t last forever, obviously, but it was a nice  seconds on BBC’s I’ll Get This, a celeb dinner party show, that I hadn’t really seen the point of up until the arrival of Chiles, who has a streak of honesty that’s very rare among presenters.Even by Adrian’s own standards, though, his response to the question “Why would you make the best chat show host ” was brutally self-aware.“For a huge amount of money, a big hullabaloo, billboards everywhere, I went to ITV and did another chat show, Daybreak, at which I was s**t.“I failed abysmally, humiliatingly. I looked miserable, I was sullen, I sat there like a bag of potatoes, I dragged everyone down with me, from the moment I walked in the door at am.“SoI ever get the chance to host another chat show, let’s be honest, unlikely, I will be the best chat show host ever, ’cos I know what it’s like to succeed and I know what it’s like to fail, dismally.”A confession that I expected to be met with stunned silence but it was actually greeted by spontaneous applause, from fellow celebs, and a faint whirring noise from Gemma Collins’ brain: “Doritos, kebabs, dips, mini eclairs, maxi eclairs, Jenny Eclairs . . . ”I PARTED company with Celebrity Antiques Road Trip the moment the commentator announced: “Russell Kane’s heading for an auction at Penkridge.”Anyone know how much he fetched UK’S Strongest Man. Best dead-weight lt was, of course, won by Declan Donnelly . . .  who carried about  kilos for three weeks.FRANCE is burning, Paris is in lockdown and its government’s on the brink.So how many mentions do you think TV’s fearlessly impartial satirical news shows, Have I Got News For You, The Mash Report and The Last Leg, gave it, on Friday Correct. None. Because these inconvenient facts don’t fit the narrative and agenda of the BBC and Channel , which believe Britain is a basket case and Europe is our only salvation.So it was simply ignored and all three proceeded with the same lazy and witless anti-Brexit and Trump routines they go with every week.There were some slight iations with the other material, obviously.The Last Leg and HIGNFY, ably hosted by Danny Dyer, both invited lists to be outraged by alleged sexism at the Ballon D’Or awards, held in Paris, ironically.While the final Mash Report of the series offered Rachel Parris lecturing viewers about poverty, as only a privately-educated, Oxbridge graduate truly can, before smug-bucket in chief Nish Kumar closed the show by saying: “We’ll be back next year,the will of the people demands it.”Which is almost the very last thing the will of the people will ever demand.The Mash Report will be back, though.

The Prime Minister had begged them to give ground on the Irish backstop as she faces a battle to get her Brexit deal through Parliament. But European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker rejected her plea to put a -month limit on the unpopular insurance plan to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The top eurocrat accused the UK of being nebulous and imprecise as he savaged the PMs attempts to unblock the stalemate that has thrown her Brexit plans - and her government - into disarray.   We dont want the UK to think there can be any form of renegotiation, that is crystal clear. We can add clarications but no real changes, he said. “Our UK friends need to say what they want, rather than asking what we want, he said.   It came as one former Cabinet minister claimed the Tories could be heading for a terminal split after Mrs May saw off the vote of no confidence. The PM had downplayed expectations of what she could achieve. Arriving at the summit, she said: “I don’t expect an immeshydiate breakthrough. What I do hope is we can start work as quickly as possshyible on assurances that are necessary.”   But Mrs May was unprepared for the exasperation of EU leaders who insisted repeatedly they would not reopen talks on the withdrawal agreement. They rallied round Irish premier, Leo Varadkar, who ruled out more concessions. After a y meeting with the PM, he said: “As the European Union we are very keen to offer explanations, assurances, clarications... anything that may assist MPs to understand the agreement and, hopefully, support it. But the backstop is not on the table.” Brussels sources said the PM told EU chiefs at a crunch meeting that she needed legally binding guarantees the backstop was temporary to get her deal through the Commons. Mrs May told the  leaders she believed there was a majority in Parliament to secure a deal, even though she called off a vote this week to avoid defeat. Begging for political and legal assurshyances, she said: “We have to change the perception that the backstop could be a trap from which the UK could not escape. Until we do, the deal – our deal – is at risk.” They told her they had already written in enough guarantees into the orce deal and asked what  she needed - but she was unable to answer. As a result, EU leaders toughened up their official Brexit conclusions.   In a blunt rejection, French Presishydent Emmanuel Macron said: “The legal framework and agreement negoshytiated are not supposed to change.” And German Chancellor Angela Merkel added: “I do not see that the withdrawal agreement can be changed.”   It was reminiscent of the humiliating ambush at the Salzburg summit in September when EU leaders unexpectedly declared that her proposals would not work. No  confirmed the MPs vote on the deal would take place after Christmas. Meanwhile, Tory Brexiteers contshyinued their war of attrition, despite Mrs May confirming she would not lead the party into the next election. It comes after she held off Wednesshyday’s challenge by  votes to . A Eurosceptic source said: “The campshyaign of guerilla warfare will continue.”   Exshy-Cabinet Minister Nicky Morgan warned: “There’s an inevitability the hardest Brexiteers are going to walk. There may be some sort of reconfigushyration of parties on the right... That may be something we’re going to have to accept to get a Brexit deal through.” The chances of Labour tabling a vote of no confishydence in the PM next week increased after the summit failure. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: “What we want is a deal that protects jobs and the economy. If the Prime Minister can’t secure that deal, we’ll see on Monday.” A Labour Party official said they are judging things “day by day”.

For most mothers, the  week mark of a pregnancy is usually signied with a scan - but for Christie Malik it marked the beginning of her labour. Giving birth at just  weeks and one day into her pregnancy, Ayah, was born in February  weighing just lb and oz. Doctors gave her a % chance of survival. They said evenshe did survive, the likelihood of her having severe and wide-ranging disabilities was almost a certainty.   But Ayah – which means “amazing miracle” in Arabic – started to beat the odds that day and has continued ever since, hitting all her developmental milestones.Christie said the incredible staff at the neonatal intensive care unit at the University Hospital of Wales ensured Ayah is now thriving.“What greater achievement is there than to save someone’s le, especially one that was given little or no chance of survival ” said Christie, from Pontypridd, told WalesOnline. “Having spent months in hospital watching other families whose outcomes weren’t as good as ours, I think about how lucky we are every day. “I could have had a very dferent le, I’d prepared myself for a very dferent le, but Ayah showed me dferently. She’s perfect.” Christie said she was overjoyed when her and her partner, Wajahat, found out they were expecting. The couple had been trying for a baby since their second daughter, Aaliyah, was stillborn at  weeks in  and had started to think that it would never happen for them.Their joy, understandably given their previous experience, was also mixed with worry.   Christie tried her best to enjoy her pregnancy though and felt reassured that her regular checks and scans revealed a growing, healthy baby each time. At their -week scan, the couple couldn’t agree whether to find out the baby’s gender and in the end Wajahat chose to, under the strict condition that he wouldn’t tell Christie. As it turned out, Christie didn’t have to wait long to find out for herself. Christie said: “We were decorating the house when I first realised that I was bleeding. “I was only  weeks and five days pregnant at that point and I knew full well that babies born that early do not survive. “I tried not to panic and rang my midwe who told me to go straight to the hospital for an examination. “I knew straight away from the medical team’s faces that things were bad, but I didn’t realise how bad until they told me I was cm dilated. “There was nothing they could do to stop the labour because I was too far gone.” Christie and Wajahat were put in a room where a consultant told them what they already knew.  A baby born this early had less than a % chance of survival andit did survive, would probably be severely disabled. It was highly unlikely that the baby would even be born alive and would officially be classed as a miscarriage. “We were basically being told that there was no hope and at that point I was swaying wildly between blind panic and a feeling of total numbness,” said Christie. “Losing Aaliyah had been devastating and I knew I just didn’t have the strength to go through it all again. “But that was the situation we were in, with all that horror ahead of us.” Christie was transferred to Swansea where for a while nothing much more happened. But on the evening of the second day, still at only  weeks and one day of pregnancy, her waters broke and within minutes baby Ayah was born weighing a tiny lb oz. “We’d begged them in advance to at least try and help Ayahshe was born alive and they agreed as long as she was showing signs of le and trying to breathe for herself. “They took her to the corner of the room immediately and after what felt like an age, the doctor turned around and gave us the thumbs up. “We saw her for only a few seconds before she was taken away and all I can honestly remember thinking was ‘how possibly can something that tiny survive ’ She would have fitted with room to spare in to the palm of my hand. “There was no honeymoon period that you often hear about after a premature baby is born. “We went straight into a grade three and four bleed on her brain which we were told were very potentially lethal. “I couldn’t bring myself to leave her side for a minute, I wanted to savour every second I was going to have with her. “But the whole time, I couldn’t get the image of burying her out of my head. I’d been through losing a baby before and I wouldn’t wish that pain on anyone, but the emotional pain of having your baby alive in front of you but knowing that you could lose her literally at any second is a level of pain I can only describe as numbing.”  Over the next few days baby Ayah was hit with pretty much every complication possible. And at the two week point, Christie and Wajahat were again taken into a room to discuss placing a shunt in Ayah’s head to relieve the pressure on her brain. They were also told that, should she survive the bleeds, Ayah would probably be severely disabled. “At that point I started to wonder whether I was being selfish to want her to stay alive. “I wondered whether she was in pain and whether she had the strength to endure it all. “On the one hand I knew that whatever the outcome,she lived, I would cope with anything because all I wanted was for her to be with us. “But on the other hand I couldn’t bear the thought of her suffering. “I only ever left Ayah’s side to eat and sleep and I couldn’t even do either of those without constant anxiety. “The nights away from her were the worst. We’d get a phone call in the middle of the night to say that something had changed and we needed to go in. “I would completely freak out every time thinking this was it, that we were losing her. We were always on guard, always waiting for the next terrible thing to happen.” Over the following weeks, the bleed on Ayah’s brain did begin to resolve itself. And although she continued to face many obstacles – like the struggle to withdraw her from the ventilator – Ayah got through every one. In June, she was well enough to be referred to the consultant ophthalmologist, Dr Patrick Watts, for an operation to correct the retinopathy of prematuritywhich could have caused blindness in both her eyes. But after more rigorous examination, it was decided that the procedure would be postponed to see whether the condition would correct itself – and it did. Over the weeks and months that followed, Ayah continued to grow in strength.  Her mum and dad spent that time talking and singing to her, telling her how loved and amazing she was. After  weeks and transfers to four dferent hospitals for ious types of care and procedures, the miracle baby who was given less than a % chance of survival went home entirely able to breathe and eat by herself. Christie says she begged their consultant to let them go home with a sensor that would alarmAyah stopped breathing, but after a week they put it away. Despite the fact their daughter had done so well, Christie and Wajahat knew many of the problems that could emerge as a result of Ayah’s early birth could do so over time. One of the brain bleeds had left a cyst on Ayah’s brain which the medical team had warned may cause cerebral palsy, so she was referred for an intensive course of physiotherapy the moment she left the hospital. “Ayah was so small and helpless that her body couldn’tindependently at all without the machines that kept her alive. “The complications and medical challenges these babies face are shocking. “I’ve seen it with my own eyes and I still can’t believe it. “Ayah’s means ‘amazing miracle’ in Arabic and her middle name, Aydah means ‘ing gt’ which I think sums her up perfectly. “I’m not a religious person but I remember feeling very strongly that Aaliyah was watching over us during the most dficult times. “I’d often speak to her and ask her to send us a rainbowshe was there and I can honestly say that I’ve never seen so many rainbows than I did during that time. “I remember breaking down in the shower one evening just filled with this overwhelming feeling that I couldn’t cope with losing another baby like Aaliyah, and when I walked into the bedroom after there was the biggest brightest rainbow outside our window.”  Christie, Wajahat and Ayah’s adoring big sister Aisha now dote on -month-old Ayah and can’t wait to spend Christmas with her. Like many babies born prematurely, Ayah developed a condition called retinopathy of prematurity , a potentially blinding disease which is caused by the abnormal development of blood vessels in a baby’s eye. As part of its support of the Noah’s Ark Charity Tiny Lives Appeal, clothing and accessories company Primark recently donated pound, to fund a specialist imaging device which allows clinicians to identy and diagnose vision disorders in newborn babies. The PanoCam takes a complete and detailed image of both the surface and sub-surface of the eye, helping to detect conditions like ROP and also retinoblastomawhich,undetected, can be le-threatening. Noah’s Ark Charity director Suzanne Mainwaring said: “Primark are long-term supporters of the charity having partnered with us on the very initial stages of the children’s hospital’s build. “In the last two years alone they have donated a total of pound, to the Tiny Lives Appeal, which is a massive contribution to the poundm target that we are so close now to achieving.” "},{"url":null,"title":"couple refused room doubletree hilton","story":"NewsCouple claim staff deemed them not posh enough to stay in Hilton DoubleTree hotelAdrian Nellist, , attempted to stay at the DoubleTree by Hilton hotel but claims he was told he could not spend the nightShareCommentsByTom Kershaw:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsThe incident ruined Adrian Nellists birthday celebrations \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man claims he and his girlfriend were refused a room at a city centre hotel on his birthday because staff deemed them not posh enough. And Andiran Nellist, , says staff at the DoubleTree by Hilton hotel probably thought he had picked his girlfriend up off the street. When Mr Nellist tried to pay for a room at the hotel in Hull city centre as a treat for himself and Martine Moore he says he was challenged on how he could pay for it.He was then told he could not stay, he told the Hull Daily Mail.Adrian was celebrating a rare night out with his -year-old girlfriend but due to the chilly temperatures, decided he did not want to stick around to wait for a taxi.   Instead, he decided to stop in town for the night and ventured inside the poundm complex, which is run and managed by a separate hospitality management company, at am to book a room. He was then told no rooms were available by a member of staff - although Adrain says there were ten available rooms listed on the internet when searching for a place to stay. Adrian, a recovery driver, believes it was because he was not dressed smart enough - despite wearing a shirt and shoes. The hotel says it is aware of the situation but that safety of guests were the main priority. Adrian said: It destroyed my birthday night out, it really did. Its disgraceful. I could not believe I was pre-judged like this. I was challenged on how I could pay for the room and I said on my card and showed him receipts. Martine was getting dirty looks from the staff - she looked great and they probably thought I had picked her up off the street or something. Martine said: It felt absolutely disgusting and getting the mucky looks - it kind of made me feel like I wasnt good enough or posh enough, to stay there. Adrian ended up spending the night at the nearby Ibis hotel but ed to the DoubleTree in the morning to find out why he was not allowed a room. He claims staff appeared more bothered about how they were going to pay and said they seemed worried about cash walk-ins. But Adrian, who felt upset over the incident, believes it was because he was not good enough, or posh enough, to sleep at the hotel. Adrian, explained: Basically, it was my first time off in a while and it was birthday and we never go out so we decided to have a night out in town. We went to Propaganda and it was freezing so at about am we decided we wouldnt wait for a taxi and wed pop into Hilton to get a room as a treat because it was my birthday. When I got to the desk the night staff told me that they didnt have any rooms available without even looking at the computer or phone. But when I checked on my phone there were  rooms available. Martine added: It just felt asAdrian had just picked me up off the street on a night out. They didnt even check the system for rooms and just seemed too bothered about how we could pay. Hilton says the DoubleTree branch, which opened in December , is managed by a separate hospitality management company called Leaf Hospitality. A spokesman for Leaf Hospitality said: We are aware of the situation and were unfortunately unable to accommodate this request. The safety and security of our guests is our primary concern.

Unemployed doorman Eric Walker, , claims he won the money on a pound Pharoahs Fortune card three weeks ago but Camelot refused to pay up. Lottery organisers yesterday confirmed police had been called and were dealing with the incident. But Mr Walker said cops can do what they want and he wont back down because it would take an expert to doctor a scratchcard. The dad-of-four told Sun Online: I have nothing to hide because I havent done anything wrong, I know the card hasnt been tampered with. The police can show me how the card has been altered because I cant see it. They can do what they want. I dont have the skills to fake a scratchcard, youd have to be some sort of expert to pull that off.   Mr Walker yesterday said he has been left traumatised by Camelots decision. That scratchcard has not been doctored. Im not that bright to be honest with you, he told The Mirror on Wednesday. The dad-of-four claims he should have been facing a fantastic Christmas but instead fears he could end up having a heart attack because of all the stress. Mr Walker contacted Camelot in November after scratching three matching symbols on the National Lotterys pound a time Pharoahs Fortune card. On the scratchcard sixteen co-ordinates are given, which are used to scratch off the corresponding squares on a grid in the hope of matching three pharoah symbols. But lottery organisers Camelot said they have investigated and it was a non-winning Scratchcard.   They refused to pay up saying that one of the co-ordinates on the card was altered as winning co-ordinate F appears to have been changed to an E. But Mr Walker denies the scratchcard was doctored and says it must be the result of a misprint. He explained how his partner Amanda Emmadi, , scratched the card off to reveal three winning pharoahs. She was staring at the ticket for two hours, she was traumatised because she couldnt believe what was happening in front of her, he said. I had to pull the card out of her hand and then saw the same thing and she was seeing. Its a winner. However, within hours, he said Camelot had put a dampener on their joy.   Mr Walker insisted: I can assure you nobody has altered it and nobody has tampered with it. That cards been put away and is still put away. I wont even let my girlfriend touch it, I know its her card and everything. When asked why the scratchcard appears dferent in two pictures, one taken by Eric and the other by a photographer, he told The Mirror: I understand what youre saying..it does look dferent. But nobody has done anything to that card. Asked about why so many squares had been scratched off, he said: There are two more now that have been scratched off. When Camelot says it wasnt E, it was F, we scratched F off. And when asked why the random E had been scratched off he said: I dont know why. I will have to go back and have a look at the card. A Camelot spokesman yesterday confirmed that an investigation had been launched and it was found that a co-ordinate had been altered. But Mr Walker is refusing to back down and says that the money would be le changing for him and his partner.   He said: How can they investigate when they havent seen the card themselves. They can come here to look at it because Im not posting it or letting it out of my sight. Mr Walker, who buys six scratchcards a day, has children aged between  months and nine-years-old. He said: In my eyes Ive won pound, and Im being cheated out of the money. I havent doctored it, Im not trying to cheat. Im no angel but I wouldnt cheat.” He still insists he won the jackpot fair and square adding: If its a misprint then thats their fault and they should still pay out, its nothing to do with me. Mr Walker bought the scratchcard from a Premier corner shop near his house three weeks ago. A Camelot spokesperson said they were contacted through their general enquiries email address and it was not escalated to their prize claims team as there was no claim to be dealt with. They said: We were able to re-construct the Scratchcard in our system. We can confirm that an F has been altered to appear as an E, and is therefore not a winning Scratchcard.

Kate Middleton headed through the palace gates in a Range Rover, raising a hand to wave at onlookers as she passed by. But what was really interesting about the moment, was that Kate, , was seen driving herself to the home of her grandmother-in-law, The Queen. This is because members of the royal family are very rarely seen out and about driving their own cars, and instead are often chauffeured to official engagements. However royal etiquette expert, William Hanson, recently told The Express that modern royalty tend to drive themselves to private parties and events.So its very likely that Kate was just dropping by for a casual visit.And according to HELLO! the Duchess often visits Buckingham to use the Queens swimming pool, which is where her children have been learning how to swim.The publication went on to suggest that her children, Princess Charlotte and baby Prince Louis may have been accompanying her on the visit, as the cars rear windows were blacked-out. Footage of the mum-of-three behind the wheel was shared on Instagram by a user called melissagrflx, who was out exploring London for the day.She shared it along with several shots of herself and captioned the post: At Buckingham Palace. When youre so lucky to get a shot of Kate Middleton right when she gets to the palace. So far over  people have liked her clip. In the video, Kate looks stunning as ever, dressed in a cream top, with her long dark hair down.  This isnt the first time this year a member of the Royal Family has hit the headlines because of a car. Back in September Meghan Markle sent royal fans into a frenzy when she was filmed closing her own car door - something The Queen never does. The Duchess of Sussex was attending her first solo engagement at the time - the opening of the Oceania exhibit at the Royal Academy of Arts. People on social media were quick to praise Meghan for doing something so normal. One person said: A princess who still takes the time to shut her car door. Well done Meghan! Another commented: I don’t think Meghan Markle sees herself as better than anyone . She knows that she and Prince Harry are blessed to have found each other. I’m proud of her. Le is good.

Social media influencer Sophie Hinchlfe, of Essex, has previously recommended household disinfectant Zoflora as one of her top products. Shoppers have even complained about not being able to find it on shelves - claiming Mrs Hinch is to blame as people are trying to emulate her spotless home. But vets have warned that a detergent in the solution can be particularly toxic to cats leading to hypersalvation and inappetence. Birmingham Live wrote recently how a vets had claimed a cat had become very poorly after coming into contact with Zoflora. Some branches of the veterinary practice VetsPets have since shared a product warning saying the product can cause burns to the tongue and swollen paws. But responding to the Birmingham Live article Zoflora said its products have been fully risk-assessed - adding surfaces should be completely dry before pets are allowed back on them.   The Veterinary Poisons Information Service told The Sun: Zoflora contains a detergent called benzalkonium chloride which is particularly toxic in cats and can cause oral and tongue ulceration, hypersalivation and inappetence. Cats roam between houses and therefore it is hard to keep them away from this product when it is often used to clean patios but owners need to be aware of the risks to animals. They usually lick their pawsthey have walked on freshly cleaned floors which then leads to signs of toxicity. Our advice is to use more natural productsyou have pets oryour pet has been exposed to something which is potentially harmful to call Animal PoisonLinefor advice as to what you need to do. In response to the previous claims, Zoflora said its products have been safely used in homes for the past  years.   A spokeswoman added: Zoflora’s products have been fully risked assessed by leading scientists at Exponent International, a long-established, independent consultancy company with expertise in all aspects of Biocidal Products Regulation and safety. The risk assessments conducted do not indicate a concern when the product is used in accordance with the on pack usage directions. Pets are required to be excluded from the area to be treated during application cover or remove terrariums, aquariums and animal cages prior to application. Treated surfaces should be completely dry before pets and companion animals are allowed in contact with the surfaces. Any adverse effects should be notied to Thornton  Ross and will be shared with the Health and Safety Executive .   Response from the Veterinary Poisons Information Service regarding the usage of Zoflora around pets also state that as long as directions for use are followed, and treated areas dried completely before animals have access to them, Zoflora is safe and effective to use. As with all disinfectants and other household chemicals, ensure that Zoflora is used safely. When correctly diluted, Zoflora disinfectant may be used where most pets are kept.

Jan Cruickshank, , said her bosses believed her colleagues side of the story, but she has finally been vindicated after winning a case of unfair dismissal. The Construction Industry Training Boardhas written an apology and agreed to pay her pound,. Jan, of Aberdeen, told the Daily Record she was sexually harassed by a co-worker for more than three years before he raped her. But her bosses believed his claim that they were having an affair, and she said she was sacked for apparently misusing company time. Married mum Jan, who has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, said: “You hear the same platitudes all the time - report rape, report sexual harassment at work, women will be listened to and treated as equals. “I was sexually harassed for more than three years. I reported it, I reported him exposing himself to me and sending me a photo of his genitals and I reported being raped. “But protecting his career seemed to be paramount. It didn’t matter about mine. That could go down the toilet because I was a woman. “I was sacked apparently for misuse of company time by having an affair.”   Jan says her colleague raped her in March . Police said there wasn’t enough evidence to bring rape charges, although Jan was awarded a four-figure sum in criminal injuries compensation. She ended up on sick leave and was subsequently sacked. She took CITB to an employment tribunal for unfair dismissal and they offered a pound, settlement. Jan refused to accept it and pressed ahead with the case. She only settled last month after CITB offered pound, and dropped demands for Jan to sign a confidentiality clause. Now free to reveal her ordeal, she said her legal battle was never about money - it was about exposing how CITB had treated her. Jan said: “There was never any way I was going to agree to be gagged. I was ready to risk everything to make sure I could tell anyone I wanted how I had been treated.” She said the harassment started shortly after she started as an apprenticeships officer at CITB. She added: “I loved my job and I was good at it. I didn’t mind being one of the lads and having a laugh and joke with colleagues. “This one guy was very complimentary to me and I liked working with him. But occasionally I had to slap him down when he crossed boundaries, telling me he fancied me and wanted me. Two months after I started, he sent me a text asking meI ‘fancied a f***’. “I made it clear that I loved my husband Rob, I had never been unfaithful to him in  years and had no intention of doing so now. “Usually, he backed off when he saw I was angry but the inappropriate behaviour always resumed. “Five months after the text, we were working in his home town and he took me to his house to collect something and asked me for a ‘quickie’. I refused. “In June , we were doing a careers event at Alford, Aberdeenshire, and he exposed himself to me at the hotel. “In August , he sent me a photograph of his private parts.”   Jan told how six weeks later, the colleague called her and committed a sex act while on the phone. She added: “On each occasion, I warned him off and he would back down. I told him we could be friends and colleagues but never anything . “I sometimes talked about his behaviour at work but didn’t want to make trouble for him. I thought I was handling it. “At the end of March , we were attending a conference and staying at a Highland hotel. He came to my room with a bottle of wine before we met colleagues for dinner. “I thought it was OK to have a glass of wine with my colleague because I had told him nothing would ever happen between us. But it wasn’t OK. “He wouldn’t listen. I was overwhelmed and I froze.” Jan said that she felt filthy and violated afterwards. But because she hadn’t fought him off, or screamed and shouted, she told herself it couldn’t have been rape. She added: “It didn’t make sense. I’d seen rape on Crimewatch. It was carried out by strangers with knives. “I hated myself for not stopping him. I couldn’t bear to look at my husband, the man I adored, because I felt like I had cheated on him. I was so ashamed.” After the incident, her colleague virtually stopped talking to her at work. They became hostile to one another. Jan finally reported him for sexual harassment and, following counselling, for rape. He told his employers he and Jan had been having an affair for three years and she was hitting back at him because he had ended it. Minutes of grievance meetings show her managers accused her of lying and they believed her colleague’s claims of an affair. One female manager even told her that “perhaps it was necessary to say no more than once”. Jan ended up on sick leave and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and later dismissed.  Police interviewed her colleague about the rape allegation and the claim that he had exposed himself to Jan. She said detectives told her he had given a “no comment” interview and without corroboration, he could not be charged. The indecent image he sent Jan was reported to the fiscal but it was decided that prosecution would not be in the public interest. However, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority found she had endured a “serious sexual assault” and awarded her a four-figure sum. Jan kept the rape from her husband for almost four months. But he knew something was wrong as she was drinking heavily and crying in bed at night. In a statement he made to CITB, Rob said he had seen a text message sent in November  to Jan’s phone saying: “Fancy a f*** ” The colleague later apologised to them both and excused himself by saying he had been drunk. Rob also outlined how Jan finally told him that her colleague had forced himself on her. He said: “Jan was inconsolable and I was very angry. She was confused and distraught and she called Rape Crisis. The woman listened and told her that she had no reason to feel guilty as she had been raped.” Jan said: “When I eventually told Rob, I felt like a weight was being released from my body. “I watched his face crumble as his le imploded and my heavy, filthy secret began to crush his soul instead. “Hurting him so badly tore my heart out and I wished I could snatch the secret back but it was too big, too heavy.” The CITB’s first offer of pound, to settle her claim for unfair dismissal without incurring the costs of a tribunal hearing was made in December last year. Lawyers for Jan’s union Unite and personal injury and employment experts Thompsons described it as “on the low side”. CITB offered pound,, still with conditions and no apology and Jan was advised to consider accepting. She refused. The offer went up to pound,. But Jan continued to make it clear to Thompsons and Unite that she would risk a tribunal to make the matter public, rather than be gagged. The offer was increased in stages until CITB agreed to drop the confidentiality clause and offered a written apology and pound,. Jan said: “It sounds like a lot but I’ve lost a lot more – my reputation, my career, a regular salary, a company car and I’ve incurred debt since unexpectedly losing my job. “I was good at my job, had good appraisals and earned management qualications, yet they pushed me until I was suicidal.” Emma Black, general counsel for CITB, said: “CITB and this former employee agreed a settlement to her claim prior to court proceedings. In accordance with our practice, we will not comment further on the details. “CITB are committed to providing a safe working environment to all their employees, treating all genders equally. “Wherever lessons can be learned across the organisation, CITB look to improve their policies and processes.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mums genius idea solves christmas","story":"NewsMum sells rearranged Quality Street tubs - so everyone gets their favouriteCaroline Jefferson, from Southwick, has set up a very clever Christmas business rearranging Quality Street tubsShareCommentsByRobyn DarbyshireAudience Writer:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsCaroline came up with a very clever solution \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWe all have our favourite Quality Street - and it can cause family rows around Christmas time.

Nina Marston, from Essex, visited Colchester Zoos late and much-loved orangutan Rajang after suffering with baby loss over a four-year period. The -year-old marketing manager says she struggled to see pregnant woman as she always wanted a family and was puzzled as to why she couldnt have a baby. Nina told Essex Live: Seeing pregnant women was dficult. Every time I saw someone it was hard because I always wanted a family. Even with my friends it was hard. My friends are so supportive but sometimes I didnt want to see them and they would understand.When their babies came along, that completely vanished but I really struggled seeing pregnant women. I tried not to let it show but its very hard. Its a lot easier to be jealous of other people who you dont know rather than your friends.  Nina suffered her first miscarriage shortly before her -week scan but was determined to try again. The -year-old said: The first miscarriage was a surprise, we didnt find out until the day before -week scan. The next two were dficult and then after that, you just want to know whats wrong. I talk quite openly about it and tell my friends just to treat me as normal. When I went back to work after my miscarriages, I told my colleagues not to be really nice to me. Im happy to talk about it, people dont have to pussy-foot around me. Doctors were determined to get to the bottom of Ninas heartache and finally Nina had the answer she was looking for. The mum discovered she had killer cells, which is when the body attempts to get rid of things it thinks shouldnt be there due to the high levels of antibodies. It often attacks and kills the embryo as it is seen as a foreign organism.  I had never heard of killer cells before but it tries to get rid of what it thinks shouldnt be there, Nina said. The staff at Broomfield Hospital were fantastic but for the first miscarriages you have to wait until to take a fertility test. I understand why but I just couldnt go through it again. When we actually got to the problem, the staff were excellent, they wouldnt give up at all. It was hard to speak to friends about it. Nina was put on medication and eventually became pregnant for the seventh time with her husband Lee. During my seventh pregnancy, I worried about everything, what I ate, what I drank, she said. You do get bleeding at the beginning but I was in a constant state of worry. I paid for extra scans so we werent waiting too long inbetween. You know its going to be fine but there is always that little but of doubt in the back of your head.  In a bid to try and settle her nerves, Nina visited Colchester Zoo - a place she has loved since she was a toddler - and paid a visit to Rajang. She continued: Ive been going to the zoo since I was four and five and Rajang was always my favourite. I go to the zoo probably once or twice a year now, I used to go along with my sister-in-law and I got her really involved in loving the zoo and Rajang and I saw him each time I went. When I had my first miscarriage, we went to Norfolk and we went to the zoo. Its a place where I can switch off. During my seventh pregnancy, I went with my friend and we just decided to go for a walk and get the baby moving so we decided to walk miles around the zoo. We got to Rajangs enclosure and there was a massive queue, but my friend was patient and waited with me until there was a gap. I lted up my top to show him my belly and he shuffled along the side and just gave it a big kiss. I just cried.  It was such an emotional moment, it was only a small thing but it meant a lot to me. I have seen him do it many times to people and I just always thought it was so lovely.I would have been devastatedhe hadnt done it. There were things I wanted to do while I was pregnant and that was one of them. Hes not that interested in kids, my godson tried but he wasnt interested. Rajang did do it to my husbands belly once though. To Nina and Lees delight, she gave birth to a healthy baby girl in November , named Elizabeth, who Nina calls her lucky number seven. Sadly, yesterday, Colchester Zoo sadly announced the death of -year-old Rajang, who proved to be a lucky charm when he planted a huge kiss on Ninas swollen belly. He passed away after suffering from chronic arthritis and other health problems that come with old age. In the last few months, Rajangs condition worsened and he began experiencing periods of losing focus similar to that of a degenerating neurological condition.  Despite best efforts from the veterinary team, Rajangs condition inevitably further deteriorated and the dficult decision was taken to end his suffering and put him to sleep. The orangutan was one of the most popular residents with both staff and visitors- including Nina, after first arriving in . Nina added: When I heard the news, I was a little bit tearful because I had seen him so many times over the years. I was quite emotional. He was such a massive part of the zoo, people have loved him for such a long time. I think, especially in the olden days, he was one of the first animals you saw and when his enclosure moved, everyone would make sure they saw him. It is a shame. I took my daughter to the zoo but she fell asleep so didnt get to see him. Its a shame shes not going to have those memories that I had as a child. When they are really young, they dont really understand whats going on. I will take her back and Im going to get annual passes, it is such a lovely place.  Following his death, thousands took to Colchester Zoos Facebook post, to share their fond memories of Rajang. One person wrote: So heartbreaking to hear! He was a true king of the swingers and a king among men. Shame to see him go, I always had fond memories of visiting him on school trips and learning the importance of conservation efforts to keep orangutans and their habitats alive. Rest in peace you gentle giant. Another wrote: This is literally the saddest news! Ive got a lump in my throat and tears streaming down my face. I was honored to get to meet Rajang last year and give him a big cup of tea . Its because of Rajang that I love orangutans so much. He connected with me and my middle daughter in  and we have loved him and orangutans ever since. He touched our souls when he looked back at us with those deep brown eyes and he really moved me. I always remember him being at the zoo since I was a little girl. He was always near the entrance. He may not have had any children but his legacy will always live on in those who remember and love him. RIP Rajang, you beautul boy. Visitors of the zoo shared fond memories of Rajang including him kissing pregnant bellies and playing Peek-a-boo with children.  Another person said: I have great memories of first meeting you as a child with my mum, watching people throwing bananas in  you passing them to others. I have grown up with you for  years! Youre a beautul soul. Thoughts are with your keepers. Such a horrible day! Colchester Zoo announced the sad news about Rajang on Wednesday and shared some special memories they have had of him. They said: All the animals in our care have their inidual personalities which we all fall in love with but Rajang was one of a kind with a personality so unique, fascinating, loving and interesting. Rajang always had a twinkle in his eye and despite orangutans not having the same facial muscles to express their emotions the way in which humans do, Rajang communicated with his keepers and visitors through his beautul eyes and expressions he would make with his mouth. Rajang always showed interest in people, and no doubt there will be a number of pregnant visitors who experienced Rajang ‘kissing’ their baby bumps, something he became world famous for through viral videos. Rajang would also copy his keepers’ actions, so much so that they would give him similar utensils to be able to fulfil the actions he was seeing Rajang cleaned his own windows and also done some gardening by putting a plant in a flower pot after watching the gardener! It’s moments like these that we will treasure forever. Thousands of people shared their pictures and stories they had with Rajang who has been a resident at the zoo since . One person commented: Always the highlight of my visit, I could spend ages just watching him doing nothing yet be spellbound by it. Rest well Raj, while another said: Rajang, you were beautul and gentle and you were literally my dream come true when I met you in April! RIP buddy. Rajang celebrated his th birthday on June  this year and to mark this special occasion the zoo commissioned an artist to draw a limited-edition portrait of Rajang, which are now available to purchase from their gt shop.

The celebrities names reportedly featured on a stolen spreadsheet of bank and personal details obtained by Tony Muldowney-Colston. The -year-old used his own bespoke device - described as a shrine to crime - to help him defraud hundreds of people out of an estimated pound,. He built the hi-tech machine to con people into thinking he was their banking provider allowing him to mody his voice and play faked bank messages. The device was decorated with holy images and the devout conman is said to have sprinkled holy water on it before calling his victims, according to the Daily Mail.When he was arrested in June this year, Muldowney-Colston told police he created the device with the intention of gaining access to genuine customer accounts and retrieving the available funds. Officers also seized a hard drive containing details of passports and identity cards,  credit cards, and a spreadsheet containing names, addresses, e-mail addresses and phone numbers pertaining to a private members club in London.There is no evidence to suggest that its members were defrauded, but police believe it was a target list.Police believe Muldowney-Colston obtained more than pound, from the accounts he accessed.   Muldowney-Colston, of Clton Street, Brighton, Sussex, was charged with nine counts of possession of an article for use in fraud and two counts of making or supplying an article for use in fraud.He pleaded guilty to the  charges and was jailed for  months at Southwark Crown Court on December . Detectives from the Met Polices cyber crime unit began investigating Muldowney-Colston in January after identying him as a key player in UK-wide cyber crime.The fraudster, who is also known as Tony Colston-Hayter, was previously jailed in  for five-and-a-half years for his role in plundering pound. million from British banks. He led the gang which used a Trojan horse device to hijack computers at branches of Barclays and Santander and siphon off cash. Muldowney-Colston, the son of a university lecturer and solicitor, had gained notoriety in the late s for throwing acid house raves in the Home Counties. He had once been a successful businessman and had been on the Jonathan Ross show. But his le turned and he started to abuse Class A drugs. Detective Inspector Philip McInerney, from the Met Polices cyber crime unit, said: The scam carried out by Muldowney-Colston affected hundreds of people across the UK, and had the potential to affect many more. He is an audacious criminal who only recently was released from prison for carrying out very similar offences. He shows no concern for the welfare of any inidual or organisation, and has made it clear he will use a range of methods to achieve signicant financial gain for himself. I am very grateful to our partners in the banking industry who have worked closely with us on this and a number of investigations. This should send a clear message to anyone considering committing crimes of this nature that we have the tools and methods to identy you and bring you to justice.

Nurse Hannah Reilly had been out in the city with friend Kate Garner on Saturday and used the Uber app to take them home to St Helens. The route to her home is just under  miles and Hannah said she was quoted a fare of around pound before agreeing to the ride, the Liverpool Echo reports. The mum-of-two, who works at the Walton Centre neurological hospital, said: I looked at it and it seemed to be saying it had cost me pound. I was speechless - I didnt believe it. We had to make a stop to drop Kate off, but she lives near me so that shouldnt have changed the fare much. I rang my friend and she was just as shocked as me, she agreed to pay half because the money had already come out of my account. When she looked at the app, Hannah saw how the charges had been added to her journey.   The bill showed a normal fare charge of pound. and a surge . fare of pound.. And the map of the journey appeared to show a route from Liverpool to St Helens - and back to Liverpool again, despite Hannah and Kate getting out in St Helens. Hannah is preparing to challenge Uber over the issue, but said it has already caused her problems. She said: Its just made things harder, like Christmas shopping. The most I have ever paid in a black cab home was pound - so I will be sticking to them or other private hire companies in future - I wont be using Uber again.   An Uber spokesperson said: “Our support team is in touch with Hannah to discuss her experience.” On its website, Uber states: “There are times when so many people are requesting rides that there aren’t enough cars on the road to help take them all. “Bad weather, rush hour, and special events, for instance, may cause unusually large numbers of people to want to ride Uber all at the same time. “In these cases of very high demand, fares may increase to help ensure those who need a ride can get one. This system is called surge pricing, and it lets us continue to be a reliable choice. “Whenever we raise rates due to surge pricing, we let riders know in the app. Some riders will choose to pay, while some will choose to wait a few minutes to seethe rates go back down to normal.” "},{"url":null,"title":"public pianos tune desire bring","story":"NewsopinionHeartwarming street piano stories bringing people together at ChristmasProfessional and amateur musicians have told how Britains city pianos have changed their lives for the betterShareCommentsByRos Wynne JonesReal Britain columnist:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsopinionThe John Lewis Christmas ad with Sir Elton John has drawn attention to a heartwarming phenomenon \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLong before this year’s John Lewis Christmas advert, Elton John gave strangers the gt of a piano. After playing a few bars of his hit Tiny Dancer for stunned commuters at London’s St Pancras station, he left the piano behind with a note. “My gt is my song,” the message said, “and this piano’s for you.” Donated in , Elton’s piano wasn’t the first at St Pancras. The oldest one on the concourse is brightly painted and was donated in . It comes with an instruction “Play me. I’m Yours”. One of over , upright pianos rescued from landfill to appear in public places in  cities all over the world – from New York to San Jose and Paris to London – it was saved as part of a project started by British artist Luke Jerram.  At St Pancras station one of the regular players of the piano is a man who has “homeless ups and downs” and who calls himself Michael Piano Man. He says simply: “The piano keeps me alive.” When he first saw the piano at St Pancras he says: “It was like I’d walked into the Garden of Eden. Everyone has their bad days and you need something to help those bad days. It’s therapy. “I don’t see doctors. When I go to the piano, I find all the medicine that I need. I help myself – the piano heals me.” The piano, he says, “strokes your heart, it mellows you”. Jerram launched the project as an ongoing artwork in  and shyestimates its pianos have been listened to by more than  million people worldwide. But it was never just about rescuing pianos. The first instrument he placed was at a laundrette, a space where he noticed no one spoke to each other. Now they are in stations, parks and shopping centres.  This year, the Together television channel and the Campaign to End Loneliness, want Christmas to be all about public pianos bringing people together for a festive sing-song, whether its carols, or Fairytale of New York. When people live in smaller and smaller spaces, music is being cut at schools because of vicious budget cuts, and pianos have gone from pubs, public pianos have never been more important. Meanwhile, for someone like Michael they are a leline. In a film by Maureen Ni Fiann to be shown on Together channel tomorrow and on Christmas Day, teenager Jamie Manahan says she copes with depression by playing the street piano in the underpass by Herne Hill station in South London.  “Music is my heartbeat,” she says. “I wouldn’t be surprisedmy heart was shaped like a treble clef.” Chas Hodges, one half of Chas  Dave, also gave one of the last performances before he died on a street piano. The Herne Hill piano even led to an audition for The Voice for Mina Hernandez David, who drives a bin lorry. “Singer Jessie Ware filmed me on her phone and I got invited for an audition after it went viral,” she says. Producers traced her via the yellow refuse collector’s vest she was wearing. Famous musicians often stop to play the pianos too. Alicia Keys played a street piano in New York, and Jamie Cullum stopped to play the one at the Sacre Coeur in Paris. “Pianos are a way of connecting people,” Jools Holland says. “The piano is not just the friend in the living room. It can be the friend in the station.”  Self-taught concert pianist James Rhodes says: “It’s the one thing that has never let me down. “Music is always there. It always does the job. It’s not something digital, it’s made of copper and wood and strings. At one time this country had more pianos than bathtubs. One in every pub.” From Rocketman to Piano Man, this Christmas is all about pianos. As I write, a battered but beautul piano a friend saw being shyadvertised free to a good home on Facebook is arriving at my home. A free gt from one family to another. But street pianos are a free gt for everyone – musicians with no space to have a piano, pianists with no home or far from home, passers-by, and people facing a blue Christmas alone. “One time a girl came up to me crying, and she sat down with me,” Michael Piano Man says. “I played her a Bach piece and she took it in and in no time the tears had gone. It’s amazing to think what the piano can do. It strokes your heart, it mellows you.” "},{"url":null,"title":"schoolboy who looked perfectly healthy","story":"NewsSchoolboy, , who looked perfectly healthy told this Christmas will be his lastReece Probert, , was told a fortnight ago that he had six months to live after a brain scan revealed an aggressive brain tumourShareCommentsByJames Rodger:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsJenna Probert with her son, Reece, in hospital \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn -year-old boy will have the best Christmas ever after his devastated family were told it will be his last. Just two weeks ago Reece Probert was told he had six months to live when doctors found he was suffering from an inoperable brain tumour. Reece seemed perfectly healthy just last month, but his mum Jenna, , took him to the doctors when he suddenly developed a limp and then a slur, reports BirminghamLive. Scans revealed that the schoolboy had a rare aggressive brain tumour with a prognosis of between six to  months after diagnosis. His devastated family are rallying around to give him the best Christmas ever. Jenna from Wombourne, south Staffordshire, said: It will be our last Christmas together and we want to make sure its nice and comfortable and cosy for Reece.   I want to make him feel like a king. He should feel like the most important person in the world. It will be emotional because it will be his last Christmas. We will decorate the whole house and make it look like Santas grotto. It will be the most memorable Christmas ever. Reece knows he has cancer but doesnt know the reality of it. I cant face telling him. I just need him to be happy. Christmas will be a family day and we will give him anything he wants. We will just cherish it together as a family.   Just six weeks ago Reece was fit and healthy, but after ing from a trip to see his grandparents in Northern Ireland in November his mum noticed unusual symptoms. He had a limp and a sore hand, so his GP sent him to AE for an x-ray, and for tests on his tendons. But Jenna really began to worry when Reece began to slur his words two weeks ago. A neighbour - who had been diagnosed a benign brain tumour - noticed Reece struggling to speak and feared the worst, having suffered similar symptoms in the past. Personal trainer Jenna phoned  and was advised to take Reece to the Russells Hall Hospital, in Dudley, where doctors initially thought he had suffered a stroke.   But on December , when doctors at Birmingham Childrens Hospital performed a CT scan and found an abnormality the the brain. Two days later Jenna was told her son had dfuse intrinsic pontine glioma - an aggressive cancer typically found in children. She said: I collapsed when I was told that. I felt like my heart had been ripped out. It was a horrible feeling. They put him on steroids to reduce the swelling before he had the MRI scan.   It was bad enough being told he had a stroke. I was just praying that they had got it all wrong. I just started screaming no, no, no. I couldnt breathe. Its the worst thing any mum can be told. Even the oncologist has tears in her eyes whilst she was telling me. We were taken into the family room and told that chemotherapy wont work and radiotherapy will only shrink the tumour. But it will come back and will eventually end his le. Most children die between six and  months from diagnosis.   Reece is due to start his first round of radiotherapy to reduce the size of the tumour and give him more time. Jenna is now focused on making sure Reece has the most amazing Christmas with her, partner Robert Perry, , and his sister Trinity Alcock, six. Tearful Jenna said: Ive had to put the reality of it to the back of my mind. Im just focused on enjoying him whilst we still have him. We want to make memories with him and just want to make sure he is happy and comfortable.   Reece has been fantastic. He has taken it all in his stride and has been amazing. I couldnt be more proud of him. He is known as the class clown and his friends have been to visit him. For us the next year is all about making him feel extra special. Friends and family have launched fundraising campaigns and arranged charity events in a bid to raise money to ensure Reece has a Christmas to remember. So far pound, has been raised on GoFundMe.

Angela Mason has accused Camelot of cheating her out of her winnings. The -year-old purchased a Pharaohs Fortune card last month, reports The Sun, the same one which Eric Walker has been accused of manipulating. The gran, from Willenhall in the West Midlands, has a pound flutter every day and could not sleep the night she got what she thought was the winning ticket - which she planned to use to pay off her mortgage, according to the newspaper. But Angela had her dreams of a mortgage-free future dashed when she rushed to her local Post Office and was told the win could not be veried.   Florist Angela said: “At the Post Office they put in the code over and over again, but it wasn’t working. “Everyone I had showed it to said it was a winner, but I emailed Camelot and five days later they replied and said I hadnt scratchedoff properly. She claimsshe had scratched the card anymore it would have been wrecked. Camelot reportedly told the -year-old that one of her ‘winning’ grid codes was an E and not the F that she had scratched – meaning the three symbols she revealed did not match up. The revelation comes just days after it emerged that dad-of-four Mr Walker was also denied a poundk payout on his card. But he was accused of doctoring the letter F to look like an E.   He has invited the police to have a look at the ticket and says he is the one being cheated. He explained how his partner Amanda Emmadi, , scratched the card off to reveal three winning pharoahs. She was staring at the ticket for two hours, she was traumatised because she couldnt believe what was happening in front of her, he said.  I had to pull the card out of her hand and then saw the same thing and she was seeing. Its a winner. Angela believes Camelot is refusing to pay out because it wants to avoid coughing up millionsthere is a widespread fault with the cards.   The mum-of-two said: “I told‘you’ve got a faulty batch and you know it and are trying not to pay out’. “It makes me feel angry because they’re denying me a legit pay-out.” The game offers five top prizes of pound, by giving sixteen co-ordinates which are used to scratch off squares on a grid in the hope of matching three pharaoh symbols. Camelot insists the winning ticket has not yet been claimed and denied claims of a faulty batch. A spokesman said: We do not believe this to be a faulty batch as Ms Mason claims. We will reconstruct the card in our system, just as we did in Mr Walkers case, to determine whether it is a genuine winning ticket. If webelieve that somebody has intentionally attempted to defraud The National Lottery,then, just like any other company, we reserve the right to take whatever action we consider is appropriate – which includes reporting the matter to the police.” "},{"url":null,"title":"unseen portrait meghan markle prince","story":"NewsUnseen portrait of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry spotted by fans now emergesA secret snap of Harry and Meghan has emerged, thanks to a Photoshop geniusShareCommentsByRobyn DarbyshireAudience Writer:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsA new portrait has emerged \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailEveryone knows that the royals love a good portrait, theyre good for posterity.Eagle-eyed fans previously noticed one of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, in pride of place in none other than the Queens room earlier this year - and its now emerged.

John Drennan went down on one knee in Central Park to ask longterm partner Daniella Anthony to marry him. But as they walked through Times Square the engagement ring - which was a little too big - slipped off her finger and tumbled through a subway grate. The scene was caught on CCTV, sparking a hunt for the mystery couple after the ring was rescued by NYPD officers. Police announced on Sunday that they managed to identy and locate the pair, but by then John and Daniella had already flown back to the UK.

Appearing on the show, John, , explained how the pair were walking back from a show when he took Daniellas hand and unintentionally knocked it off. Ellen, to the laughter of the studio audience, said: So you did it  You knocked it off!  John jokingly agreed, adding that beforehand he had actually convinced Daniella to wear the ring out - despite her fearing it was too big for her finger.

And in a perfect ending to this fairytale story, John got back down on one knee to propose to Daniella, , for the second time. An emotional Daniella sobbed yes much to the delight of the audience.  John tweeted: I actually proposed in central park and it fell off as walking... Spent ages trying to find and police stopped me from physically climbing down the drain! So so happy to have ring back! God bless America! He added: I cant believe its been found - We are so so happy!! Thank you @NYPDnews. Incredible! Thought was lost forever!

draw with Morton and admits they need to do more to rediscover their best form and top the table.The Slovakian striker has been praised this season for his contribution both on and off the ball – he has netted seven times in all competitions and covers plenty ground for his side – however, he feels he and his team-mates need to do more to get results than just play nice football.Freddy Frans’ headed opener after  minutes wasn’t enough at Cappielow at the weekend as Gregor Buchanan nodded home an equaliser into an empty with  minutes to go and, although upset he couldn’t add to his tally of goals to get the three points for the Terrors, Safranko knows the whole team needs to work harder and show their true qualities and grind out results.“We can do better, we have to do better,” he said.“I think we always look to ourselves but our performance must be better.“Even when we concede a goal we still have all this quality and power in our team to go up but we just have to take a long, hard look in the mirror now and work hard and we will be back.“Morton tried and they worked hard, but like I said, we have the quality to be successful in the game but I can say that we are really disappointed.”The -year-old has been happy to make a good start to le at Tannadice, scoring goals and becoming a fans’ favourite but also concedes the whole squad is hurting after failing to close the gap more on leaders Ayr United at the top of the Championship.Dropping two points in Greenock, after Ross County drew with Queen of the South and Ayr saw their clash with Inverness postponed, feels like a loss and a chance missed for the Tangerines but Safranko insists their ambitions are unwavering as they prepare for a trip to face Caley Thistle in the Highlands on Saturday.“It’s not a step back in our ambitions to win the league but we have to be careful and be ready for every game,” he added.“We can’t find any excuses going up to Inverness or at Morton, we have to just go there and put our % in.“Everyone has to show their best and, hopefully, after that we can win.“I have enjoyed my time here playing and scoring goals but, like the rest of the team, I want to be better for every game, that’s all I can say.”United boss Robbie Neilson echoed his star striker’s sentiments, expressing his anger at his side not being able to break down Morton nor hold onto their lead and see the result out.He said: “We got the goal and probably could’ve got more but in the second half we got caught up in the direct game.“They went direct into the striker and played off of that but we lacked the composure to bring the ball down and pass it that got us the success in the first half.“We could have won it with some chances late on but it should have been put to bed by then“We shouldn’t need to do that at the end and we should’ve killed the game earlier but also we should be able to hold onto a - lead.“We know playing against Morton they’ve got good delivery with Michael Tidser and have got big centre-halves that can come up so we know we shouldn’t be giving free-kicks away round about the box.“We gave away a schoolboy free-kick, Chris Millar’s out on the touchline with nowhere to go and two guys roundabout him but we steamroller into the back of him.”"},{"url":null,"title":"shoppers see man taken out of dundee store in handcuffs after alleged incident","story":"A man has been charged following a disturbance at a convenience store in Mid Craigie.Police were called to the Happyhillock Shopping Centre in Happyhillock Road.A worker contacted authorities claiming a man had been shouting, swearing and making threats inside the shop.Several customers and staff were said to be inside the store at the time of the incident.Witnesses reported seeing a man being taken out of the shop soon after and placed in handcuffs.A police spokeswoman said: “Police were called to Happyhillock Road shortly after am yesterday.“A -year-old man was arrested for threatening and abusive behaviour and for resisting arrest.”A force spokesman said a man has since been charged in relation to the incident and was due to appear at Dundee Sherf Court yesterday."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c0fb4708a077.jpg ","title":"tom duthie lets hope christmas hasnt come early for dundee united","story":"Has Christmas come early for Dundee United fans  For once the answer to that question is they definitely hope not.For most of us getting to unwrap a package in advance of the th of this month is a happy bonus butthe festive season has arrived early for Arabs this year, they won’t be happy.That’s because last year, Christmas brought the first strong indication things under then new boss Csaba Laszlo were not going to work out.Dismissing what was a largely irrelevant Irn-Bru Cup defeat against Crusaders, technically his first game in charge, an impressive start that had produced four wins and a draw was brought to a shuddering halt with a late December defeat against leaders and eventual champions St Mirren.It was a reversal from which the Tangerines, and ultimately the gaffer, never really recovered.From having the chance to hit the top of the table as they travelled to Paisley that night, within weeks, any chance of automatic promotion was effectively gone.January this year brought a humiliating - defeat away to a Falkirk side who were struggling near the bottom of the Championship and the month ended with an almost equally painful home loss to Morton.Coming as they did in the weeks following the Buddies clash, those were defeats that pretty much confirmed United were not getting back to the Premiership at the end of the season.Now, under another new managerial appointment in Robbie Neilson, the team could be in danger of following a similar path to last term, albeit it a few weeks earlier.Five wins and a draw into his reign, the other week saw a wake-up call like the one his predecessor received when leaders Ayr United came to Tannadice and dealt out a - thrashing.That was alarming and the bells had barely stopped ringing before there was more concern as Robbie’s team squandered a lead at Morton last Saturday and had to settle for a draw. Festive flippancy aside, there is, of course, reason to believe the slide in results presided over by Csaba will not be repeated this time round.Under the new boss, the Tangerines have looked better organised and with a clearer game plan than they’ve probably had since the early days of Jackie McNamara’s time in charge, or certainly since Ray McKinnon’s first term in charge.Their style under this gaffer, by no means just blood and thunder, is more robust and therefore better suited to the physical rigours of Scotland’s second tier.On top of that, and in part it should be said because of Csaba’s ability to identy decent talent, there can be little argument this season’s squad contains better overall quality.In striker Pavol Safranko they have a front man of the calibre many teams even at top-flight level must be anxious off.And wide man Fraser Aird has been another astute signing who, like Safranko, has really come into his own under the current boss.There is also reason to believe his past, successful, experience of Championship football when he raced to promotion at Hearts means that come next month’s transfer window, Robbie will get exactly what he needs to strengthen the weaker areas of his team.The impressive form of Ayr United does remain a worry and, as they showed at Tannadice the week before last, they have to be regarded as serious promotion contenders.Ross County and this weekend’s opponents Inverness also remain challengers.And another disappointment against them could have fans worried about that early Christmas gt."},{"url":null,"title":"we are the team no one wants to play says dundees gensy kusunga","story":"Gensy Kusunga says Dundee used to be the team everybody wanted to play – now they are the team nobody wants to face he’s urged his team-mates to keep their focus.The impressive defensive display which earned the Dark Blues a - draw at home to Rangers, despite being reduced to  men after just  minutes, lted the side off the foot of the Premiership table for the first time since August.And that was in no small part down to the solid defensive display from Angolan international Kusunga, alongside centre-back partner Andy Boyle.Between them, they repelled everything Rangers threw into the box to keep up their unbeaten run, which now stretches to four matches.And the confidence which is oozing through the team now, allied to that dogged defensive display, will mean nobody will fancy facing Dundee in the coming weeks, evenit is Kilmarnock, Aberdeen and Celtic away next.Kusunga said: “I hope that is the case!“It’s good to hear that other teams won’t want to play us.“Before everyone wanted to play us to take confidence! Now it has turned around but we need to continue.“It’s good to have confidence – but not too much!“We have to still work, work, work and not feel we are there because we drew and won one game.“We have to stay focused and, hopefully, we can get some good results before the break.”The former Basel defender is delighted the club’s form has turned around but has urged the Dark Blues not to relax as they bid to continue their resurgence in the busiest time of the season.After three matches on the road in seven days, Dundee will welcome Livingston to Dens Park on Boxing Day before St Johnstone make the short trip from Perth on December .Despite moving off the bottom of the Premiership table, Kusunga knows the work has only just begun and wants the “belief” that has surged through the team to continue.He added: “We are happy because we had to work hard for the draw with  men against Rangers.“It was a good game, a massive game for us and to take points was the most important thing.“We are happy but we need to stay focused.“The road is a long one and we need keep our focus for the next game and the many games in December where we need to get points.“We showed a lot of belief on Sunday,  against  for so long and never put our heads down. We stayed strong, stayed together and everybody worked, worked, worked – when you do that you can get results, that’s the key.“It was important for the confidence to keep our run going but we can’t relax, the way is long and we have to take things game after game and do the maximum we can.”The dference in Dundee’s displays over the past few weeks and the rest of the campaign is a marked one with the side trebling their points total in the last four matches.And Kusunga says taking responsibility as a team rather than pointing to inidual errors has been a massive factor.He said: “Everybody is taking responsibility. Before we could always say we didn’t win because of one mistake, you need to take responsibility and work like men.”And he’s urged the Dark Blues to repeat their show against Rangers in the coming weeks.He added: “Every game is hard, the opponents are strong in every game and we can’t think about playing a small team or playing a big team.“Every match is dficult and we need to work hard the same against whoever we play.”"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas -

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"luke naisby named red stars new manager","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAccomplished defender Luke Naisby is Lochgilphead Red Star AFC#s new manager.The new manager#s first challenge was to take charge of Red Star against Ferguslie Star AFC on Saturday November  in Paisley.The Red Star Facebook page said: #The committee is delighted to welcome him to his new role with the club.

Ferguslie were much more clinical and added a further two goals to give themselves a comfortable - lead at the break.Into the second half and despite some better passages of play the match was killed as a contest when Luke Kalache was ordered off for handling the ball outside the area. Young Jake Weir took his spot in goal with young McGeachy making way as the visitors were reduced to ten men. From the resulting free kick, Fergulie’s Andy Turner found the bottom corner to make it -.The home side added a fth before the ten men responded with Ryan Caskie converting a Colin Weir corner to make it -.Star were caught out again late on as Ferguslie added another two goals to make the scoreline a harsh looking - at full time.This was a stern lesson for Star, although the performance of young Neily Russell, who came on late on and looked composed up front, will give Naisby optimism.On Saturday December , Red Star are at home where another tough test against Hillington awaits.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta. This was a fitting finish to the Championship at Leuchars with very fast stages and a good test of manand machine in equal measures.Photographs by West Coast Photos."},{"url":null,"title":"speedy kirsty points the way ahead for dad","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAt the age of , Kirsty Mochrie made her first outing as navigator for Innes Mochrie at the  Kingdom Stages rally.Seasoned campaigner Innes, who happens to be Kirsty#s dad, was well guided around the course in their Kilmory Coachworks .Kirsty#s gran Libby told the Advertiser: #She just loved it.

Clear it up as it happens or do something in the development plan to make sure it doesn’t in the future.Name and address supplied.What do you think about Lochgilphead and its future  Contact the Advertiser on editor@argyllshireadvertiser or message us directly via Facebook. Alternatively write to: Argyllshire Advertiser,  Argyll Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, PA NBSir,As reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Christmas came early for local causes in Argyll recently when the Co-op revealed a £, festive funding boost.The money was shared by three organisations, all of whom are making a real dference to communities throughout the region. These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowMid Argyll Flower Club members welcomed Sandra Robertson from Dumfries to their annual open evening on Monday December .A packed house watched with interest as Sandra created amazing Christmas-themed displays.Lucky raffle winners left with beautul arrangements that, with care and attention, could see them through Christmas.Sandra, who won Best in Show  at Gardening Scotland with a James Bond inspired arrangement, was an excellent demonstrator and told many humorous stories of her #flower le# to an enthralled and appreciative audience."},{"url":null,"title":"coffee to support baby unit","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAn Ardrishaig woman plans to throw herself into the icy sea on New Year#s Day.Joan Williamson is taking part in the Loony Dook at South Queensferry to raise money for the Simpsons Special Care Babies unit in Edinburgh, which looked after Joan and her twin daughters Angel and Star when they were born prematurely.

That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

I think we need the ability to fine someone a lot more than just £ for causing damage to property, which is a sheep.#A -week consultation on the proposed Bill will go out electronically in early January .Ms Harper explained: #We can then start the process of developing a Bill at stage one which will be discussed in the Scottish Parliament before stage two in front of the rural committee, and then stage three, so hopefully we#ll be able to get this process moved forward before the end of the parliamentary session.#Brian Walker said: #I think an awful lot of positives should have come out from this meeting. There was someone here from pretty much every organisation that is involved with livestock worrying.#The way things are nowadays the term #worrying# doesn#t make people sit up and think.#The word #attack# will hopefully become part of the legislation. It#s the shock and horror of dealing with the animals left alive, we need to get that across. It#s very traumatic.#Then there is the financial cost. The sheep killed in the March attack were breeding ewe hoggs.#Brian Walker continued: #They were going to be on the farm for the next five or six years and during that time they would have produced offspring for me to sell which is what creates our income.#He stressed that . per cent of dog walkers are fine, adding: #Most of my land is round about the town of Inveraray and I meet a lot of dog walkers. I know a lot of them and there#s no problem.#It#s a minority of people who allow their dogs to run out of control who cause problems. But it#s becoming a bigger minority as more and more people get pet dogs.#It#s a problem that#s escalating and, one way or another, there have to be proper controls put in place.#"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

He told the Ayrshire Post: I respect the right of those who have called the Prime Minister into question - but I dont think they are right to do so.

A positive inspection report from Education Scotland found consistently “good” performance across the board at Stration Primary School and Eary Years Centre. The inspectors came to their conclusions after a recent visit to the school that included discussions with parents, children and staff. The inspection team found the following strengths in the school’s work: • Headteacher Liz Candlish leads the strong staff team to achieve the best quality educational experiences in a learning environment which is nurturing and encouraging. • The motivated children who are engaged in their learning. Their exemplary behaviour is respectful and caring of adults and each other. • The strong links and involvement with members of the community. They feel valued by staff and enhance children’s outdoor experiences and enterprise activities. The following areas for improvement were identied: • The school should take steps to increase the pace and progression of children’s learning to raise attainment. • Assessment data collected from a range of sources should now be acted on more consistently to ensure maximum impact on the attainment of a few learners. • A structured approach to develop more independent learners, who can talk about their learning and be clear about their next steps. Councillor William Grant said: “I’m pleased to see such a positive report for Straiton, with staff delivering high quality learning for all children, something that should come as welcome news to families. “Headteacher, Liz Candlish, was singled out for providing strong leadership, with the school thriving and providing a nurturing environment that is inspiring children to embrace learning and to care for each other. “I would like to thank everyone involved for working hard to maintain the high standards at Straiton.” Inspectors are confident that the school has the capacity to continue to improve and so they will make no more visits in connection with this inspection.

In fact shersquos really quite unique in that shersquos furry, has four legs, a tail, and is the schoolrsquos very own puppy.So how did this adorable pooch make its way into the lives and hearts of the pupils and staff at Priorsford  Did the pupils ask for a puppy on their Christmas list this year I discovered that Peggy was actually on the wish list of teacher Caroline Sharpe, who approached headteacher Sandra Macgregor a year ago with the idea of a therapy dog for the school.Caroline explained: ldquoWe heard about therapy dogs and the benefits they bring to pupils, we wanted to tie it into our health and wellbeing in the school.ldquoI attended the SSPCA conference and there were people there from universities who had taken therapy dogs into final exams for students.ldquoEvidence shows that therapy dogs lower peoplersquos heart rate, gives a general sense of well-being and improves childrenrsquos socialisation skills. We visited a school in Midlothian who had a Cockapoo puppy and we knew we could make it work for us. She has changed the dynamic of the school.Peggy will live with Caroline, but will be in school full-time.Having settled into her new home at Priorsford Primary this week, Peggy is already the most popular pupil in school.Despite skipping five primary year-groups to join the P class, Peggy is at the very start of her journey to becoming a certied school dog.ldquoShe has settled in well and has already met the pupils at assemblies. My daughter is a vet and told me to expose her to everything straight away. The time between eight and  weeks is really important for stamping the personality and the secureness of the puppy, added Caroline.Peggy is learning how to become a listening dog, who will help children read aloud more confidently. She will put her head in their lap and listen without judgement, prompting them to turn a page with her paw.Caroline explained: ldquoNot only will she improve the pupilrsquos literacy skills, Peggy will be there for any children who are feeling anxious or worried, they can take some time out to talk to her.I joined the P class in the library as they read the tale of Greyfriars Bobby to Peggy. But she was worn out after a busy morning and childrenrsquos soothing reading put her to sleep!As I wander through the school with Peggy, pupils eyes widen at the sight of the furry bundle and instantly a smile lights up their faces. ldquoI love her Mrs Sharp, she is soooo cute, cooed one girl.When it came to naming the puppy, it was decided not to ask the children, who, Caroline said, would have come up with wonderfully unique suggestions.Before leaving the school, I am given Peggy to cuddle, and for a split second I consider slipping her into my handbag and making a run for it. But a vision of an angry mob in blue chasing me through the playground fills me with fear and I decide she is exactly where she should be.It is said that dog is a manrsquos best friend.

That science has or will find solutions to all our manmade problems. The issue with this approach has always been that, experiments carried out in controlled environments like laboratories and then replicated in nature have always been unexpected and sometimes catastrophic.These scientic methods involved limited assessments and tests and mainly conducted for profit by big pharma!Having covered Making Scotland GMOFree in my previous column I will focus on our next vision, which is to make Scotland a  per cent organic country.The green revolution introduced in the s, sprayed fertilisers and pesticides on farm land all over the planet to increase crop yields. This in turn led to many forests being cut down to grow what was then called lsquocash cropsrsquo and small-scale farming was replaced by industrial farming on a massive scale supported by government subsidies.Big corporations acquired land across the globe, food was added as a commodity to be traded for profits on the stock market and this in turn has led to inequalities in health and access to food especially in developing and third world countries.The unforeseen impact of chemicals for growing over the last few decades, has led to the fall of nutrients in the soil, as this was being depleted by over use and irregular crop rotation. Profits were maximised and are even today. For example, soya beans are now grown in many countries as cattle feed for the West! This then leaves no arable land for the local population to grow food leading to widespread hunger and impoverished conditions.We need to go back to our roots and grow food at local levels on a small scale and bring back farming as a lucrative job for people to invest their time and energies. This will be a sustainable long-term approach and remove the need for farming subsidies that are the biggest scandal of our times as most go to big landowners in this country. Can you imagine governments are currently paying farmers in some cases not to grow Organic farming will not only bring back the health of the soil but also stop corporations making money through selling chemicals and hybrid seeds. This will have a positive impact on the lives of all people as lsquoorganic produce will no longer be the domain of the rich and middle class who can afford to feed themselves and their children with good food. This choice should be available to all.So! Whatrsquos happening globally where organic farming is concerned  Denmark is on its way to becoming the worldrsquos first  per cent organic country, followed by Bhutan and Estonia. India has the North-eastern state of Sikkim designated as the first fully organic state anywhere in the world and was awarded the UN lsquoOscar for the Best Policy that is inclusive and comprehensive of all socioeconomic aspects.Can Scotland be  per cent organic  Yes! It can."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-factory-announces-50-redundancies","story":"ONE of the regions major manufacturers has announced that it is looking to pay off more than  members of staff.Jedburgh-based Mainetti UK is looking for voluntary redundancies following a second year of reported losses.Bosses at the Oxnam Road coat-hanger manufacturer are blaming recycling and a reduction in high street retailers as well as an increase in the minimum wage for combined losses over the past  months of more than pound million.Mainettis Regional MD Jim Hutchison stated: \"The last two years have been dficult for the business.\"In  Mainetti UK Limited made a loss of pound, and this year we are forecast to lose a further pound,.\"The business is faced with an ever increasing cost base with increases in the National Minimum Wage, higher electricity costs and higher business rates.\"To add to these cost pressures the business is seeing local UK demand for hangers reducing.\"Many retailers are closing down shops or reducing their selling space and this means there are less hangers required.\"In addition, an increased emphasis on recycling means more hangers are being ed from stores for resorting, which further reduces manufacturing demand.\"Mainetti UK currently employs around  staff.Talks have already started with unions over the planned  redundancies.Mr Hutchison added: \"These changes will only impact the Jedburgh hanger manufacturing unit.\"All other products made in Jedburgh ndash flower buckets, polythene bags, Glastic and The Seatcase will not be impacted and in fact the company will continue to invest in all these areas during , in order to grow those parts of our Jedburgh manufacturing business.\"Local MP John Lamont has been in talks with the company over the past few days.He told us: ldquoThis is disappointing news from a long standing employer in Jedburgh.ldquoClearly their market is changing and Mainetti are having to adapt to that.

their Burnham on Sea microwave joke was worth the admission fee alone.These four crazy characters swayed towards slapstick, flirted with farce and brought down the house with a bombardment of belly-laughs.Despite all the fun and frivolity, though, Sleeping Beauty was still a sensational piece of stage theatre.Julia Noble and Steve Hartley-Oliver were authoritative and appealing as Queen Marigold and King Cactus.And the regular arrival of sinister Witch Hazel, played by both Tracey Borthwick and Julie Smith, in a cloud of customary green smoke made sure the young audience were kept on their toes.The couplet duels between the villainous Witch and Fairy Lilac, played exquisitely by Amanda Blacklock, were both clever and entertaining.Couplets aside, music was at the heart of Sleeping Beauty, from the opening Lazy Hazy Crazy Days of Summer all the way through the seasonal finale, and many of the most memorable numbers came from Fairy Lilac and her supporting coloured fairies of Shannon Mack, Ruby Everett, Caitlin Green and Katie Wilson.From You Can Do Magic and Dream a Little Dream of Me to the luscious Hushabye Mountain, Amanda and her young apprentices were wonderful.A beautul rendition of Born with a Smile on My Face was the highlight of Aimee Richardsons all-to-short appearance as Young Rose.And the childrens fun-filled version of Wake Up You Sleepy Head was also among the many highlights of a fantastic night of musical theatre.The songs came thick and fast - as did the jokes.Hawick, Melrose and Tweedbank were ridiculed regularly, as were Theresa May, the Ladhope Vale one-way system and the residents of Abbotsford Court.The laughs were loud and the cheers, especially when Braw Lad and Braw Lass Greg Kelly and Kimberley OMay turned up for Roses Christening, were even louder.The choreography was both imaginative and eye-catching with dancers Emma Wilson, Jess Thomson, Rachel Falconer and Sara Facchini having obviously put in the rehearsal hours.The score was foot-tappingly good, the scene changes were swt and the stage was picture perfect.But ultimately its the actors, dancers and singers who take a production to new heights.And when the cast is enjoying themselves as much as the audience, the people behind the Right Angle Theatre Company can go to sleep this Christmas with a smile on their faces.CASTFairy Lilac: Amanda BlacklockWitch Hazel: Julie Smith Tracey BorthwickMuddles: Billy RooneyKing Cactus: Steve Hartley-OliverQueen Marigold: Julia NobleNurse Hettie Harpic: Jodie MillarFetch: Antony WilsonCarrie: Katie GordonFairy Red: Shannon MackFairy Yellow: Ruby EverettFairy Green: Caitlin GreenFairy Blue: Katie WilsonYoung Rose: Aimee RichardsonPrince Alexis: Stuart MitchellRose: Amy ThomsonDancers: Sara Facchini, Rachel falconer, Jess Thomson and Emma Wilson.Chorus: Ruaridh Anderson, Charli Black, Tracy Borthwick, Callum Crooks, Erin Gallagher, Nicole Hughes, Mya Lamb, Molly McFarlane, Lee-Anne Robinson, Millie Robinson, Ally Turnbull, Eilidh Walker.Children : Abigail Burns, Ellie Cockburn, Grace Decoteau, Rhianna Devlin, Faith Heriot, Fraser Scott Hermiston, Chloe Noble, Ceijay Robinson, Rebecca Scott, Max Turnbull and Ellie Welsh.: Simona Andom, Sophia Blaen, Georgie Everett, Skye Machara Henderson, Sky Hume, Chloe Johnston, Emily Johnstone, Lucy Johnstone, Ellie mcLaren, Molly McLaren, Carrie Smith and Isla Train.PRODUCTIONStage Crew: Billy Easson, Steven Headspeath, Craig Monks, Adam Nichol and Malcolm Wilson.Prompter: Sheila WilsonMake Up  Hair: Team from Millars Hair SalonMake Up Co-ordinator: Yvonne KeddieProps: Gordon Keddie and Sarah PhilipsChildrens Co-ordinator: Amanda BlacklockChildrens Organizer: Michelle DevlinPhotographs: Jade PringleGroup Bookings: Morag KeddieRaffle: Susan FalconerScenery: Border StudiosFront of House: Lana ThomsonKeyboards: Chris AchenbachPercussion: Graham Borthwick"},{"url":null,"title":"new-housing-estate-for-lauder-given-go-ahead","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has given the go-ahead to a brand new housing estate in Lauder.Members of the councilrsquos planning and building standards body voted unanimously to approve an application from Persimmon Homes to build  new homes just north of Thirlestane Drive.Seven people have objected to the development, with a further four expressing concerns, including Kimberly Shaw-Walker, of Thirlestane Drive.She wrote: ldquoThe site is not suitable for the volume of houses proposed.

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets. On the hillside, , stark white tombstones bring home the enormity of what was done over only a few days a mere  years or so ago.More than , died at Srebrenica , perished in Sarajevo , women suffered rape as an act of war millions fled their homes, some even finding their way to the refugee reception centre at Cheylesmore Lodge in North Berwick.All the survivors I met asked the same question: why did so much suffering have to happen before the international community acted to stop it  In telling us their story, they relived their own pain. They did so in the hope that we learn the lessons of Bosnia. We need only look at Syria or Yemen to know that we have not.That is why we must remember Srebrenica.If any local groups would like to hear more about the work of Remembering Srebrenica, please contact my office on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"the-best-fortnite-gifts-for-christmas-2018","story":"Fortnite is the most popular video game of the year and has taken over not just everyonersquos console, but Christmas lists up and down the country too.If you have family members, big or small, who are mad for Fortnite but find yourself utterly clueless as to what itrsquos all about or what to get someone who loves it for Christmas, we can help out with this guide to everything Fortnite from the game itself to presents you should buy this year.*On some occasions, we earn revenue from content.

This turned out to be an astonishing discovery.\"Irsquom sure other gems like this are waiting to be discovered in the burgh records which are an incredibly rich resource for historians and fully deserve their UNESCO designation as nationally important documentary heritage.The entry in which the ship is mentioned as having crossed the Atlantic relates primarily to debts incurred by Patrick Donaldson, a burgess of the town, and his fellow burgess William Findlay, the master and skipper of the ldquoWilliam.The records reveal that both Patrick and William were involved in the fitting-out and freighting of the vessel between it leaving Aberdeen in July , and itsin .The other partners and owners in the Newfoundland venture are given as Archibald Smith and burgess Alexander Kempt, while a Colin Campbell is noted as being on board the vessel, as was a carpenter by the name of John.Artists impression of The Gt of God, previously thought to be the first Scottish ship to cross the Atlantic to the New World. Pic: WikicommonsIn , when the ldquoWilliam made her long westward voyage, Scottish interests in North America were still very much in their infancy. The tentative trading contacts of the ship would have been making helped develop the settlements which became home to many in the Scottish diaspora during the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.Phil Astley, City Archivist, said: ldquoQuirky and unusual stories quite often come to light when reading through original records ndash itrsquos part of the fun of working in an archive, however, itrsquos rare to have a find as historically signicant as that made by Thomas.\"It is even more remarkable that we know the names of several crew members.The precise nature of the cargo on the outward voyage is not known although from later entries in the same volume it becomes clear that the ldquoWilliam ed to Aberdeen from North America via the port of Aveiro in Portugal where it picked up a cargo of salt, most probably destined to be used for preserving fish and meat.Remarkably, several of the Portugal to Aberdeen crew are also named: John Barclay, Alexander Currie, David Morton, David Easton, William Brown, Robert Fleming, Paul Fraser, William Young, and John Dow.It is possible that some may have been crew members on the Newfoundland voyage. They had paid money to Patrick Donaldson, one of the owners and the shiprsquos clerk, to buy their share of the shiprsquos cargo of salt.On arrival in Aberdeen the owners refused to pay the crew their whole share as the cargo was spoiled due to a leak in the shiprsquos hold. The dispute then came before the Burgh Court and was recorded in the Council Register.After the, the ships fate and that of its crew become obscure once more as it drops out of the record.Aberdeen remains a busy port todayLord Provost of Aberdeen, Barney Crockett, said the discovery cemented the citys place in Scotlands maritime history.He said: ldquoAberdeen is a proud maritime city, and this is a hugely important historical find. It clearly demonstrates that Aberdeen was at the forefront of Scottish trade to the New World as far back as the th century.ldquoOur archives are recognised as being of outstanding historic importance to the UK, and we are extremely fortunate that our cityrsquos forefathers had the good sense to keep these records safe for future generations to learn from and enjoy."},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-mackays-budget-leaves-swinney-in-a-spin","story":"Affronted by a hubbub of interruptions from Labour MSPs, led by the partyrsquos finance spokesman John Kelly, Mr Swinney heckled loudly back, prompting a rebuke from the presiding officer.ldquoCan I just ask members please to keep quiet for a second and letrsquos hear the questions without bellowing out, ordered Ken Macintosh.ldquoI am particularly referring to Mr Swinney and Mr Kelly. Do not bellow at each other across the chamber.Given initial reactions to the spending plans for education in the Budget, Mr Swinney is likely to be involved in more heated exchanges in the coming weeks.The stakes are high. The Scottish Government has made the improvement of education its defining mission and in his statement to the Scottish Parliament Mr Mackay reiterated that objective.ldquoThis government has made clear that our priority is closing the attainment gap and improving education, he said.ldquoWe are determined to improve the le chances of children in Scotland and change the lives of our future generations for the better.This, he argued would be assisted by a ldquoreal terms increase in investment in the education portfolio for   with pound million to expand nursery education and over poundm for schools to improve performance and close the attainment gap - including poundm for the Pupil Equity Fundwhich channels money directly to schools in disadvantaged areas.This ldquoall is well approach was met with immediate scepticism from Mr Kelly who said council services were at ldquobreaking point with headteachers already writing to parents warning them of unprecedented cuts.The response from council umbrella body Cosla yesterday was equally downbeat with officials arguing the settlement amounted to a real terms cut once extra money for delivering new policies such as the roll-out of free nursery care were stripped out.Stephen McCabe, the organisationrsquos education spokesman, said: ldquoThey say they are putting additional money in, but it seems to be a rebranding of money that is already in the system, such as investment for PEF and the early years.ldquoThe simple reality is that when you strip out that money for new responsibilities local government revenue has been cut by poundm.ldquoThat cannot but impact on education given that it is such a large part of every councilrsquos budget. We were anticipating a poor settlement, but this is a very poor settlement.The other pressing concern for schools is the increasing likelihood of a teacher strike next year as unions move towards a ballot following the rejection of their demands for a ten per cent pay hike.Mr Mackay confirmed his public sector pay policy would provide no more than a three per cent rise for those earning pound, or less insisting it was ldquoreasonable and acceptable.Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland, strongly disagrees and sees nothing in the draft Budget that will delay the prospect of industrial action.ldquoWe are disappointed on the pay front and it reflects a degree of complacency on the governments part to the mood of public sector workers. It will fan the flames of discontent amongst teachers, he said.For headteachers the extra kick in the teeth is the Scottish Governmentrsquos refusal to adopt the Westminster Governmentrsquos increase in the higher rate of tax threshold which will squeeze salaries even further at a time when it is proving hard to recruit new school leaders.And Mr Swinney has a new headache. Last year, universities were relatively happy with the Budget because they believed ministers had finally acknowledged that further cuts in public funding was leaving them in a precarious position.Mr Mackayrsquos brief reference in his statement to ldquoover pound billion for universities neatly skirted over the fact this amounts to a real terms cut of . per cent.Universities are already having to rely on fees income from overseas student to subsidise the cost of teaching Scottish students and research funding is also under pressure.Professor Andrea Nolan, convener of Universities Scotland, said institutions would find it ldquodficult to deal with cuts which threatened the future viability of the countryrsquos world renowned higher education sector."},{"url":null,"title":"andrew-mckie-the-current-crop-of-conservative-mps-is-not-nearly-vicious-enough","story":"To comprehend something is not just to comprise or include it, but to grasp it by means of understanding. One of the strengths of human comprehension is ndash or ought to be ndash the ability to imagine enthusiasms we donrsquot share. You may not care for the work of Bob Dylan, or El Greco, but you should be able to see that other people do and,you have any developed sympathy, even find it possible to think of reasons why they do.:EU leaders tell Theresa May Brexit withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiationThe current state of politics, more isive than ever, reflects a worrying dismissal of this basic human capability. If you smugly dismiss, for example, anyone who votes for Brexit or the SNP as a moronic bigot, it is your own political stance that is thoughtless and prejudiced.Thatrsquos not to say you canrsquot strongly object to and oppose thosepolitical positions, think them wrongheaded or even ndash though this judgment should be made with caution ndash wicked. If, however, you never pause to wonder why anyone might take a position contrary to yours, it doesnrsquot augur well for the foundations of your beliefs and, as a practical consideration, doesnrsquot give you the necessary equipment to build on them and withstand your opponentsrsquo claims.Which is why it is so baffling when something happens that seems genuinely incomprehensible. I refer, of course, to the  Conservative MPs who voted on Wednesday night to keep Theresa May as their leader. Try as I might, I cannot see any way in which this decision makes any sense.I think we can take it as read that only one of those  votes ndash that of the Rt Hon Theresa May, MP ndash was cast out of any genuine conviction that the Prime Minister is the right person for the job. So what can have been the motivation for the others If you wanted to make sure that Brexit went ahead, but to avoid departing on WTO terms ndash the ldquono deal exit those in the European Research Group either actively want, or are at least prepared to put up with ndash then voting for Mrs May guaranteed that you cannot get it. Of all the possible means of delivering Brexit, the one we know to be the worst, and the least likely to command support in the Commons, is the Prime Ministerrsquos.Even those who led the Leave campaign think that itrsquos a worse outcome than remaining. With the exception of halting free movement , it fails to deliver any of the fundamental elements of leaving, while removing any UK say in the policies, and costs. And potentially permanently,the Irish backstop were triggered. There is no equivalent of Article  for leaving the customs union, or the supervision of the EU Court of Justice,that happens. Sothe PM gets her withdrawal agreement through Parliament, you donrsquot get Brexit. Andshe canrsquot, you get to crash out ndash in which case, you might as well have voted against her, so that some kind of preparation could be made.If, on the other hand, you want to remain in the EU, or for some unfathomable reason think that a second referendum would improve matters, the only prospect of achieving those ends would have been to get shot of Mrs May, whose sole discernable quality is a pig-headed refusal ever to change her mind. A vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister might not have got Remainers what they want, but a vote for her more or less assured them that they wonrsquot.So much for the political positions or,yoursquore charitable, principles. But, though it may shock you to consider such a thing, MPs do not always vote purely in accordance with their beliefs. Venial, and indeed venal, considerations may also play a part.To put it bluntly, the question of whether they are going to hang on to their seats looms large in the thinking of most MPs, and Mrs Mayrsquos contribution to that ambition is hardly stellar. Quite apart from her record as the worst Prime Minister since, at the very least, David Cameron, shersquos also a shockingly bad tactician and an abysmal campaigner. This, remember, is the strategic genius who threw away a perfectly workable majority, and has since managed to annoy the DUP, on whose votes she now depends, more than any other group in the Commons.Whether any other Tory leader would give them a better chance at the next General Election is an open question . What a change would certainly have done, though, would have been to make a vote of no confidence from the Opposition much more dficult, probably allowing the Government to run its full term.Of course, one way Mrs May seems to have talked round her backbenchers is by promising them that she wonrsquot lead the party into the next General Election. While thatrsquos welcome news, Irsquom damnedI can see why itrsquos any sort of recommendation. If shersquos so chronic at her job that she is bound to lose it ndash even when the alternative is Jeremy Corbyn ndash why should that be a compelling case for staying in it pro tem, in order to deliversomething literally no one wants On Wednesday, the First Minister tweeted that the vote was ldquoa stark reminder that the UK is facing chaos and crisis entirely because of a vicious civil war within the Tory party. But alas, the lesson of the vote was exactly the opposite of Nicola Sturgeonrsquos claim. Unlike the ruthless Tory party of old, the current crop of Conservative MPs is not nearly vicious enough. If they were, they would have got rid of Mrs May as their leader on June , . And even now, they donrsquot get it."},{"url":null,"title":"a-picture-of-friendship-affectionate-portrait-of-scottish-gallery-staff-features-in-portrait-exhibition","story":"A picture of friendship: affectionate portrait of Scottish gallery staff features in portrait exhibitionArtist Miriam Escofet with her overall winning portrait of her mother #An Anltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtgel at my Table#ltspan classtruncate-full-screengt at the  BP Portrait Award exhibition at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh until th March .

The article is primarily a criticism of the acrimony, isiveness and damage Brexit has already caused our nation, which is a fact, and concludes that the only rational solution to the impasse is for this important decision on our future to be ed to the people.Contrary to what your correspondent claims, at no point does Mr Mackay blame or denigrate those who in  sincerely voted Leave. Indeed, he explicitly acknowledges that ldquohow we are seen as a country ldquoshould shame every one of us whether we are Leavers or Remainers. The problem is how we solve this.We are in this unenviable and damaging position because of flawed, and essentially self-serving, judgments made by our presentgoverning party. It was the Conservatives who called a referendum promising a Brexit that, from the start, was inherently undeliverable. It was undeliverable because it necessarily compromised the Good Friday Agreement ndash something our present PM, a former Home Secretary, must have been fully aware of. Furthermore, important sectors of the electorate were denied a vote and the referendum was abused by both sides.Ultimately we are in this situation because we have an outdated electoral system which is fundamentally unrepresentative. That is why we have the mediocre Government and Opposition which have presided, and are presiding, over this mess, which they are now unable to cope with. It seems to me the EU has been remarkably tolerant towards us.Since the Brexit we were led to expect in  is not, and never will be, possible, why should the British people have to shut up and settle for a second-rate substitute we did not vote for and which will make our already stretched country even poorer  It is reasonable and democratic to ask people againthis is what we really wanted or expected.Robert Bell, Stewarton Drive,The Herald, Cambuslang.IN this total mess of Brexit let me inject a few hard facts. First, the whole process was started by David Cameron as a political move to thwart Ukip in the  General Election and to unite the Tory Party. It was not done in response to any demand from the general population for a referendum to leave Europe. In this purpose it has been a stunning failure.The promise that Brexit would cut the free movement of people and immigration was one of the driving forces behind the majority Leave vote. My second fact is that, whilst the number of Europeans coming to the UK has indeed dropped considerably, their place has been taken by people from other parts of the world and the net migration figure has stayed more or less constant. Those coming from non-EU countries are currently coming through UK borders that are \"controlled\" and in accordance with the UKs immigration policy.My final fact is that this whole process has cost pound. billion so far . In contrast, in his Budget the Chancellor gave a mere poundbn over five years to ease the transition into Universal Credit whilst the Governments policy to freeze benefits, which is continuing to  , cuts nearly poundbn a year from the benefits bill.All this misery to safeguard the Tory Party ndash is it worth it Judith Gillespie, Findhorn Place, Edinburgh.IF the UK does finally leave the EU with a backstop arrangement with Northern Ireland in place and the SNP is able to get independence through successfully and regain EU membership therein lies a problem.

It isn’t intended to be a ‘straight’ narrative as you usually see, but as in a fairy tale there are strange detours, unexplained events, outcomes out of all proportion to what caused them – a kind of rough and dangerous magic working beneath the surface.Aside from that, each page of the book was crafted to be as inidually beautul as I could make it. Every page took at least a few days to create, and some pages took weeks, even months.Where did the inspiration for this book come from There are so many ideas that have fed into The Boy with Nails for Eyes that it’s very hard to pin it down to a single moment of inspiration. When I was at school, I was struck by a painting done by a previous student. It was a very unnerving picture — a spectral, jagged figure with crude smears of black where the eyes should be.Many years later I saw the music video for the Tool song Sober. There was a brief glimpse of a mechanical figure with a metal mask for a face, with one eye missing and the other pierced by this huge swivelling nail. I thought of Norse mythology — Odin, sacricing one of his eyes in the well of Mimir to gain wisdom. That second image married with the memory of the painting from school that same evening, I painted the first picture of The Boy with Nails for Eyes. A few weeks later, the story began to slowly take shape.It’s changed beyond recognition over the years, taking on influences such as the War on Terror of the early s. I was born in Bahrain and was there during the Gulf War. We were all issued with gas masks by the American military, and I remember waking up one night to find the rest of my family in my room, my mum holding the masks, my dad stuffing a towel under the door. It turned out Iraq had launched a Scud — we were all terried of the thought of chemical weapons. I recognised that same feeling of paranoia in the days after September the th, and Bush’s declaration of the War on Terror. That feeling pervades the story.How did the crowdfunding for this book come about I had been shopping the comic around to agents and publishers for a long time. I found it to be a frustrating process. I tended to receive positive responses, which were still rejections. I was running out of options, and was wondering where I’d go nextI wasn’t able to place it with anyone. I received a boost when the book was long-listed for the Myriad First Graphic Novel competition earlier this year.I was speaking to an editor at Unbound, the publisher, about an entirely dferent project — an illustrated poem. Almost as an aside I mentioned that I had this other graphic novel whose first volume was finished and ready to go. I showed her the first couple of chapters and she fell in love with it . We decided to temporarily shelve the other project and proceed with this.What would it mean to you to see this book published It would be fantastic. I’ve been working on the project over  years, since my early twenties. It’s been a labour of love — for myself and my we Anna as well, who had major input into the work. I honestly had no thought of publishing it properly, it was just important to me to allow it to be exactly the story it needed to be. I basically taught myself digital art by working on it, and honed my drawing and writing skills through it. It sounds strange, but I’m as much its product as it is mine. Having it out there as a book, something physical that can be picked up and read, would make it real in a way that it isn’t yet, for all that I’m satisfied that the story is what it should be – or near as I can make it.To find our more about The Boy with Nails for Eyes and support Shaun#s project visit: www.unbound books nails-for-eyes copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But the hotel’s own website was offering the deal at the same price, and claimed the full price was £ less than advertised on Groupon. Meanwhile, a tri-fold mirror advertised as £ full price was actually available for £ from the official retailer.Harry Rose, editor of Which  Magazine, said: “Customers should be able to trust that pricing information they see on Groupon and other deal websites is accurate, so they can make an informed decision about whether to part with their cash.“As the Christmas shopping frenzy begins, consumers should be on guard and not take every deal at face value. Groupon must also stringently review its deals to ensure there is no risk of customers being misled.”Which  also found examples of misleading terms and conditions. One deal offering a choice of burger, and a bottomless drink, with  per cent off the standard price featured a photo of a double-decker beef burger. However, hidden away in the small print was a line making clear that the burger in the photo was not part of the deal.Groupon removed all of the deals, misleading images or prices flagged up to it by Which .A spokeswoman for Groupon said: “Transparency on our pricing is incredibly important to us.

From Raiders of the Lost Ark to The Crystal Skull, these movies provided swashbuckling, testosterone-fuelled adventures that kept us, the audience, glued to the screen. Would Indiana win through against the odds, overcoming the baddies and cheats  The more I think about it, with all the spiders, creepy crawlies and snakes he had to deal with, it was like a precursor for I’m a Celebrity ... get me out of here! My favourite Indiana Jones movie was Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade starring Sir Sean Connery. Long and short, they go after the Holy Grail, the cup of Christ, andone drinks from it, one has eternal le. And living longer seems to be in vogue not only for Indiana, but for us all. Hence the current fascination with all sorts of potions and exercise routines to keep us fit into our nineties. Who needs the Holy Grail when we have Davina MCall DVDs The search for the Holy Grail, which in today’s money, means living a healthy le to the top end of the le expectancy charts cannot be achieved by drinking from an alleged mythical chalice. No, to become the fittest person in the old folks Home, one has to live a le that resembles a Cistercian monk’s. Just how happy the monks are is a matter for interpretation. But, let’s explore this ... for the sake of a longer le.My own expectation of a long and healthy le was set at . Yes, I was pretty happy to be healthy to , then head downhill and be dead by . Some of you maybe thinking this was a wee bit too pessimistic, especially when the le expectancy for Scotland has males topping out at  years of age and in Spain, where I now live, a whopping  years. But, I had reasons for my own personal le expectancy. I was more focussed on how useful me and my body would actually be at . I anticipated that my mind would deteriorate, my water works would be dysal and my sex le would be, well, a Mills and Boon book at bedtime with my cocoa. I would dribble when I drank my tea and spill gravy down my front at the Christmas table, while others placed large napkins on my chest and stomach to catch it all. : You don’t need to pull on trainers to stay healthy, finds studySo,  sounded okay and probably a good estimation of my usefulness and mobility. But, and it’s now a big, huge, audacious and positive but, it seems I need to reset my calibrations for old age as I seem to be doing okay –the latest health news is to be believed.A recent study in the USA of , people over a -year period has highlighted the brutal truth behind living a long and healthily le. Like I said, it’s a bit monk-like! But, nevertheless it appears that there are five areas of our lives that we can proactively improve to add years to our time on this earth. And not just years of visiting doctors for statins and high-blood pressure pills either. So, I’m now going to provide you with a sort of Holy Grail of longer le. Notebooks out... here it is: eat a healthy diet get regular exercise maintain a healthy body weight don’t smoke and drink alcohol in moderation.And there was you thinking it was going to be a ground-breaking, Indiana Jones ‘woohoo journey’ into good times. But alas, there is nothing new here. However, the research showed that people who made a conscious effort to abide by these lestyle choices, lived longer. Indeed, much longer.: Millennials trying to be ‘too healthy’ with excessive exercise and supplementsDo those things and compared to people who don’t meet any of those criteria,you’re a woman in the US, your le expectancy improves from  to . years. If you’re a man, your le expectancy increases from . to . years. Yes, women get  additional years and men get  more years. So, there is the opportunity to live a longer and more healthy le well into your eighties.I am smug enough to share with you that I think I’m doing okay with the first four on the list. But, the yummy Monestrall red wine that I now favour is probably setting me back a bitI’m honest. But this leads to another eye-opener that the research has thrown up. Certainly,you can live like a monk and adhere to all five long-le determinants, then bully for you.But, the majority of us may only be able to achieve three out of the five. Researchers found a “dose-response relationship” between each inidual healthy lestyle behaviour and a reduced risk of early death. In non researcher-speak, that means any lestyle improvements you make will positively impact your le expectancy. Bonus! A bit of good fortune that plays out better than three numbers in the National Lottery.Making lestyle choices is hard. It takes determination and discipline, hence my monk analogy. A couple of glasses of red wine is good, when compared to seven pints down the pub on a Friday and Saturday night.Taking a -minute walk each day in the wind and rain isn’t easy and takes motivation. But, the research seems to show that these changes, when all put together, increase the opportunities for a longer, healthier le.

However, her failure to negotiate the car door on arrival in Germany left her with a bigger riddy than any gubbing she would face in Parliament, including the confidence vote.This immediately put her on the back foot in terms of trying to renegotiate our messy orce settlement and likely blew any chance she may have had of gaining custody of the Simply Red CDs. But she might still get that DVD of Funeral in Berlin.I imagine she felt the same as a ScotRail passenger tasked with opening a train door with an outside handle, while a group of angry office workers wait to alight.At this rate, May will be “coming to a garden centre near you shortly” to while away the time drinking coffee and eating traybakes when she is eventually handed her jotters.Meanwhile, the Irish passport office has been inundated with Scots asking for their  Euros back after realising they were a tad hasty in pretending to be from the Emerald Isle, just to get past airport security a bit quicker.“But I’ve never even been there, my grandad died before I was born and no I haven’t met my cousin Plunkett ... I don’t even like Guinness.” Of course, I jest but this Brexit malarkey is no laughing matter.: Brexit deal still in limbo as May refuses to name new vote dateAs self-appointed spokesperson for ‘most people’ – in this case, the ones who voted for Remain – I’d like to say I did so in the belief that voting to stay in the European Union was the right thing to do. Born and bred in the Athens of the North, I consider myself an enlightened Renaissance man of upper working-class stock. I can order both a coffee with milk and the bill in Spanish and have been to the Majorcan holiday resort of Santa Ponsa no less than  times. You don’t get more European than that.However, my knowledge of the EU was scant to say the least and,forced to name a Member of the European Parliament before the referendum, I would have said ... Nigel Farage and left it there. It was something to do with Ted Heath, that rang a bell in the back of my mind, and I always found the Sun headline ‘Up Yours Delors’ funny.So, no I didn’t really have a clue what I was voting for other than to maintain the status quo. This is why I find it a bit rich when fellow Remoaners belittle those who voted Leave with the standard accusation that they, like me, didn’t know what they were voting for.Granted some of them didn’t have a clue and fell for the populist propaganda around the immigration issue and not wanting to let “that Isis” into the UK.There was all the nonsense around migrants being military men of fighting age as opposed to -year-old bairns looking for shelter – so they must have been part of “that Isis”, looking to set up a caliphate in Sunderland. Here’s to you, Tommy Robinson. : EU has fun with Theresa May’s Brexit plightThen there was the £ million sent to the EU every week that could supposedly be spent on the NHS, according to Boris and the battle bus. A mere drop in the ocean – NHS Tayside chiefs would have spent that in a fortnight.But there were genuine concerns around the make-up of the EU, seen by some as a bastion of corrupt neoliberalism as national populism swept across countries like Hungary, Italy, Poland and Austria before landing in the good old US of A. No less a figure than Jeremy Corbyncan barely disguise his contempt for the European Union and the current new version of Old Labour has concerns about the threat migration poses to skilled workers in the frozen north of England.Of course, the real baddie in all of this is David Cameron.‘Cam the Bam’ made the schoolboy error of asking the public what they thought. He offered them a choice to keep things as they were or opt for the specials board at the local Wetherspoons, which was offering homemade sticky toffee pudding and ice-cream with a hard Brexit.This was an open goal to Vote Leave who were ahead of the curve in judging the public to be fed up with elites and feeling their elective representatives did not speak up for blue-collar workers or indeed no-collar workers in the shape of the so-called underclass.Back in BC, Plato the Greek philosopher knew his onions when it came to referenda and the masses. He believed that “a good decision is based on knowledge and not on a number” and was scared that a majority of people would make poor choices and could be too easily influenced by demagogues. This is something characters like Farage and Trump have exploited to the maximum but old Plato predicted this kind of thing all those years ago. And yet people still express surprise at the results of the EU referendum and the US election.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4843976.1544739028!/image/image.jpg","title":"new measures planned to create zero tolerance of harassment at scottish parliament","story":"Complaints of sexual harassment against MSPs and former MSPs will be investigated independently and no longer time-barred under changes designed to introduce a culture of #zero tolerance#.The Joint Working Group on Sexual Harassment recommends that complaints against MSPs be referred to the Commissioner for Ethical Standards and that the one-year limit on raising complaints be scrapped.A report published yesterday says complaints against former MSPs or former members of staff should also be investigated.However, it notes that in such cases parliamentary sanctions can no longer be applied, citing a case where Holyrood’s standards committee decided it couldn’t do anything. Earlier this year, the committee found there was a lack of confidence in the way complaints are handled.It followed the resignation from the SNP of former minister Mark McDonald after he admitted causing a woman “considerable distress” after sending inappropriate text messages.Former First Minister Alex Salmond is currently taking legal action against the Scottish Government after it initiated complaint proceedings following allegations of sexual misconduct. Mr Salmond has denied any wrongdoing.Following a confidential survey of people working at Holyrood, the new report calls for the introduction of “an overarching policy on sexual harassment,” setting out a zero tolerance policy.It calls for the creation of an independent support service as a route which people can use to make a formal complaint.And it says formal complaints should be investigated independently of parliament and political parties, meaning by the Commissioner for Ethical Standards for MSPs. A joint letter to staff from Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh and Scottish Parliament chief executive Paul Grice said: “Important as policies and procedures are, we each have a duty to ensure our own behaviour meets the standard expected and to challenge the behaviour of others that falls short. “And, while we want to ensure that any complaint is dealt with sensitively and fairly, we remain focussed on our goal of preventing sexual harassment happening in the first place. Achieving that will require the combined efforts of the parliament, the political parties and all those who work in and visit Holyrood and we are grateful for your continued support.”A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “We are committed to ensuring that everyone has the right to live their le free of abuse, harassment and intimidation, and expect all employers to provide safe and supportive environments for their employees.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4841479.1544439622!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon support scottish independence and avoid narnia with idiots","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scotland#s First Minister branded Tory politicians #idiots# as she called on Scots to support independence.Following an article in the Sundaywhere allies of Boris Johnston likened him to Aslan in CS Lewis’s Narnia series ready to end he rule of the ice queen Theresa May, Nicola Sturgeon took to Twitter, to say Scottish voters could “opt to stay in the real world.”She wrote: “It’s hard to know whether to laugh or cry.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong  finally Mr Carmichael should know that the only reform of the eu that they will be doing is ever closer integration.

Well that DANGEROUS FANTASY has been seen to be a DANGEROUS REALITY since the referendum with EU armoured personel carriers on the streets of Paris battling french protestors.Is this DANGEROUS REALITY stuff for real Someone may have been listening to Trump and Farage#s comments on the EU army without turning on their b.s. filter.Why shouldn#t EU nations cooperate in defence matters  Is Ali saying NATO is a bad thing Since  it has become politically correct for democratic European neighbours to cooperate.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27497  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinSinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit. - Mary Lou McDonald TDAmid all the chaos in Westminster, there are few certainties as to where the Brexit circus will stumble to next.Brexit began as a squabble between the rich and right wing boys of the Tory party. Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh. Two other posts - at Clady and Strabane in Co Tyrone - were also to have been demolished that night but the bombs to be used exploded prematurely, killing three Volunteers at Stranamuck, near Castlefin, Co Donegal.Comdt John James Kelly and Staff Capt James Joseph Reynolds were killed instantly and Comdt Charles McCafferty died a few days later in Lford Hospital.The three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof. The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England.

He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years. In  he was charged along with six other men, including his twin brother, John Joseph, with the assassination of a rack-renting landlord, More OFarrell, at Edgeworthstown, Co Longford. After two trials the case was dismissed and there were bonfires for fty miles around to celebrate their escape from the Free State hangman.All three Volunteers received huge funerals with full IRA honours.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence.

We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line. It cannot and will not be abandoned or renegotiated,\" he said. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27508  ","story":" Síle DarraghWhen young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this state, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1307210.jpg--.jpg?1544629297000\n","title":"harmony hub to be winter wonderland","story":"Ballymena’s Harmony Hub is being transformed into a Winter Wonderland this week, with an igloo, log cabin, fairy houses and frozen tower set to spring up in the heart of the town.Visitors to the Winter Wonderland, taking place between Thursday th and Saturday th December, are invited to pop into Mrs Claus’ cabin, or say hello to the elves!The Christmas Fairy Godmother will also be in town to amaze the kids as she allows them inside and to experience the magical interior of her le-size tree.Jack Frost won’t be far away either!

My sacrice and dedication went to motorcycling and I’m very proud to be a Doctor of Letters because of that.“It’s a lelong sacrice. Since I was six-years-old I’ve travelled theand breadth of the UK racing. The injuries I’ve faced, the ups and downs, to actually win a world championship on top of all that is massive.“It’s nice that my family can see there was an endgame after all their sacrice in the beginning.Jonathan Rea shows off his new threads“It’s a very proud day for the whole family. Especially my two little boys , they realise that it’s not normal to be at an event like this. They know the ious race tracks inside out but this is dferent. I hope I can be a good role model for them.”The -year-old said it was the first time he had ever attended a graduation, adding: “I never imagined the first one would be my own.”Asked about his graduate attire for the ceremony, he said: “Of course I feel a lot more comfortable in leathers and a helmet but it’s really nice to be acknowledged outside the sport. It’s something that’s happening more and more recently.”The honorary degree follows the  award of an MBE on the New Year’s Honours list.

The college’s Patient Group is reminding people about the important ‘ Before GP’ message. Karen Mooney, chair, said: “This winter, we know that our GP practices are going to be under immense strain, and we can do our bit to help support our health service.

Over the winter period, there is no doubt that our workload hugely increases. “For more minor conditions such as coughs and colds, patients can get great advice and over the counter medicines from local pharmacies.

For after much soul searching and deliberating, Christina has decided to take her love for her community on to the next level by becoming a Sinn Féin City Hall rep. Christina has been co-opted on to Belfast City Council in place of the outgoing Councillor Mary McConville, who has stepped down for health reasons.“I’ve been involved in community work for twenty-three years now. One of my earliest memories is of me at five years old walking down the Grosvenor holding a sign that said, ‘We want heat not cold feet’ – my mummy had me involved in community work from no age, it’s in my blood,” Christina told the Andersonstown News, smiling at the memory.“I attended my first Belfast City Council meeting at the beginning of December. I was a bit nervous speaking, but I got through it. It was very interesting watching the dynamics of the Council.”Christina identied some of the issues that pushed her over the line when it came to making the decision to enter City Hall.“There are local issues that I want to make an impact on. I have given this a lot of thought and I discussed it with my husband before I made my decision, we both agreed that it’s the right path for me, I feel that it is a natural progression.“I want to make a dference and I want to carry on the good work of Mary McConville. I live in this area so I am well aware of the local issues and I find them as much a challenge as everyone .“I believe you should feel safe in your area, you should feel happy, you should benefit from generated investment. There are huge developments happening in the city centre, these should be impacting the areas around it to a greater extent, and I feel I can represent people fully in that respect.”Christina’s much-missed mother Belle was a renowned voluntary community worker –chairperson of the Roden Street Development Group at Grosvenor Community Centre.“My mother taught me that community is everything, she also taught me that a community worker is never off duty. She never feared going the extra mile to ensure that people got what they deserved.“I have been described as being parochial, which I don’t think is true, I am very open minded in my thinking. But I would agree I am there to represent local voters, so to a certain extent I must be parochial to genuinely bring that local voice forward.”Christina continued: “I’m the kind of person who works hard, but my mother, well, she worked tirelessly.Her door never stopped, people always turned to her.She gave everything andI can be half the woman she was I will be happy. I’m going to have to learn to manage my work-le balance, though.“Since my mummy passed away I have tried to continue her good work, she showed me the ropes and I think she would be delighted to see me take on this role. At the end of the day I work for this community and I promise to do all I can to ensure the people get what they are entitled to.“There’s a gap between the Grosvenor Road and the city centre that is crying out for investment. The Belfast Transport Hub is going in, which I believe will generate employment. I would love for our young people to be in a position to become engineers and the like. I would love to find a way to get them that training to elevate them to those amazing employment opportunities.“I really want better for our people, I am so proud of being from Roden Street and I will never leave the Grosvenor Community Centre, it’s been too many people’s le’s work. I want to do my Council work to the best of my abilities in my own time.“I’m going to try my hardest to do the best job possible for the people of this area and beyond.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"new report lays out bright future for west belfast","story":"A NEW report detailing the positive transformation that has taken place in West Belfast in recent years will be launched on tomorrow morning . ‘Vision : Transforming West Belfast’ will look to the future as well as outlining projects such as the James Connolly Interpretive Centre, Casement Park and the Roddy McCorley Society interactive museum and visitor centre.The report has been commissioned by Fáilte Feirste Thiar and the West Belfast Partnership Board and will highlight the amount of investment that has gone into the West of the city.Projects in the spotlight in the report include:•£m from Belfast City Council for the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre•m from the Department for Communities and Ciste for Áras na BhFál• £m for the Balmoral Hotel•£.m for the Blackmountain Shared Space Project•£m investment for Brook Leisure Centre•£m for the Falls Park City Cemetery MasterplanIn total, the report will list  projects in West Belfast that have benefited from investment.Speaking to the Andersonstown News ahead of the launch, Harry Connolly, Executive Director of Fáilte Feirste Thiar, said: “In recent years West Belfast has began to secure increased amounts of public sector investment.“Research undertaken for this publication has uncovered that this combined investment totals over £ million – a signicant figure.“Many people involved in our local private, public and community sectors will not be fully aware of the huge amount of work involved nor the scale of the investment secured.

He’s now been issued with a summons and was due to appear in court on Wednesday morning – but the hearing was adjourned for the second time.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, a gobsmacked Seamus said: “I’ve kept horses all my le, they are beautul creatures. I am in poor health and looking after these horses brings me a real sense of joy.”Seamus lives with COPD, is diabetic and has suffered multiple heart attacks.He continued: “I was giving bread to the horses, minding my own business, and these two characters approached me and demanded I stopped. This field belongs to my friend and I have permission to feed these horses. What harm was I doing  I don’t need the stress and strain of this.”Seamus described the encounter that led to the series of events that has left him baffled and angry.“I pulled my car up that morning and walked over to feed the horses, these two fellas shouted over at me and told me to stop. I told them to take themselves off, they said they were ringing the peelers and I told them to get whoever they wanted. One of the men said the birds were lting the bread I was feeding the horses and dropping it in his garden, absolute nonsense. I got into my car and drove off. Your man must have taken my car registration because I received a fixed penalty notice in the post.”Seamus added: “I turned up to court on the arranged date and the complainant never bothered turning up. I showed up again on Tuesday and the same thing, he never weighed in again. NowI didn’t bother turning up I’m sure they’d have something to say about that. This is a complete and utter waste of Belfast City Council time and money and I am urging them to drop it.”Local People Before Profit Councillor Matt Collins said: “This whole situation is ridiculous, whoever made the decision to issue a court summons to Seamus perhaps needs a basic crash course in what constitutes illegal or criminal behaviour. This summons should be withdrawn and Belfast City Council should apologise to Seamus immediately.“It’s also worth saying that Seamus is taking this in his stride and isn’t backing down – and fair play to him for that. But other people would likely be intimidated by this. Nobody wants brought up in front of a court and especially for something so absurd. I’d imagine the vast majority of people would agree with me that Belfast City Council and the powers-that-be in this city ought to put their time and energy into something more productive, instead of hauling a pensioner up in front of a court for feeding horses.”A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said that as this is an ongoing matter they would not be making any comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the fureys uniting generations through music","story":"DESPITE its relatively small population, ours has never been a country with a shortage of musicians on the international stage, but few of them have had an impact as lasting as The Fureys.Formed in the , the iconic folk group has entertained audiences throughout the world for  years. While the band’s line-up has inevitably changed over the years, brothers George and Eddie Furey have continued to tour the globe, bringing the finest ballads to generations old and new.To celebrate their th anniversary they have released a new album, ‘The Fureys  Years On… to be continued’, and will play a headline gig at Belfast’s Waterfront this January.Ahead of the gig, the Andersonstown News met with George and Eddie, who had just ed from the Netherlands leg of their jubilee tour. While their music has touched thousands,not millions of people, George and Eddie are a pair without air and graces. Our chat was an informal one that took place in the Waterfront Hall’s lobby, with school kids, excited by their trip to the panto, providing an excitable background hum. As for the story of The Fureys – it’s one of famous faces, infamous sessions, and more years worth of craic than can be adequately depicted in a single newspaper article. However, with the release of their new album – which foregoes many of the obvious tracks and is jammed full of new material – our conversation almost immediately turned to things more current.“A lot of the songs we would’ve heard as kids and would’ve grown up singing them,” Eddie explained.“Streets of London is one of them, which was written by Ralph McTell, and we know Ralph going back many, many years.”George added: “The first track on the album was written by a Donegal man, Jordy Gallagher, and he wrote the song about eight years ago. “Joe, our manager knows him very well and he gave our manager the song to have a listen to because he thought it might suit on the album because it’s a protest song. A lot of those songs from years ago are all protest songs, from the s.“We grew up with all these protest years ago. There was a great song years ago called The Eve of Destruction, and it’s about what would happen to ussomeone dropped the big bomb – we grew up with those songs. So this song really suits the album.”“The Day’s Gonna come is a great song,” Eddie concurred. “The song tells you what’s happening to the world and those older songs tell you what was happening at that time. The words are ‘the day is gonna come when the water runs out and the wells run try, man’s so dumb, fish can’t swim and birds can’t fly’.”He continued: “There’s also peace songs, love songs, and drinking songs. “We’ve sang an awful lot of love songs over the years too. Songs that our mother used to sing and our father used to sing, Sweet Sixteen and that sort of stuff.”Although it’s an anniversary album, the new CD is new territory for The Fureys, who had not previously recorded much of its material. But much like their previous albums, The Fureys have continued to record songs from some of world’s best songwriters.“The songs are mostly from people we’ve met over the years on our tours,” Eddie said.“We’ve sang a lot of great ballads over the years.“We even recorded an album of Charlie Chaplin songs. Josie, Charlie Chaplin’s second youngest daughter, was cleaning out her father’s house and she found five songs that were never recorded before, written by Charlie Chaplin, and she asked uswe would do the songs. We had to do them, and we had to do them with an orchestra. We had a -piece orchestra in the studio with us recording these great songs.”George added: “We do a mix of stuff – not just Irish songs. If you listen to some of the bands now they’re going back on the old stuff. To me, you can’t beat the real thing.”Unlike some older musicians and music fans, The Fureys are not consumed with thoughts of past ‘glory days’. On the contrary, George admits that music is “probably more versatile now”. Instead the past only serves to make their current concerts more fulfilling as they bring together people who have followed them through the generations.“A lot of the kids that come to see us now, their grandparents or parents would’ve come to our concerts and bought our albums,” George said. “Now we have kids coming to concerts with their grandma and grandpa.”Eddie noted: “People grew up with our stuff and they love to see it live.”The Fureys have united generations and their music has been played everywhere from their hometown in Dublin to the International Space Station – where astronaut Chris Hadfield famously played their track ‘Steal Away’ – but of all other places outside of their hometown, it’s in Belfast where they feel most at home.“We’ve been up here so many times it’s like our second home,” George insisted.“We used to play in the Ulster Hall before this was built. We used to bring the wives up to do the Christmas shopping, because it was cheaper up here. Then we’d smuggle it across the border. If you got caught at customs they’d take it off you – drink and everything – party time. We had some parties like.”He continued: “This is our tenth gig here, which I never knew until this morning. It was only opened up when we first played here. They know what to expect – people are used to coming to see us. They always ask for some of the old songs, and we have to do them. People will ask for some dferent songs too, and we can do them no problem.”Eddie added: “We’ll be singing some songs off the new album too. You have to add them in here and there. If a request comes up for an old song we like to keep people happy.”The Furey’s play at the Waterfront Hall on January , .

Mr Varadkar, who had earlier met Prime Minister Theresa May, said that efforts to get the UK Parliament to raty a deal centre on \"explanations, assurances and clarications\". For the moment, the assurances are political, but the Taoiseach notably did not rule out some kind of legal device.Though Mrs May beat a no confidence motion tabled by her Conservative colleagues, the draft Withdrawal Agreement remains as far away as ever from the necessary approval of her MPs.The Taoiseach insisted that all EU leaders were totally agreed that the EU-UK deal cannot be reopened in efforts to overcome British MPs hostility. But every effort would be made by the EU to help the MPs understand and hopefully support the draft deal.\"I can tell you the backstop is not on the table. It needs to be there for a number of reasons,\" the Taoiseach said on his way into the EU summit meeting.\"It needs to be there to give us the assurance that there will be no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, thus protecting the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement,\" he continued. \"It needs to be there for European reasons as well, giving Europe the assurance that the open border will not become the backdoor to the single market,\" the Taoiseach added.Mr Varadkar has said he expects assurances given by Mrs May on the Northern Ireland backstop to be honoured.\"What we want is an enduring assurance that there will not be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, no matter what the circumstances,\" he said.He suggested Britain could lt the threat of a no-deal Brexit by suspending - or ending altogether - the Article  withdrawal process.\"It is possible,the UK wishes to, to revoke Article  or,that is a step too far, to seek an extension of Article  so that the UK Parliament has more time to come together and decide what they would like the outcome to be,\" he said.\"It is absolutely within the gt of the United Kingdom to take no-deal off the tablethey wish to.\"Earlier, Tanaiste Simon Coveney said the backstop is not about the UK, but is about ensuring no border infrastructure re-emerges under any circumstances.He also said during Leaders Questions in the Dail that any reassurances being sought by Mrs May could not be allowed to undermine the purpose of the backstop.\"What is being looked at now seriously is how a political declaration can be put together, that is real, that provides reassurance, for many in Westminster who need it, that the backstop represents no threat to them, no threat to the UK and instead actually is about providing reassurance on the island of Ireland,\" Mr Coveney said.\"That we can reassure people that under no circumstances in the future as a result of Brexit will there be border infrastructure re-emerging between the two jurisdictions on this island.\""},{"url":null,"title":"defiant may vows to get on with job and deliver brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Its not the way I voted, however I will fully respect the result.\"It was Mrs Mays decision to pull a vote on her deal in the face of what she acknowledged would have been a heavy defeat earlier this week which sparked a new wave of letters of no-confidence from Tories, triggering the challenge to her position.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that the \"dismal\" deal should be put before MPs next week.\"The Prime Minister has lost her majority in Parliament, her Government is in chaos and she is unable to deliver a Brexit deal that works for the country and puts jobs and the economy first,\" Mr Corbyn said.\"Its clear that she has not been able to negotiate the necessary changes in Europe.\"She must now bring her dismal deal back to the House of Commons next week so Parliament can take back control.\"Labour MPs described Mrs May as a \"lame duck\" due to her decision to pre-announce her departure.Mrs May said after the result: \"While delivering Brexit is important, we also need to focus on the other issues that people feel are vital to them and matter to them today. The issues that we came into politics to deal with, building a stronger economy, delivering first-class public services, building the homes that families need.\"We owe it to the people who put us here to put their priorities first. So here is our renewed mission: delivering the Brexit that people voted for, bringing the country back together and building a country that truly works for everyone.\"Mrs Mays victory in the vote means that another challenge cannot be mounted against her position as Tory leader for a year.But she still faces the danger of a no-confidence motion in the Commons, which could bring her Government downbacked by more than half of all MPs.Addressing MPs at a meeting of the  Committee moments before the crucial vote, Mrs May said she accepted she could not fight the next election as leader.Solicitor general Robert Buckland told reporters: \"She said, In my heart I would like to lead the party into the next election and then that was the introductory phrase to her indication that she would accept the fact that would not happen, that is not her intention.\"And, according to MPs at the meeting, she also promised to find a \"legally-binding solution\" to ensure that the UK does not get permanently trapped in a backstop arrangement."},{"url":null,"title":"civil service pay report lifts the lid on who gets what and where biggest differences lie","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Catholic pay at grade six is .% higher than the Protestant average.However, among staff who are not on NICS pay scales, Catholic average pay is .% lower than that of Protestants.The average pay of senior staff who have declared a disability is % higher than that of those with no disability.The report says that \"dferences of this type can arise from a complex range of factors\".Despite this, staff at grade six who have declared their disability earn .% less than their counterparts who have made no such declaration - while staff not on the NICS pay scale who have declared a disability earn .% more.Full-time civil servants average earnings here of £ per week are lower than those for full-time staff in the overall public sector at £ per week.However, they are higher than full-time workers in the private sector, who earn an average £ per week.A spokesperson for the Department of Finance said: \"There is no gender pay gap between male and female staff in the NICS. In line with the Equality Commission NI Code of Practice on Equal Pay, the NICS carries out annual equal pay audits and any gaps identied are investigated for appropriate corrective action.\"NISRA uses the median average, rather than the mean, as it is gives a less distorted impression of wages."},{"url":null,"title":"queens university graduations december","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He is now uncertain whether it will go ahead.He said the family had received \"unbelievable\" support from Lauras colleagues at Antrim Area Hospital, where she had worked for nine years and had been due to take charge of a new unit.\"Everyone is absolutely devastated, they have said the hospital is in mourning,\" he added.\"Theyve opened a book of condolence and have a picture of Laura in the hospital chapel. There will be a nursing guard of honour at the service, which is a lovely gesture.\"Keelan also thanked the community for supporting a Justgiving page set up in Lauras memory, which by last night had raised nearly £,. The sum will be split between the Buddy Bear Trust, which supports children with cerebral palsy and other motor disorders and has helped little Lorcan, and Antrim Area Hospital ICU.\"This will be Lauras legacy,\" Keelan added.\"The staff at Antrim ICU treated us with such respect, and Lorcan goes to the school run by the Buddy Bear Trust once a week.\"The family and I are astounded by the support. Laura will be up in Heaven thinking: All that fuss for me!\"Speaking on behalf of their parents John and Sheila Brooker, Andrewdescribed his sister as a \"very dedicated mum\".\"From the point where they turned off the le support Laura had  minutes - the first  of that was the drugs, but the last  she was trying to support herself,\" he revealed.\"She was a lovely, caring person. She was incredibly popular at the hospital and known for being dedicated to her job. It is heartbreaking that Lorcan will grow up without his mum. My mum, dad and Keelan are so full of praise for how the nursing staff cared for Laura. \"We would like to thank the community for their support, and everyone who donated. We are expecting a large turnout at the service, and we are asking people to wear bright colours. We want it to be a celebration, not a mourning.\"Lauras funeral Mass will take place at noon today in St Comgalls Church in Antrim.To donate, visit www.justgiving crowdfunding laura-burns."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland travel child knocked down in newtownards","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He said he was not clear what the DUP leader was saying in regard to her oversight of Dr Andrew Crawford.\"She has a saying that she is accountable but not responsible,\" he said. \"I, for myself, am not entirely clear what that might mean.\"He pressed DUP barrister Julie Ellison over whether Mrs Foster should share more of the blame for a number of failings. These included not picking up on warnings from the whistleblower Janette OHagan, a lack of record-keeping at ministerial meetings and not realising Dr Crawford hadnt read detailed RHI reports.Ms Ellison said Mrs Foster felt Ms OHagan deserved a \"sincere apology\", that she was unaware officials werent taking minutes, and it was for the  to decide whether Mrs Foster gave proper instructions to Dr Crawford.Regarding the \"shadowy world\" of special advisers, Ms Ellison told the  they had broken the rule of never becoming the story.Former DUP minister Jonathan Bell has claimed top DUP Spad Timothy Johnston directed another adviser, Timothy Cairns, not to introduce cuts and to work instead with fellow adviser Dr Crawford.Ms Ellison said Mr Johnston had no interest or influence over RHI in the summer of . A barrister for Mr Cairns went on to say he acted \"reasonably and appropriately\" over RHI, but agreed some aspects could have been carried out better."},{"url":null,"title":"pm must stand up to eu leaders on brexit backstop arlene foster","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

May appeals to EU leaders to save her Brexit deal A text was published on the conclusions of the summit. It said preparations would intensy on all possible outcomes.It stated the European Council was committed to the agreement reached in November - which has seen the Conservative party tear itself apart and Theresa May face a leadership challenge and the Commons unite against the deal. Earlier this week Theresa May pulled her meaningful vote on the deal as there was not enough support to see it through. After seeing off a Tory rebellion on Wednesday Theresa May travelled to Brussels to seek assurances on the deal. Mr Tusk said: \"Today Prime Minister May informed the leaders about the dficulties with ratying the deal in London and asked for further assurances that would at least in her view unlock the ratication process in the House of Commons. \"After discussing the Prime Ministers intervention among the  leaders, and bearing in mind our full respect of the parliamentary process in the United Kingdom, we have agreed the following: first, the European Council reconfirmed its conclusions of the th November  in which it endorsed the Withdrawal Agreement and approved the Political Declaration. \"The Union stands by this agreement and intends to proceed with its ratication. It is not open for renegotiation.\"The text stated it wanted to \"establish as close as possible a partnership with the United Kingdom in the future,\" and was ready to begin work on a trade deal once the document was signed off. Jean-Claude Juncker also said the UK  It said the backstop was needed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland and to ensure the integrity of the single market. \"It is the Union’s firm determination to work speedily on a subsequent agreement that establishes by  December  alternative arrangements, so that the backstop will not need to be triggered,\" the text stated. \"The European Council also underlines that,the backstop were nevertheless to be triggered, it would apply temporarily, unless and until it is superseded by a subsequent agreement that ensures that a hard border is avoided. \"In such a case, the Union would use its best endeavours to negotiate and conclude expeditiously a subsequent agreement that would replace the backstop, and would expect the same of the United Kingdom, so that the backstop would only be in place for as long as strictly necessary.\"The text continued: \"The European Council calls for work on preparedness at all levels for the consequences of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal to be intensied, taking into account all possible outcomes.\"European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker urged the UK to tell the EU what it wants in the future relationship. He said: \"We also think that in terms of the future relationship our UK friends need to say what they want, instead of asking us to say what we want and so we would like within a few weeks our UK friends to set out their expectations for us because this debate is sometimes nebulous and imprecise and I would like clarications. \"As we dont know what the collective reactions will be from the Europe  and the UK, the Commission on the th December will publish all the information that is generally useful for the preparation of no deal, this is preparedness.\"Mr Juncker added that he was \"still of the opinion that Mrs May is fighting hard and bravely but we have not seen results\". \"We would like a peaceful relationship with the UK for the yearsbut in particular we dont want the UK to think there can be any form of renegotiation whatsoever. \"We can add some clarications... but there will be no renegotiations.\""},{"url":null,"title":"eu vote cost almost 10m to deliver","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He is also a member of Victoria Park and Tower Hamlets AC which won the South of England Athletic Association Fell Running Championships on the Isle of Wight in September, with Aaron winning the inidual title. These championships comprise three races in two days, with the first two races on Saturday and the third and longest, on Sunday.The races are not by any means easy inidually, or collectively, the first being .k, but with an ascent of  metres, the second k with an ascent of  metres and the third, on the following day, k with a m ascent.Aaron was first and second respectively in the first two of the races and he calculated that he could win overallhe finished in fourth place in the third race on Sunday morning.His eventual third place left him overall winner and as he said afterwards: ldquoIt was a beautul setting and some very hard racing, good mental preparation for the XC season coming up. How prophetic that was.To further emphasise his versatility, he ran the Amsterdam Half Marathon on October  and came home in ninth place, posting a superb .. which would have placed him fourth in the recent Belfast Half and sixth in the Waterside Half in Derry, so, he is a top quality runner over all terrains.Juniors at CookstownLauren Madine was the only female from the club juniors to take part in and duly won the U- girlsrsquo race at the Cookstown venue and ever-dependable Mackenzie Murray was the only boy from the club in the U- boysrsquo race, and while he found the going tough, hersquos learning by the week and I am confident that hersquoll develop into a top class runnerFirst points for ladiesEast Down ladies were much better represented than the men as they fielded a team of six and were more than pleased to place fth overall and to register their first place points of the current league campaign.The team scorers were Catherine OrsquoConnor , Niamh Kellett , Deirdre Weatheralland Clare Carsongiving a total of  points. Asto emphasise the importance of overtaking everyone possible, right to the very end, that total was matched by Acorns AC, but because their fourth scorer had finished higher than the East Down fourth-paced runner, Acorns get the better team position.In truth, the third-placed team had only six points less than either Acorns or EDAC, so with a few extra places it could so easily have been third place. But the EDAC squad are delighted with their achievement anyway. The other two participation point scorers were Janine Murray and Ella Carroll.Tough in LanzaroteRising star Gordy Graham headed for the sun in Lanzarote to make his latest marathon effort and with typical cussedness, the weather promptly stuck two fingers up at him by providing a strong headwind on the out and back course, the sting in the tail being that it was in the homeward half.

Jodi Foster and her sister Kari from Spa Primary School and Erin Moore from St Patrickrsquos Primary School, Saul, finished as the top  qualiers outside the qualying teams.Alex Robinson was not so fortunate for the boys and after a slow start, he could not find his way far enough through the traffic in a field of over  runners to take a qualying position.This weekend will see the EDAC Juniors on the road again as they travel to participate in the All-Ireland Uneven Age Group Cross-Country Championships at Navan Racecourse.The seniors have an equally dficult and y journey to participate in the North West Cross-Country in Gransha Park, Derry, but at least they only have to run k when they get there.To paraphrase an old First World War marching song: ldquoItrsquos a long trip to run in Derry.And itrsquos unique too in that everyone runs together, men, women, older men and women and junior men and women.

We just set about formalising a programme in earnest back in .ldquoOur programme works so well it is held up as a model for other schools across Northern Ireland to learn from and to embed its principles into their schools.Mr Moore says there is a fundamental dference between shared education and integration.ldquoThe main dference is that each school can hold on to their faith and culture but still be able to reach out in other aspects of the curriculum.ldquoOur parent teacher associations, for example, have been working together for some time. And on other levels we pull our resources too.Mr Moorersquos views were echoed by Mr Paul Coulter, his counterpart at St Patrickrsquos, who said the idea for shared education came from parents at both schools.Mr Coulter said that demand had grown over the years and that the schools were pulling their resources to fund shared experiences, such as educational trips.ldquoWhen you talk to the children you will see that they are really excited about coming together. Many strong friendships have been formed.Mrs Helen McEvoy, Shared Education co-ordinator at St Patrickrsquos, says the programme has given children the opportunity to come together and take part in learning together.She added: ldquoThe vision for the programme is to enhance the learning of all pupils in an environment where there is equal opportunity, good relations and mutual respect fostered, while at the same time acknowledging dferences and celebrating them.The Recorder met children from both schools last Thursday morning when they busy designing a new logo for their Shared Education Programme.Ten year-old Mya McCurry, who attends St Patrickrsquos Primary School, said she wasnrsquot able to see any dferences between pupils and teachers at both schools.ldquoWe started doing this programme when I was in P, she remarked. ldquoI am in P now. Itrsquos really fun and I look forward to having my friends from Ballynahinch Primary School coming here or visiting them at their school.ldquoTo be honest we were friends before we began getting together in school.

The images represented all that should not be about the GAA.ldquoPhysical violence has no place in our games or indeed at any level in our association. The fact that they might take place within the confines of GAA property is not excuse for acceptance of and turning a blind eye to such incidents.ldquoIf these incidents were happening on a public street after a Saturday night out they would be deemed to be assault and grievous bodily harm. They would lead to prosecutions and possible sentencing all of which can have a huge impact on the le of the victim and the transgressor.

Facts are that one punch could kill and that is in honesty something none of us would ever dare to dream of happening at a GAA game, but reality is that it could.

It is not just an Irish issue, it is very much a European issue as well.“It is very much a case of the European Union being one-for-all and all-for-one.”The backstop, which will come into effecta wider trade deal between the UK and EU fails to materialise, will see Northern Ireland adhere to a range of EU regulatory rules in order to facilitate free-flowing trade across the border.Prime Minister Theresa May is facing widespread opposition to the measure at Westminster amid claims it will undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom by creating an economic border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Varadkar said the issue could not be deferred to the trade talks post-withdrawal.“It’s not just an Irish issue, it’s a European issue,” he said.“It’s about protecting the peace, keeping the border open, also protecting the single market and making sure we answer this question of the Irish border now, so no side can use it as leverage in the future relationship talks, which we are willing to start as soon as the Withdrawal Agreement is ratied.”QC: Jonathan Bell sacriced political career over RHI and is now a social workerVillage’s ‘Bethlehem’ event proves a huge draw Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The Taoiseach said while the EU was willing to offer “clarications or explanations” to Mrs May, he reiterated that a renegotiation of the deal was not an option.try catch  TrendingPSNI issue warning to O customers seeking refund after network outageN.I. to see snow before Christmas - gale-force winds and heavy rain arriving this weekendO compensation package revealedNI farmer killed by bull: Health and Safety Executive investigatingIN PICTURES: Funeral of murder victim Jim Donegan          ..

but accepts that she got the date of a phone call mixed up, the inquiry has been told.In March, senior Ofgem official Teri Clton recalled how she had been phoned about an application and pressurised to accept it, even though there was evidence that it had not been processed due to an error by Action Renewables, a body paid by the application to complete the relevant paperwork, ahead of a cut in tarfs.Ian Paisley MPIn what was described as an “intimidating” situation, Ms Clton said that she was told that Mr Paisley, the applicant’s MP, was on the call.Several days later, Mr Paisley used Parliamentary privilege to demand that Sir Patrick Coghlin apologise to him for “putting words in the mouth of a witness” and went on to furiously allege that Ms Clton “lied” about him in her evidence.Yesterday the inquiry was told that Ms Clton accepts that the phone call took place several months later than she told the inquiry.However, counsel for the inquiry Joseph Aiken said that “Ms Clton essentially stands by her account as to the nature of the calls he received, who was said – as opposed to who was – to be on the other end of it and her reaction to it.Counsel for the inquiry Joseph Aiken speaking yesterday“She clearly cannot say that Ian Paisley Jr was on the call – only that as far as she is concerned she was told that he was.”He said that a note by Action Renewables the following day indicates that Mr Paisley was not on the call and the applicants, who were on the call, say that Mr Paisley was not present.He said: “Ultimately, the matter is of limited relevance to the inquiry” but was “one of a multitude of issues” before it. Referring to Mr Paisley’s accusation of “lying”, Mr Aiken said: “It will be a matter for the inquiry , but you may consider that the material that I’m laying out before you today may suggest that an allegation of lying against the official who gave the evidence to you was unjustied in the circumstances.”Gales and heavy rain to pound N.I. - Met Office issue severe weather warningSerious assault: Five people arrested are released on bail Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingPSNI issue warning to O customers seeking refund after network outageN.I. to see snow before Christmas - gale-force winds and heavy rain arriving this weekendO compensation package revealedNI farmer killed by bull: Health and Safety Executive investigatingIN PICTURES: Funeral of murder victim Jim Donegan          ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is for two related reasons.ldquoThe first is that itrsquos impossible to justy the use of taxpayersrsquo money on such far-flung conflicts where their impact or relevance to the UK is all but impossible to identy.ldquoThe second is that whenever we take on such broad and ambitious tasks, our track record is poor and we risk doing more harm than good.She pointed to criticism of the UKrsquos Conflict, Stability and Security Fund, adding: ldquoI wonrsquot go into depth on the aid budget more generally ndash suffice to say that when we are paying pound billion a year in interest servicing our national debt, spending pound billion a year on ill-thought-out and poorly executed aid policy in the name of an arbitrary spending target I find unjustiable.Baroness Brady called for more investment in the armed forces Lady Brady outlined how the UK should seek to ldquosecure the peace in conflict zones, adding: ldquoItrsquos not about building infrastructure or supporting a path to democracy ndash although this needs to happen ndash it is simply about ending the violence once and for all.She said this was better done through defence work than international development, noting: ldquoTake Iraq, it was exactly the failure to secure the peace that meant that it couldnrsquot flourish as a country.ldquoNo amount of aid money can change the reality when bombs targeting civilians are part of every day le. Prosperity will never come.Lady Brady said this was about protecting civilians so they could resume their lives, arguing the rule of law and associated institutions would begin to be established.She went on: ldquoSo where are the key opportunities to bring about peace ldquoThe UK Government should therefore act, of course, but I think itrsquos our armed forces we should look at, not the aid budget.ldquoOnce peace is secure, multilateral development banks, infrastructure investors, NGOs, experts in building institutions can manage and eventually create the conditions for private sector investors.Lady Brady said the question was not about re-purposing defence spending to hit the .% aid target, adding: ldquoThe .% aid budget should be re-purposed to help us deliver our % defence spending commitment under Nato.ldquoIt may not burnish our so-called soft power credentials as much but it would be much more effective in the long run ndash for us, for the conflict zones in question and surely that is more important..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Karren Brady condemns  uunjustiable u aid spending on  ufar-flung conflicts u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before. This opportunity needs to be taken.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cd_1.jpg","title":"it and the city deal","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew looks at what major IT elements Belfast and the surrounding regions could get out of a potential £bn City Deal When it was formally announced that the Government would put forward £m from the Treasury towards a finance pot worth up to £bn for six councils as part of a new City Deal, it’s obvious that IT, innovation and manufacturing technologies would be high on the list. The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
