That hurts,’ he said.The Duke added of the Press: ‘Unfortunately, if the source of information is inherently corrupt or racist or biased then that filters out to the rest of society.’In an extra clip that did not make the final two-hour cut, Oprah asks Harry if they left the UK because of racism to which he replied: ‘It was a large part of it.’In more additional footage, Meghan said her treatment in the Press had been worse than Kate’s, saying: ‘If a member of his family would comfortably say “we’ve all had to deal with things that are rude”, rude and racist are not the same.’   Royal warfare erupted after Harry and Meghan revealed deeply private and confidential conversations with the royal family to a US journalist friend after they appeared on Oprah, despite claiming it would be their \u0027final word\u0027 on their rift with the royals.The couple told breakfast show host Gayle King the prince had finally spoken to his father and brother - and she went on a major TV network to disclose that the talks ‘were not productive’.Miss King also suggested that Meghan was unhappy that no-one in the Royal Family had picked up the phone to her yet following their explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey.And in a thinly-veiled threat, the broadcaster said Meghan had made clear she has ‘documents to back up everything she said on Oprah’s interview’.The fact that the couple chose to discuss such sensitive discussions between senior members of the royal family with a TV journalist, who broadcast them blow-by-blow within hours, met with an icy response from Buckingham Palace. Prince William has insisted that the Royal Family were not racists after Meghan claimed one of them had raised ‘concerns’ about ‘how dark’ her baby’s skin would be, and suggested that they tried to deprive Archie of a title and security because he was of mixed race.She also claimed she had been given so little support by the palace that she suffered suicidal thoughts.For his part, Harry said he felt ‘really let down’ by his father, accused him of cutting him off financially and refusing to take his calls, while revealing there was a gulf between himself and William. In recent days there have been a handful of stories published in the UK reporting that Charles and William felt hurt by what Harry had said, but with very little detail on what was taking place behind the scenes.That was turned on its head when Miss King, who attended Meghan’s lavish baby shower in New York in 2019 and is Miss Winfrey’s closest friend, decided to speak out on her prime time morning show on CBS, the same channel that broadcast the Sussexes’ interview.Harry was accused of ‘embarrassing’ hypocrisy this week for speaking to CBS, which caused outrage in 2004 by showing a photograph of his mother dying in a 1997 car crash in Paris.Miss King told viewers she had called Harry and Meghan at their £10 million California home ‘over the weekend’ to discuss the fall-out from the interview and revealed that they had told her details of their intimate conversations.She said: ‘Well I’m not trying to break news, but I did actually call them to see how they were feeling, and it’s true, Harry has talked to his brother and he has talked to his father too.‘The word I was given was that those conversations were not productive. But they are glad that they have at least started a conversation.’Miss King also claimed that the couple were unhappy that ‘the palace’ had apparently been leaking what they believed were untrue stories to the media, adding: ‘And I think what is still upsetting to them is the palace keep saying they want to work it out privately, but yet, they believe these false stories are coming out that are very disparaging against Meghan, still.’She made clear that the Duchess was unhappy that no-one in the family had called her, despite her making a string of highly inflammatory allegations against several of them in her interview and revealing details of what had been a private conversation between her husband and a family member in which it was alleged an offensive comment had been made.‘No one in the Royal Family has talked to Meghan yet, at this particular time,’ she said.The Sussexes effectively accused the Royal Family and Buckingham Palace of institutional racism in their interview with Miss Winfrey.But Miss King claimed they felt ‘frustrated’ that much of the coverage had focused on this - when they had apparently only wanted to provoke the monarchy into taking action against the media, which they believe has a racist agenda against Meghan.‘I think it’s frustrating for them to see that it’s a racial conversation about the Royal Family when all they wanted all along was for the royals to intervene and tell the Press to stop with the unfair, inaccurate, false stories that definitely have a racial slant,’ Miss King said.‘And until you can acknowledge that, I think it’s going to be hard to move forward. But they both want to move forward with this and they both want healing in this family. At the end of the day, that is Harry’s family.’The broadcaster also raised the investigation launched earlier this month by Buckingham Palace into how claims of bullying against Meghan lodged by a senior member of palace staff were handled.Her former communications secretary, Jason Knauf, complained in 2018 that she had driven out two PAs with her behaviour and was targeting other female members of staff, but nothing was apparently ever done in response to his allegations.Miss King says: ‘The bullying thing was raised in 2018 and now there’s an ongoing investigation about bullying from Meghan Markle, when anyone who has worked with her will tell you exactly who she is. You know, she’s really a very sweet, caring person.’She added: ‘And as I say, Meghan has documents to back up everything that she said on Oprah’s interview. Everything.’In a further discussion about the ongoing family strife and how to resolve it, Miss King seemed to suggest that Harry and Meghan were not satisfied by Buckingham Palace’s response to their bombshell interview and the claims in it.She said: ‘The family has to acknowledge that there are issues. And right now, no-one has acknowledged, “Houston, we have a problem here”. That’s really all they want. They want a conversation. They both want a conversation.’There was no immediate reaction from the Sussexes’s team of PR people - either in London or California - about whether Miss King was speaking at their request.But as one of their closest friends and media allies in the US, it is unthinkable, say insiders, that they would not have at least been aware that she may choose to brief it.Royals aides appeared to be genuinely horrified that either the duke or duchess would personally choose to tell anyone, let alone a television journalist, about intimate and highly confidential conversations that Harry was having with his closest family.They fail to see how it will go any way towards repairing their damaged relationships or rebuilding the family’s shattered trust - on either side.One said: ‘The only positive we can take out of this is that at least they are talking. It would be better from now on, however, if that could be done in private space.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Countryside Code updated time decade tell visitors behave","story":"Share this article Natural England chairman Tony Juniper said: \u0027The Countryside Code has been providing an excellent guide for people on how to get out and enjoy the outdoors safely for over 70 years. \u0027With more people than ever before seeking solace in nature, this refresh could not come at a more crucial time. \u0027We want everyone to be aware of the Code, so people of all ages and backgrounds can enjoy the invaluable health and wellbeing benefits that nature offers, while giving it the respect it deserves.\u0027 Rural affairs minister Lord Gardiner said: \u0027With so many people visiting the countryside, the Countryside Code has never felt more relevant. \u0027Crucially it now covers all green spaces, waterways, the coast and even parks in towns and cities, so that everyone, as we lift restrictions, can enjoy a greener future.\u0027 Mark Bridgeman, president of the Country Land and Business Association (CLA), which represents 28,000 rural businesses owners across England and Wales, said: \u0027With more people expected to explore rural areas over Easter it\u0027s imperative that the Code is well-read, respected and followed. \u0027Although there have not been significant changes to the Code, the messaging is clear - Respect, Protect and Enjoy the outdoors. \u0027By closing gates behind you and sticking to footpaths, to keeping your dog under control and picking up rubbish, there is no reason why we cannot work together to keep the countryside beautiful for everyone to enjoy.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Key witness George Floyd trial car refuses testify","story":"Share this articleWitness Who Was in George Floyd¿s Car, Maurice Lester Hall, Says His Friend Did Not Resist Arrest - The New York Times"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a22f29163d1519afc7b36ae0cef689d06a59d7a8/357_3459_3514_2108/master/3514.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8c6196cc793704af5c41e6a30d6e8a57","title":"practise mindfulness and five other morning rituals to improve your focus","story":"Arrange a healthy breakfastGetting the right nutrients in your body first thing in the morning is hugely beneficial when it comes to maintaining focus throughout the day. Sheena Skinner, founder of wellness company Detox Health Beauty, swears by options such as porridge with almond butter and chopped banana, or granola with berries and almond or oat milk. “Eating a wide variety of wholegrains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and legumes throughout the day ensures that blood sugar levels are stable and provides the brain with healthy fats, carbohydrates, protein, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals,” she says. “These all work synergistically to promote brain health, focus, memory, concentration, and health in general.” Add an easy-to-achieve goal to your to-do listAccording to Psychology Today, you can manipulate your dopamine levels by setting small goals: “The satisfaction of ticking off a small task is linked with a flood of dopamine. Each time your brain gets a whiff of this rewarding neurotransmitter, it will want you to repeat the associated behaviour.” Train your brainCrosswords and other puzzles are a handy way to pass the time, but they’re also incredibly useful in improving memory and brain function. Dr Gareth Moore, puzzle author, writes in The : “Your brain loves this mental pat on the back, and it can help make life’s larger problems somehow seem easier to tackle. What’s more, those little bursts of joy at finishing a puzzle can help calm your mind, in much the same way that physical exercise can mentally relax you too.” Practise mindfulness and meditationIncorporating simple mindfulness or meditation techniques into your routine will work wonders in lowering stress levels. If you’re unsure where to begin, apps such as Calm and Headspace – which have hundreds of guided meditation practices – are a valuable resource. “Using Calm in the morning allows you to take dedicated time to observe what’s going on with your thoughts and emotions that would otherwise go unnoticed,” Jade Heritage, mindfulness practitioner at Calm, says. “The Daily Calm and Daily Trip – Calm’s two, 10-minute daily meditation offerings – are great tools for beginners or advanced meditators alike to focus on their inner selves and bring mindfulness into the rest of the day. By gaining awareness and not slipping into ‘autopilot’ in your morning routine, you are better able to take care of your needs throughout the day.” Enjoy natureComprehensive and dedicated science exists on the positive mental effects of venturing outdoors and spending time in nature. A study from Stanford University, for example, found that participants who walked through the leafier parts of California experienced a decrease in anxiety and rumination – both of which can negatively affect focus – compared with participants who walked through more urbanised areas. Heading out into nature in the morning, then, could benefit your concentration. If you simply can’t escape the traffic, Halina Rifai, who produces the thought-provoking mental health podcast A Sonic Hug, suggests listening to a podcast: “I can lose myself in them and enjoy my time outdoors.” She says. “It prevents my own overthinking.” Get it all down on paperAnxiety and stress can hamper our ability to stay focused. But according to American psychotherapist and author Barbara Markway, keeping a record of your thoughts on paper is “one of the most useful things you can do to combat stress and anxiety”.

The total volume of retail sales has, however, recovered close to pre-pandemic levels, after falling by the most on record during the first wave. With pubs and restaurants closed and people spending less on services during lockdown, supermarket sales have surged, while DIY and gardening spending rose sharply as people spent more time at home. Clothing sales on the other hand have fallen and many physical shops in town and city centres have been pushed to the brink of collapse as their doors remained closed. More than 11,000 outlets permanently disappeared from high streets last year. As well as having one of the highest coronavirus death rates in the world, the UK economy suffered the worst performance among the G7 group of wealthy nations last year, as the government entered lockdown later than other countries and then took longer to relax restrictions. Only Spain suffered a sharper decline among EU countries. The structure of the UK economy, with a greater dependence on social consumption – face-to-face spending in restaurants and shops – was among factors contributing to the bigger decline. The Treasury has also argued that other countries use a different approach to calculating GDP, resulting in lower figures for the UK. However, economists believe this does not fully account for the UK’s underperformance. More than 150,000 people have died from coronavirus in the UK, according to  analysis, far exceeding the worst expectations from a year ago. This is the highest rate of deaths from infectious and parasitic disease since 1918 during the Spanish flu, the last big pandemic to strike. New daily coronavirus cases peaked at more than 80,000 in the winter second wave – more than 15 times the peak recorded in the first wave – before gradually falling this spring. More than 30 million people have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine, more than half the adult population and one of the highest rates in the world. Global financial markets were plunged into turmoil last spring as the Covid pandemic brought western capitalism to its knees. Big landmark moves that typically take years to reach fell like dominos in a matter of hours and days, with the FTSE 100 suffering its worst day since Black Monday in 1987. On Wall Street, the pace of decline of the Dow Jones outstripped the speed of the 1929 Wall Street crash. Global central banks cut interest rates close to zero and pumped billions into the financial system using quantitative easing to restore confidence, stabilising the situation. Since then, several big indices have rallied to fresh record highs. Shares in big US tech firms have soared as the pandemic pushes more activity online, boosting the fortunes of the world’s richest billionaires. However, the FTSE 100 remains about 1,000 points below its pre-pandemic peak. Faltering demand for goods and services during the pandemic has depressed the rate of inflation, with the consumer prices index (CPI) falling close to zero as energy costs dropped and many firms cut their prices to entice reluctant buyers. Reflecting the collapse in demand, US oil prices turned negative for the first time in history. With record support from governments and global central banks, economists expect inflation to rise as consumers go on a spending spree after lockdown measures are relaxed. Unlike previous recessions, when house prices typically track declines in economic activity, the Covid crash has been accompanied by a boom in property values. The government’s stamp duty holiday has fuelled growth, as well as people reassessing where they live during lockdown and moving – looking for more space, or a home away from big city centres. The housing market is also supported by more affluent households able to save during the crisis while working from home. Meanwhile, lower-income workers have fallen behind on rent. Property industry experts have warned prices could fall after the tax break ends and as unemployment rises.

Markit’s UK manufacturing PMI has jumped to a decade-high of 58.9 in March, the highest reading since February 2011.  That signals a sharp expansion last month, as vaccine rollouts at home and abroad boost confidence, and the loosening of lockdown restrictions approaches. Purchasing managers told Markit that they had seen stronger order growth, from both domestic customers and overseas, alongside a jump in output. Encouragingly, business optimism hit a seven-year high, as did employment growth. But (as in the eurozone) the sector remained beset by severe supplychain and logistic issues, however, leading to delivery delays from suppliers and disruption to production and distribution schedules. But.. he also warns the blockage in the Suez Canal could intensify supply chain disruption, and drive the cost of supplies even higher. That’s according to Data firm IHS Markit, which says that the eurozone’s manufacturing economy performed extremely strongly during March.  Its monrhly healthcheck found the biggest improvement in operating conditions in nearly 24 years of data collection. Purchasing managers at factories across the euro area reported record increases in output, new orders, exports and purchasing activity last month. This drove Markit’s eurozone PMI up to 62.5, up from February’s 57.9 , a level that shows rapid growth (50  stagnation). It’s the highest reading since the survey began in June 1997. Germany and the Netherlands’ factory sectors both recorded their highest ever PMI levels in March, with Austria, Italy and France also seeing rapid growth. But...unprecedented supply-side delays drove the sharpest rise in input costs for a decade, and the longest delays for raw materials in the survey’s history. Here’s the details: Yesterday, Associated British Foods said its Primark fashion chain had paused new orders in Myanmar, where hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators have been killed at protests against the ruling junta which seized power in February. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, says Next has shown its financial resilience in the last year: The latest lockdown is accelerating this shift online, with Next’s stores currently closed. In his review of the year (lengthy, but worth a read), Wolfson predicts that like-for-like stores sales could fall by a fifth this year, leaving them ‘marginally profitable’. That might concern Next’s landlords, point out the FT’s Jonathan Eley: As the company points out: So how did it still manage £342m of pre-tax profits, despite the impact of Covid-19?  According to CEO Lord Simon Wolfson, there were four main reasons: Online Scale: Going into the pandemic, online sales (including finance) accounted for more than half of the Group’s turnover, giving it the scale to pick up lost high-street business. Product Diversity: Where Next lost sales on smart clothes, it won them in the leisure aisles. It says: Financial strength: A reslient balance sheet, strong cash resources and “the quality of our customer receivables” meant Next didn’t draw on emergency Government lending. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverge of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After an unprecedented year of disruption, UK fashion and homeware retailer Next has seen its profits halve. But it’s also boosting its earnings forecast for this year, after strong e-commerce sales in recent weeks. Next, which runs retail outlets and sells online, reported this morning that annual pretax profits fell to £342m in the 12 months to January. That’s down from £729m in the previous year, just before the coronavirus pandemic struck. Rooney adds that Next expects the shift in consumer behaviour towards Online sales to continue for some time - so the company has been investing heavily in its web platform.  And significantly, Next is also raising its profit guidance for this year, by £30m, after seeing a strong start to the year. In its latest guidance to the City, Next says: Here’s some early reaction from the Times’s Ashley Armstrong... ..and the ’s Laura Onita. Concerns about treatment of workers, and its path to profitability once the pandemic ends, weighed on Deliveroo (swiftly dubbed ‘Deliveroops’ by Twitter wags). But more broadly, investors seem to be in a positive mood ahead of the Easter break, with president Joe Biden’s plans for a huge new infrastructure programme boosting spirits.  We get manufacturing reports from the UK and across the eurozone this morning, and later from the US, which will probably also that activity strengthened this month. Overnight, PMI reports from Japan and South Korea have shown that factory activity expanded in March thanks to solid demand at home and abroad -- a good sign for the global recovery. "},{"url":null,"title":"covid lockdown small talk lockdown socialise","story":"Now, I’m not saying the pandemic has turned the entire global population into Kaspar Hausers speaking in monosyllables and rehearsed phrases, and hissing at sunlight. My English is still pretty good and, thanks to the spare-time glut, I’ve even improved my French. At the same time, as lockdown eases, the idea of having to hold a conversation with someone other than my partner or the select few people I regularly video call, fills me with both excitement and dread. Even before my year without a social life, I was prone to social anxiety. Parties – if I remember rightly – left me feeling like I’d just tried to schlep a mattress up a hill. Now, I feel like I need to take a nap after exchanging small talk with a delivery person. Small talk, in fact, is becoming more and more of an olden-days skill, like butter churning or identifying witches. Is there any room for chitchat about the weather when the entire world has just experienced the same traumatic event? It feels a little bit like wiping your feet before entering a pigsty. And – these days – being asked how I am sends me into an existential spiral. The reflex to answer, “Good, yeah, fine”, comes into conflict with a universally acknowledged reality that everything has been extremely difficult, and we’re all processing varying levels of trauma. So I usually answer with something along the lines of, “Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,” until the person intent on knowing how I am changes the subject. I’m not sure Kaspar Hauser would have known how to deal with small talk either. How do you exchange banal niceties when your only point of reference is a windowless room, your own meandering thoughts and – intermittently – the miraculous appearance of bread and water through a hatch to a world you cannot begin to comprehend? Or (much less extreme, but still …) an entire year spent enacting minor variations on the same non-social activities, and – intermittently – the not so miraculous appearance of a prime minister, to lie about how much longer all this is going to last. So, if we’re going to set one ground rule for the “back to normal” transition period it should be this: do not, under any circumstances, ask anyone how they’ve been. We’re entering a post-small talk society. One in which casual phrases of greeting such as “How’s it going?” or “How have you been?” need to be replaced with “What was your first encounter with death?” or, “When’s the last time you screamed, and why?”. In the unlikely event that anyone would like to talk about how they’ve been, or what they’ve been up to, it’s probably better that they offer up that information themselves, unprompted. Otherwise, there needs to be an unspoken understanding that everyone is doing “terribly” and has been up to “not much”. It’s even possible that, one day, small talk will make sense again. And, when it does, we’ll slip – without any real thought – back into answering, “Good, yeah, fine” when asked how we are. But, until whenever that may be, let’s just accept that everyone we know has gone a little bit Kaspar Hauser. To varying degrees, we’ve all forgotten how to exist in a world where it’s OK to kiss our relatives, or rub the corner of your eye without first washing your hands for the duration of the birthday song. The other day, I asked my partner what we did on weekends, pre-Covid. I genuinely couldn’t remember where we’d go, who we’d see, and how long we’d stay out. She listed a number of people, places, and activities. I thought for a while, before responding, “Horse! Horse!” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4143143672646c921a45d6ae087f697e70f4cb48/0_91_1839_1103/master/1839.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=5917f92f5a7776786f9b61fd3dac883b","title":"from diy kits to sustainable bespoke furniture meet the businesses reshaping interior design","story":"Given this, the digital video meetings we’ve all become used to can only take a designer so far. Nonetheless, the sector itself is proving resilient eight out of 10 people, according to a survey conducted by the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) in October, wanted to change their homes as soon as it was safe to do so. “The impact of Covid-19 will affect how and where we choose to live for years to come,” says Riba president Alan Jones. “For many of us, our homes are our sanctuaries, and this research indicates that many people are keener than ever to adapt and improve their homes.” Many interior designers across the UK report an increase in the number of new clients they have taken on. But as the process relies so heavily on being physically present in a space, they have had to adapt. Zoe Hewett is no stranger to finding creative ways around problems. When she first started her interior design business, Stylemongers of Bristol, the former set designer for theatre and TV productions lacked the funds to make over her own home to serve as a showcase – so instead she built a doll’s house to demonstrate her style. As a result of the pandemic, Hewett scaled back her face-to-face work, but has still found ways of expanding her business – one of which is a range of interior design kits to help people design their own homes. “At first, I was thinking about making my services accessible,” she says. “A one-to-one design consultation is worth doing for a bespoke service, but it’s always going to be out of reach for some people, so I wanted to offer something affordable, at a price point more people could afford.” The pandemic meant the project became a priority for her business, and the packs became a reality. “I may have created an envelope-stuffing role for myself,” she says. “But I love that people are getting something physical and tangible to work with.” The packs are made of recycled card and paper and are delivered in letterbox-sized packages. Hewett sees them as a way of sharing the information and techniques that she previously discussed in face-to-face workshops, where she would guide groups through the principles of interior design – from creating moodboards to where to place furniture. They contain, among other things, quizzes to help buyers explore design choices, advice on using colour and materials to create 2D-scale layouts of rooms, plus a link to an ebook with further information. Hewett says the take-up of the £50 kits has been “pretty good. I hope people find them fun as well as useful. One lady who bought one said she’s using it again with her seven-year-old to reimagine their shed. Her daughter’s got really into it, apparently.” From each commission, Hewett makes a donation to the homeless charity Crisis. “Creating nice places is what drives me,” she says. “So it makes sense to me to also help people who haven’t got anywhere to live yet.” The community focus is also important to Liselle Milner of Zenterior Design, based in St Austell, Cornwall. She works with 12 others, including builders, carpenters and upholsterers, to create indoor and outdoor spaces and bespoke furniture, all with a focus on using sustainable materials. Much of her work involves second homes or holiday lets, so the owners have not been able to travel to meet her. “We’ve always focused on the relationship with the client, getting an idea of exactly what it is they want and then making that happen, so to never meet someone face-to-face has been very odd,” she says. “Although, if you are talking to someone via Zoom, there is the advantage of seeing their house in the background, so it’s a very quick way of seeing what they already like.” Milner uses a lot of secondhand or upcycled furniture – “I want the space to look as amazing as possible for the budget we have” – but her pre-pandemic visits to charity shops and auctions have been replaced by Facebook Marketplace, and ever-greater resourcefulness as a team. “We’re looking at things we would usually outsource, like quilting, for example, and thinking: ‘Can we do that ourselves?’” she says. “It’s good creatively, and it also means we can keep to a schedule. Big furniture retailers have set specifics they work to. If a piece is made of oak, and if the oak isn’t there, then that sofa won’t be with you in 12 weeks’ time. But if we are making it, then we can use beech or another suitable wood that we can actually get hold of.” Besides changing their ways of working to comply with pandemic-related restrictions, such as visiting sites inidually instead of together, the Zenterior team have also adapted some of the other physical parts of their jobs, finding ways to keep to social distancing rules, and have stopped working on occupied domestic properties. Milner has also doubled down on Zenterior’s commitment to using local suppliers, not only to avoid delays with supply chains but also from a sense of local responsibility, as the regional tourism sector has been hit especially hard by restrictions on movement. “And there’s also the fact that Cornwall has always been a hub for artists and creative people. It makes sense to work with people who are here,” says Milner. The pandemic may have affected their traditional ways of working for now, but both Milner and Hewett are determined that its lasting effects on our homes are sustainably positive.

The Corsair study includes responses from 53,880 participants across the UK, with about 2,000 participants in each of the 37 stages of the study conducted between 2 March 2020 and 27 January 2021. Some participants took part in more than one stage of the survey.

Experts said the differences between the ONS and Corsair studies could have a number of explanations, including that the ONS study was based on responses of those within the test-and-trace system. “You can expect that the subset of people who have Covid and who also request a test and provide their details are more compliant than the overall population who have Covid,” said Prof Susan Michie, a co-author of the study who is a participant in the behavioural science subgroup of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and a member of the Independent Sage group of experts. By contrast, the Corsair study is based on sampling of the general population by an anonymous online market research company, something Michie said may also reduce concerns among respondents of saying they had broken the rules, compared with being phoned by the ONS, part of a government department. “The good news is that rates of adherence have been improving,” said James Rubin, an author on the paper and a professor of psychology of emerging health risks at King’s College London. But there is more work to be done, he said. “We need to get more people to engage with the system, to recognise the symptoms, to get a test, and then to self-isolate and follow it through,” Rubin said. “We need to be getting people into the mindset of as soon as you’ve got one of these symptoms coming on, get a test. Don’t leave it a few days. Don’t wait until it resolves. “What we don’t want is people who have got Covid out in the community, having contact with other people, spreading the infection. The more people with positive tests who self-isolate, the quicker we can get out of the restrictions we are currently in.”  A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Since last May, NHS test and trace has contacted 3.2 million people who tested positive, and another 6.4 million of their contacts. Behind these numbers are countless lives saved and the latest ONS statistics show that when people are asked to self-isolate, the overwhelming majority do so. “It is vital that people continue to do their bit by isolating when they are asked to. As the prevalence of coronavirus falls, our testing-and-tracing system becomes more important in identifying and suppressing local outbreaks while also responding rapidly to the threat of new variants.”"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Variability of Irish weather continues to pose late blight risks"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been almost a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 2.5\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.NEWS AND UPDATES: - How many have been vaccinated here?Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 225,684 had received their second dose.Some 184,252 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 326,536 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 274,195 had gone to people over the age of 70. Some\u0026nbsp21,269 people in Cohort 4 - those\u0026nbspaged between 16 and 69 at very high risk of severe Covid-19 disease - received a dose.\u0026nbspGlobally, over 500 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 5.4 million doses by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc. While talks continue on how to increase production, the company has now committed to a total of 40 million doses for the EU in the first quarter of 2021.While the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab, resulting in a significant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.On March 11th Norwegian health authorities said three health workers in Norway who had recently received the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine were being treated in hospital for bleeding, blood clots and a low count of blood platelets.Norway halted the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine, following a similar move by Denmark. Iceland later followed suit.On Thursday, March 18th, the EMA announced it had found\u0026nbspno causal link between the vaccine and blood-clotting events and use of the vaccine\u0026nbspresumed on Saturday March 20th in Ireland.How many will Ireland get? 190,000 doses in February and a further 95,000 in early March - supply after this is not confirmed.Storage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.On March 30th, the Cabinet agreed to change the National Vaccination Programme to an age-based system, once those aged 70 years and older, people considered vulnerable and those with underlying conditions are immunised. The original programme involved 15 cohorts of people based on age and profession, with key workers prioritised.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket began to receive their first dose on March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4525509.1617228405!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"all employees set to have right to disconnect from work from today","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Tánaiste Leo Varadkar is also to invite submissions on his plans to put the right of employees to seek remote working into law.  Photograph:  Julien Behal Photography PA Wire All employees will from Thursday have the right to disconnect from work and have better work-life balance under a new official code of practice, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise and Employment Leo Varadkar has said.He said the right to disconnect would give employees the entitlement to “switch off” from their jobs outside of normal working hours, including not having to respond immediately to emails, telephone calls or other messages.Mr Varadkar will on Thursday sign the new code of practice on the right to disconnect which has been drawn up by the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).Separately on Thursday the Tánaiste is also to invite submissions on his plans to put the right of employees to seek remote working into law.The Department of Enterprise and Employment said both initiatives formed part of Mr Varadkar’s overall plan “to create more flexible family-friendly working arrangements, including working from home and working more flexible hours”.The new code of practice includes:* The right of an employee to not have to routinely perform work outside their normal working hours.* The right not to be penalised for refusing to attend to work matters outside of normal working hours.* The duty to respect another person’s right to disconnect (for example, by not routinely emailing or calling outside normal working hours).The new code says that while not following its provisions does not in itself constitute an offence under the Workplace Relations Act 2015, the same legislation maintains that in any proceedings before a court, the Labour Court or the WRC, a code of practice shall be admissible in evidence. It says “any provision of the code which appears to the court, body or officer concerned to be relevant to any question arising in the proceedings shall be taken into account in determining that question”.Mr Varadkar said: “The code of practice comes into effect immediately and applies to all types of employment, whether you are working remotely or not. It will help employees, no matter what their job is, to strike a better work-life balance and switch off from work outside of their normal working hours.” Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4520165.1616687940!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"british government guidance on union flag reignites ni debate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLoyalist protesters converge on Belfast City Hall in 2013 over removal of the union flag from the the building. File photograph: PAThe British government’s latest guidance on flying of the union flag in England, Scotland and Wales has prompted unionist politicians to call for the standard to be flown year round on government buildings in Northern Ireland.Unionists also have linked the flags issue to the Northern Ireland protocol. This has led to an Irish Sea border and the disruption of trade from Britain to the North.On Wednesday the British government called on all local councils to fly the union flag on civic buildings as a sign of British national identity. This was part of an initiative to promote the union of Britain and Northern Ireland.The guidance, however, does not apply to Northern Ireland where the union flag flies over government buildings on about 20 designated days annually.At the end of 2012 and through 2013 Northern Ireland and Belfast in particular was subjected to serious loyalist violence, protests and business disruption after Belfast City Council voted that the flag should fly over city hall on the designated days and not all-year round.DUP Lagan Valley MP Jeffrey Donaldson said on Thursday that flying the ensign 365 days a year over British government buildings should be extended to Northern Ireland.“Many will see it as bizarre that the UK government is only deciding in 2021 to fly the union flag, the flag of our nation, on all government buildings every day. When I visit other nations around the world, flying the national flag on government buildings is commonplace,” he said.Mr Donaldson added that if the British government “wanted to immediately improve the union they would start with the removal of the protocol”.The Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) party also called for the flag to fly every day over government buildings.Meanwhile unionists, as they had threatened, launched a legal action aimed at scrapping the protocol. They also started a crowdfunding appeal to help pay for the actionwhich is being taken by a coalition of pro-union politicians such as DUP leader and First Minister Arlene Foster, former Ulster Unionist first minister David (Lord) Trimble and former Labour MP Kate (Baroness) Hoey.Ms Foster said the DUP would work with other unionists to send a “united message to our government and to free Northern Ireland from the protocol. We cannot allow our United Kingdom to be ripped apart and our UK internal market to be ided in order to protect the single market of the EU.”Lord Trimble said he joined in the action “because Northern Ireland’s place as an integral part of the United Kingdom is at stake. Extensive parts of Northern Ireland – much of its economic fabric – have been turned into a colony of the European Union. ”UUP leader Steve Aiken said the “protocol fundamentally undermines the integrity of the United Kingdom, the Belfast Agreement and the principle of consent”.TUV leader Jim Allister said the “protocol annexes Northern Ireland into the EU, leaving us subject to laws we did not make and cannot change”.Baroness Hoey said she was “not prepared to allow those living in Northern Ireland to be treated as second-class citizens of our own country – the UK”.Former Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib said the UK was “the only country in history to have voluntarily partitioned itself. We must not rest until the protocol is ended. It is vital that all pro-unionists join together in this fight.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4526093.1617269821!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what to see in the sky in april venus and mercury to meet in a conjunction","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe name Sirius comes from the Greek “sparkling” or “scorching” and its brilliance does catch the eye, while another old designation translates as “of a thousand colours”. On April 12th, 1961 – sixty years ago this month – we fulfilled a dream we had for millennia as Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space.Less than 600 people have made the trip into orbit since that time, yet spaceflight nowadays does not garner headlines like the early missions. Trips are expected to become even more routine in the next decade as commercial ventures like Blue Origins and Virgin Galactic offer sub-orbital flights to the public.For those of us earthbound though, we can journey far beyond our local confines each clear night just by looking up.Following Orion as he slips towards the southwestern skyline these evenings are his faithful canine companions. The constellation of the lesser dog (Canis Minor) has only the prominent star Procyon but the greater dog (Canis Major) hots Sirius, the brightest diamond in the sky.The name Sirius comes from the Greek “sparkling” or “scorching” and its brilliance does catch the eye, while another old designation translates as “of a thousand colours”.That is a very apt description as Sirius never gets very high from Ireland’s latitude and shows a range of hues. The kaleidoscope effect is due to different wavelengths of the star’s light being smeared out as it passes through a denser mass of atmosphere when we see it low down.All stars twinkle – or scintillate – to some extent, but the effect is dramatic with Sirius. The upshot is that starlight is scattered and recombined in a haphazard way while passing through our turbulent atmosphere before reaching telescopes and detectors. Astronomers living at the bottom of that ocean of air therefore need to somehow sharpen the view.Professional observatories do have a trick up their sleeve and that is by using adaptive optics. The technique employs actuators mounted behind the mirrors of giant telescopes to rapidly flex their surface and compensate for atmospheric blurring. It allows us get images from the ground almost as good as those returned by observatories in orbit.The diamond-like sparkling of Sirius is worth admiring though. Its rainbow colours are beautifully enhanced when you defocus your binoculars slightly while viewing the star and especially so when Sirius is just after rising or nears setting.Sirius is also bright because it is nearby. The star lies 8.6 light years away and is about twice the mass of our sun and a little more than three times its diameter.Canis MajorOther stars in Canis Major would blaze brighter than Sirius if they were as close but the constellation’s lucida has no compare at present in our sky for apparent brightness. You need to go back about 90,000 years to find a star that outshone Sirius, and fast-forward more than 200,000 years for when it will be demoted as top dog.Huddled in the glare of Sirius is a companion aptly nicknamed the Pup. The star is a white dwarf only as big as the Earth, yet a teaspoonful of its material weighs as much as a family car. White dwarves are the corpses of stars that have evolved past old age and puffed off most of their material to expose the underlying core.Sirius was important to some early civilisations as its first appearance in the morning sky before sunrise - what we call its helical rising - coincided with the annual flooding of the Nile river in ancient Egypt. This was a crucial time as when the flood waters receded, they left behind fertile soil.The stifling heat around the beginning of August in ancient Rome led to that time of year becoming known as the dies caniculares (days of the dog). Sirius was then above the horizon during daylight hours, so it was believed the star’s heat was added to that of the Sun to give a run of scorching temperatures. The interval from early July to mid-August of Dante’s “great scourge of canicular days” is still referred to as the dog days of summer in modern times.The Moon this monthEaster Sunday this year is on April 4th. That moveable feast is generally the first Sunday following the first full moon after the spring equinox. The actual calculation of Easter is slightly more intricate, but the aide-mémoire is effective.The last quarter moon on April 4th coincides with Easter Sunday, while the new moon is on April 12th, and first quarter on the 20th. The full moon on the 27th is classed as a supermoon but next month’s full moon is the closest of the year.The planets this monthMercury swiftly emerges from the solar glare towards the end of April to become visible in our evening sky. The planet does not set until more than an hour after the Sun at the end of the month.The innermost planet can be found a little below the Pleiades star cluster on the evening of April 30th. Scan the west-northwest skyline with binoculars after 9.30pm and you should catch Mercury’s star-like point which can appear slightly pinkish or pale whiskey in colour in the twilight.Venus makes a welcome return this month and gleams low in the west-northwest after sunset during the second half of April. Venus and Mercury are less than two moon-widths apart on the evening of the 25th but sink fast in the twilight so find a clear horizon to spot them. Once you find Venus, use binoculars to glimpse nearby fainter Mercury.Mars hangs around in our evening sky until the early hours - especially with summertime now in effect. It has now faded a little but is still a reasonably bright object as it charges through Taurus, before crossing into Gemini on the 25th. The Moon passes by Mars on the evening of the 17th.Jupiter rises just over an hour before the Sun at the beginning of April but appears nearly two hours beforehand by the end of the month. It can be found in the east-southeast at this time amongst the dim stars of Capricornus.The waning Moon is close to Jupiter on the morning of April 7th and later in the month, on the 26th, the planet crosses into Aquarius.Saturn can be found in Capricornus and rises 90 minutes before the Sun on the 1st with that interval almost doubling by the end of April. The moon is a couple of days after last quarter when it is near Saturn on the 6th.The Lyrid meteor shower reaches maximum on April 22nd, but rates are generally low. There have been surprise outbursts however, with the last occasion being in 1982.Spaceflight this monthTwo missions reach the International Space Station during April, with the first scheduled to lift off from Baikonur on the 9th and ferry three members of the latest Expedition crew to their home for the next six months.The second operational Crew Dragon mission will be launched by SpaceX on April 22nd from the Kennedy Space Centre. Four astronauts from three different space agencies will replace the current Crew-1 participants who return to Earth in early May.The ISS itself is only visible in the evening sky from Ireland during the first couple of days of April and then starts a series of morning passes from the end of the month.The core module of China’s next generation space station Tianhe (“Harmony of the heavens”) is provisionally scheduled for launch at the end of April. The next few years will see it accommodate various crews and a gradual expansion of the facility as additional sections are bolted on.John Flannery is a long-time amateur astronomer with an interest in the history and lore of the sky along with astronomical phenomena observable with the unaided eye.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsSolidarity with The Silenced.Justice for the Cabra Road One.The Sinn Féin leader was “Brollied” in the Dáil on Wednesday and her colleagues were disgusted.Cut off in full flow for the second time in a row by the Phantom Microphone Muffler of the Lower House. Her ordeal mirrored the treatment meted out to Joe Brolly on RTÉ’s Claire Byrne Live show a couple of weeks ago when the outspoken GAA pundit was cancelled mid-interview because of remarks he made about the DUP.A few days later and Mary Lou was similarly disconnected, mid-sentence, from the Convention Centre’s PA system. In her case it wasn’t a content issue but rather because she was banging on for too long.But she let it pass, as did her supporters, which was surprising.Fast forward to this week’s Leaders’ Questions and the Dublin Central TD is silenced yet again as she engages with the Taoiseach.An outrageous thing to do.Or maybe an outrageously brave thing to do.It’s a plucky man or woman who decides to mute the formidable Sinn Féin leader when she’s up on her feet and holding forth. It goes against the commonly held belief that it is humanly impossible for anyone to stop Mary Lou from making her point if that is what she wants to do. Furthermore, a person or persons responsible for turning off her mic risk incurring the wrath of her ardent supporters, who take a very dim view of people slighting their leader.The latest outrage happened when the Ceann Comhairle indicated that her speaking time had expired. She had been questioning Micheál Martin on the Department of Health’s practice of gathering information on children with autism who are involved in legal actions against the State.TDs routinely ignore the first intervention. Deputy McDonald ploughed on. So Seán Ó Fearghail called time again. Leaders routinely ignore the second intervention.“Time is up deputy, please” insisted the Chair. Mary Lou kept on talking but there was no sound, so she had to admit defeat. “Thank you for shutting off my microphone” she sniffed, reluctantly resuming her seat.“I didn’t turn off your microphone, or anyone else’s,” shrugged the Ceann Comhairle.The Taoiseach responded. He too ran over. Ó Fearghail harried him, but Micheál Martin was also impervious to his pleadings. Once, twice, three times he was told to finish up, but to no avail.Sinn Féin’s Padraig Mac Lochlainn was seething at the injustice of the situation. He interrupted with a point of order. How come the Taoiseach is allowed speak for “about 30 or 40 seconds” over time when his party leader (and other speakers) are unceremoniously silenced “for the second week in a row?”Micheál was still talking as the Ceann Comhairle was barking at Sinn Féin’s Whip to sit down and mind his own business and Mac Lochlainn was noisily insisting on urgent clarification from the Chair.“Why are microphones being turned off when the Taoiseach’s microphone remains on? Why are microphones being turned off?”The Ceann Comhairle urged him not to bring the House into “disrepute” but Padraig had the bit between his teeth.“I asked WHO turned off the microphones?”Ó’Feargháil, who likes to keep an orderly house, resembled a tortured barman calling time over and over again, imprisoned for all eternity in a disorderly closing-time loop.He leapt to his feet, growing more annoyed by the second.“I’ll tell you what, in more than five years occupying this chair, I have never turned off anybody’s microphone” he bellowed, jowls a quiver. “I have asked people to abide by the time limits, which are generally ignored. Will you not ignore me and please resume your seat. You’re out of order. YOU’RE OUT OF ORDER!”Padraig relented. “Fair enough,” sez he. “Will whoever is turning off the microphones please stop doing it?”There has to be a better way to enforce good time keeping. Ushers using long shepherd’s crooks or Vaudeville hooks to yank long-winded TDs off the stage would be entertaining.Or maybe the Ceann Comhairle’s first warning could trigger a Dáil “Countdown Clock” with windbag TDs disappearing through the floor to the countdown sound of “du-du du-du de-de-de-de Boom!”Moving onBut with no useful props, all Sean Ó Feargháil could do was declare the debate at an end and plot a course for calmer waters. “We are moving on to Deputy Kelly.”That would be Labour leader Alan Kelly, normally expected at this point in the proceedings to be clutching a grenade and pulling the pin out with his teeth.But the pandemic has turned him disgracefully co-operative and mellow.He began by wishing the Taoiseach well with his new Covid strategy. “The country needs you to deliver and we will play a constructive role in whatever way we can and we will criticise where necessary …. I hope and pray that you deliver.”But a good outcome depends on Micheál getting the plan right because “you’ve put all your eggs in the basket of the vaccine basket”. As you do.Alan Kelly was anxious to dig into the Government’s data for a large number of reasons, one of which is very close to his heart.“My wedding anniversary is in July,” he announced, all of a sudden.“I’m going to offer to take my wife out for dinner in a restaurant she chooses,” he proudly puffed. What a guy. Imagine that, he’s even letting her pick the establishment.

File photograph: Alan Betson Northern Ireland institutions are “just about hanging on” after a “bruising number of years” and the focus must be on building relationships rather than on a border poll, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.Mr Coveney also told the Seanad that “we can move away from threats of legal action” after the UK’s unilateral move to extend the grace period for post-Brexit checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain until October 1st.During a debate on Brexit he told Senators,“we can get back to partnership through a specialised committee and joint committee” and can get the Northern Ireland protocol “back on an even keel”.He also said it was an opportunity for “more pragmatism and flexibility from the European Commission as well”.The Minister admitted that “I’ve become some sort of a bogey man” over the protocol but “the irony is” that his office more than any other “has been constantly talking to the European Commission about need to for pragmatism and compromise”.In an impassioned contribution he said the narrative “now is that it is being foisted on Northern Ireland by the EU and Irish Government and it’s not”.The protocol “was designed as much in London as it was in Brussels, which people seem to conveniently forget”, he pointed out.It is a solution “that isn’t perfect but is certainly the best way of mitigating the disruption on the island of Ireland”.He warned that a collapse in the protocol would result in two “very unpalatable choices” for Ireland.To protect Ireland’s place in the EU market, the State would have to put some kind of border infrastructure in place, which would be politically impossible “or we would be taken out of the EU market by default”.United IrelandSpeaking about calls for a border poll on a united Ireland, Mr Coveney said the focus had to be on building relationships first because the Northern Ireland institutions are not functioning as they should. They are “just about hanging on” after a “bruising number of years”.He said that “perhaps the most challenging element of Brexit” was in how to rebuild relationships “that have undoubtedly been damaged.“Good things happen in Northern Ireland when the British and Irish governments work together,” he added.Earlier Fianna Fáil Senator Niall Blaney said there is no border in the Irish Sea and “we should knock that every chance we get”. He said “it is an imaginary border”.The Donegal Senator said unionists are in an awkward position and “we don’t need to do anything that ramps that up but rather the opposite”.He said those calling for a North-South poll needed to be reminded “of how the Good Friday Agreement was won”.He said a similar sentiment is needed now “this country coming together as one isn’t necessarily about territory but is more about people”.He said of Fianna Fáil’s relationship with Sinn Féin that “we sometimes rub each other up the wrong way” but everyone had work to do for a border poll “down the road” and Sinn Féin needed to put more emphasis on building relationships with unionists.

File photograph: The In comments made at the weekly meeting of TDs and Senators, Ms Foley said “it is important and helpful” that the National Immunisation Advisory Council (Niac) “explain their rationale for this move”.The change, which shifted to an age-based allocation rather than one based on age and profession, has sparked a backlash from teachers and other unions.Ms Foley told colleagues that she believed it is a significant change and paid tribute to the work of special needs assistants and teachers during the pandemic.The meeting also heard from Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly, who said that the 65-69-year-olds should be vaccinated in April and May however, the meeting was told that 860,000 vaccines were now expected in April – previously Mr Donnelly had said 1 million doses were expected next month. Prior to the meeting a leading Fianna Fáil backbencher characterised changes to the prioritisation list as a decision to “pull the rug” from under some workers. Former minister for agriculture Barry Cowen said he understood the decision, that it was based on “science and reasoning”. But he argued that a group of workers would feel deflated having been assured their place would be higher due to infection risk associated with their employment.“Now suddenly to pull the rug from under them is far from ideal and most disheartening and disturbing for those cohorts,” said Mr Cowen prior to Wednesday evening’s meeting of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party.He said that from early on in the pandemic it was known that coronavirus had a more severe impact on older and vulnerable people. “But Niac and Government persisted in promising and assuring key workers their place would be higher because of the risk of infection associated with their employment.”He said the decision “undoubtedly increases the pressure and absolute need to adhere now to vaccination rollout promisestargetscommitments”. Referring to the Government’s ambition to have 80 per cent of the adult population receive one shot by the end of June, he said that required administering 250,000 doses per week from here on.“It means having GPs, pharmacists and all vaccinator personnel and centres at full tilt from here on ensuring that 250,000 a week is met. Failure to live up to those commitments would be a further blow to those impacted by this change of direction announced by NiacGovernment in vaccination strategy.”Crowded workplacesMr Cowen was among several TDs to raise the issue at the meeting, including Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown’s Cormac Devlin. Mr Cowen said that special needs assistants should be considered under Cohort 9, those in crowded workplaces. He told the meeting that he accepted reluctantly the change, but called for a timeline for the vaccination programme to be published. And he said there were questions about the role of pharmacists that had to be addressed.Taoiseach Micheál Martin defended the decision, saying older teachers and special needs assistants will get the vaccine sooner under the new system which he said will allow for a faster rollout. Mr Martin told the meeting that a further easing of restrictions in March or April risked a surge in cases which could put the summer at risk. And he said the Government was following public health advice and trying to “strike the right balance”. Mr Martin also told the parliamentary party that opening up too early could “wreck” the summer and that there was a need to contain the virus while ramping up the vaccines programme. He said supply of vaccines had “hardened up” which would allow for expansion of the rollout. He told the meeting that if the state was “too liberal” in opening up in March and April “we risk paying for it in the summer dealing with it”.Dara Calleary, the former minister for agriculture, and Mr Devlin said the outdoor furniture scheme for the hospitality sector, announced by Minister for Culture Catherine Martin, should be extended to wet pubs. Mr Calleary said the industry “is on its knees and they need support”.The Mayo TD also asked the Taoiseach to engage directly with gardaí and teachers “to reassure them on the vaccine rollout” following the reprioritisation.Minister of State for Trade Promotion Robert Troy said that the Department of Enterprise is considering supports for tradespeople – the “man or woman in the van” – who are missing out on supports as they are not ratable businesses. His department is seeking to amend or introduce a scheme to help such businesses with fixed overheads, which will take a number of weeks.Mr Martin also discussed his republicanism, saying it was in the tradition of Wolfe Tone, to achieve unity of Catholic, Protestant and dissenter. He said the national question was one of the reasons he became involved in politics, but warned that sloganeering would not achieve unity."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4523761.1617082881!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ten eu states to halt extraditions to uk following brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe European Arrest Warrant was introduced in 2004 and obliges member states to arrest and transfer suspects to countries where they were wanted.Ten EU member states have said they will no longer extradite their nationals to the UK following Brexit, the British Home Office has said.Countries including France, Germany and Poland have informed the UK of their refusal to allow the extradition of their nationals.Two more — Austria and the Czech Republic — will only hand over suspects to the UK with their consent.The European Arrest Warrant was introduced in 2004 and obliged member states to arrest and transfer suspects to countries where they were wanted.The letter, sent from the Home Office to the House of Lords EU committee dates from earlier this month and was first reported by The Times.It said: “I can confirm a total of 10 EU Member States have notified of their intention to exercise an absolute bar on the extradition of own nationals.

He later joked to MPs that Mr Cummings had been scouting out the complex during his Easter Saturday visit last year.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"emmanuel macron expected announce strict new lockdown measures","story":"Emmanuel Macron has announced strict new month-long measures including closing schools for three weeks, abandoning his efforts to keep France out of a third coronavirus lockdown.  The French president  had ignored the pleas of his scientific advisors to close up the country in January but the spread of the contagious British variant and spiking infections forced him into a U-turn. We will lose control if we do not move now, he said in a televised address. Non-essential shops will be closed and travel more than 10km from home is forbidden, unless there is a good reason. Travel between French regions is banned from April 5. People must work from home if they can and a 7pm curfew will stay in place, as Mr Macron extended measures in some French regions to the whole country. Mr Macron had hoped to pursue a “third way” of fighting coronavirus without ordering people to stay at home and keeping the economy as open as possible. In February it had appeared that Mr Macron’s gamble had paid off with cases flatlining under a curfew but with shops and schools open. He was forced to act after daily coronavirus cases doubled to about 40,000 and hospitals in infection hotspots like Paris were swamped. 44 percent of people in intensive care with Covid were below 65, he said. On Wednesday night, in a primetime television address, Mr Macron defended his decision to keep France out of lockdown. He insisted that every day the country was open was a day gained in the fightback for economic recovery. He said that unlike Germany or Italy, which were in their fourth lockdowns, France had enjoyed “precious days of freedom”. We have opted since the beginning of 2021 for a response that aimed to curb the epidemic without locking down, Mr Macron said.“We have won precious days of freedom, weeks of education for our children, without ever losing control of the epidemic. I think it was the right thing to do.France’s slow vaccination campaign and his refusal to lockdown earlier have put the French president under pressure from politicians and medical experts. “We could have done better, we have made some mistakes, all of this is true, he said. Mr Macron, a vocal supporter of the EU’s discredited vaccine procurement strategy, faces elections next year and far right leader Marine Le Pen is rising in the polls.Ms Le Pen said: The measures announced by Macron are the result of a vaccination Waterloo for which he does not take responsibility.On Wednesday night, Pfizer accused the EU of hindering the vaccination effort.EU rules introduced in February obliging the manufacturer to seek Brussels\u0027 approval before exporting jabs had caused a significant administrative burden and some uncertainty, said Danny Hendrikse, the pharmaceutical giant\u0027s vice-president of global supply.France has administered about 10.7m jabs, far fewer than the UK’s 30.9 million doses. Mr Macron said France would step up its vaccinations and reassured people that all the jabs, including AstraZeneca, were safe and effective. He said vets would be drafted in to join the mass vaccination campaign. Thanks to vaccination, the end of the crisis is finally within reach, he said. Mr Macron last reluctantly imposed tougher restrictions on March 20, closing non-essential shops and introducing travel restrictions, in Paris and other regions of the country.  The rules, which allowed people to meet outside and schools to stay open, hit about a third of the population. The French lockdown was announced as Britain introduces new rules from April 6 aimed at preventing new variants entering the UK. Lorry drivers, cabin crew and seasonal workers entering England will have to take a Covid test within 48 hours of arrival from April 6. Despite the setback, the avidly pro-EU Mr Macron, who falsely claimed the Oxford University jab was quasi-ineffective in the over 65s in January, is still expected to beat the Eurosceptic Ms Le Pen in elections. He is among the toughest of EU leaders on the ongoing row over vaccine supplies with Britain. He supported Ursula von der Leyen’s calls for tough vaccine export rules aimed at the UK at a summit last week and vowed that Brussels would block any export of AstraZeneca until it made up shortfalls of millions of doses to the bloc.It came as the head of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said there was “no evidence” to support restricting the use of AstraZeneca in any population, after Germany suspended its use over blood clot fears. The EU’s drugs regulator said that a causal link between unusual blood clots was “not proven but is possible” but added that the benefits of the jab outweigh the risks. Emer Cooke, EMA executive director, said 62 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis have been reviewed out of 9.2 million people in the European Economic Area.There were no specific risk factors such as age or gender for the “very rare” blood clots, she said. According to the current scientific knowledge, there is no evidence that would support restricting the use of this vaccine in any population, she said. The German medicines regulator reported 31 cases of a type of rare brain blood clot among the nearly 2.7 million people who received the AstraZeneca jab in the country. Some regions including Berlin have banned the jab for people under the age of 60. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your

plead ministers","story":"Vaccinated Britons will be urged not to hug in a new government campaign that comes amid fears that people are more likely to ignore social distancing rules once jabbed.The Cabinet Office is preparing a new social media poster campaign that will call on people who have been inoculated against Covid to abide by the rules as they are relaxed to allow more social contact.“The messaging will be aimed at people who have been vaccinated to stop them going off-piste and ignoring the regulations and particularly with the elderly who have had two jabs,” said a senior source.“It will be along the lines that it is great that you have been vaccinated but if you are going to visit your family and hug your grandchildren, there is a chance you are going to infect people you love.”A similar campaign has been run during lockdown in which older vaccinated people were urged to stay at home to save lives. The posters featuring older Britons warned that they could still transmit the disease even after being jabbed. “There is still a risk you could spread coronavirus, even after you have been vaccinated,” they warned.It follows research by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) which found nearly half of all older people who were vaccinated against Covid-19 in England were breaking lockdown rules.Researchers found that compliance with coronavirus restrictions started to wane after the initial injection, with 41 per cent of respondents reporting that they had broken the rules by meeting up with someone indoors.UK lockdown restrictions made it illegal to meet socially with family or friends unless they are part of a person’s household or support bubble.Janet Lord, director of Birmingham University’s Institute of Inflammation and Ageing, said people should not hug their children even if they had been vaccinated as relaxing social distancing could offset the benefits of the vaccination programme.“I would certainly advise not to do that at the moment because as you probably know with the vaccines they take several weeks before they are maximally effective, she said. “It’s really important that people stay on their guard even if they’ve had that first vaccination.”A Cabinet office spokesperson confirmed it was working on updating assets for step two of the Government’s roadmap which this week saw the return of the rule of six or outdoor meetings of two households, and a shift from stay at home to stay local.The new message would be regularly put out on official communication channels, including Gov.uk and during national press conferences.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access

opened to British holidaymakers by June under a traffic light system, an analysis of vaccination and Covid rates shows.As Boris Johnson prepares to unveil the framework for resuming foreign travel from May 17, only a handful of European countries will be low enough risk to permit quarantine-free holidays by the earliest date of May 17 for the resumption of flights abroad, according to the analysis.Travellers returning from such green list countries are still likely to be required to pay for lateral flow tests in order to go on holiday but are expected to escape quarantine under the plans.They include the traditional holiday destinations of Malta, Gibraltar, Portugal and Israel, which are expected to have vaccinated at least half their adult populations by May 17, maintained low Covid and variant rates and have comprehensive testing regimes.Three more popular destinations – Spain, Greece and Turkey – would be on a putative amber list, where it is likely any travellers would be expected to have a pre-departure test within 72 hours of return, a test on arrival and at least three days quarantine.Others on the green list include the USA, which aims to have its adult population vaccinated at least once by mid-May, Canada, Barbados and the United Arab Emirates, according to the analysis by travel consultancy The PC Agency.On Monday, the Prime Minister is expected to confirm plans for a staged return to foreign travel based on a traffic light-style system but without naming any destinations.It is still too early to say where and when people will be able to go on holidays, but there will be detail about what that will look like, said a Government source.The global travel task force chaired by Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, is due to report a week later, on April 12, setting out how travel will be resumed no earlier than May 17.Travel industry chiefs anticipate most countries are unlikely to open as green list destinations for  British holidaymakers until July or August. The biggest concern within Government is the risk from new variants that could undermine the efficacy of the UK\u0027s successful vaccination programme.It means foreign travel from red list countries at high risk of new variants will remain banned and any returning Britons will have to quarantine in Government-approved hotels.Ministers are expected to meet at the Covid O Cabinet committee on Thursday to review global travel but are not expected to add any European countries to the 35-strong red list.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"justin welby has forgotten spiritual point church","story":"The morning after Meghan and Harry’s interview with Oprah Winfrey, in which they mentioned that the Archbishop of Canterbury had married them twice, I tweeted at Justin Welby asking for clarification. How could this be possible, given the law on weddings in this country? The question found the Archbishop stuck between a rock and a hard place: the public wanted to know what had really happened, but he felt a responsibility to honour the confidences of a couple he had married. Only now, three weeks later, has he given his response, telling the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that the St George’s Chapel wedding was indeed the legal one. This dilemma sums up an age-old problem. Being Archbishop of Canterbury has always been a dance between dual roles: as both a leading figure in the public sphere – with a role in the constitution, a seat in the House of Lords and an expectation that they will bring Christian values to bear on the issues of the day – and as a spiritual pastor, ministering to the religious needs of both iniduals and the nation as a whole. When it comes to the political side of his role, Archbishop Welby has not been shy to make his views known. The Repubblica interview alone covered pandemics, free speech, relations with Europe, racism and housing. Yet, in a pandemic people surely want to hear more from the senior clerics they would once have turned to for guidance on spiritual matters.Soon after Archbishop Welby began his term of office, he held a reception for journalists at Lambeth Palace. “What do you think?” I asked a reporter from the BBC. “I’m not particularly religious,” came the reply, “but I like religious leaders to be spiritual, to seem like they’re in touch with God, and this one’s, well, a bit corporate.”If Welby does come across like this, it’s not surprising. For one, he used to be a top executive in the oil industry, and for another, being leader of the Anglican Communion is rather like being the CEO of a worldwide corporation. Being interviewed by La Repubblica enabled the Archbishop to remind Italians, especially those running the Vatican, that he should be seen as equivalent to the Pope in terms of global reach. Given the difficulties facing the Church at home, however, this may be seen as a strange choice. The Church of England’s equivalent of the poor bloody infantry, the people in the pews and their vicars, could be forgiven for wondering why he does not have more to say to them. Britain faces another Easter with large numbers of churches closed. Many parishioners are still angry that the Archbishop did not fight harder to keep them open in the first lockdown, when the Church’s rules went beyond those of the Government in barring clergy from their own churches. They are worried, too, about the long-term future of their churches as congregations decline and financial pressures increase. The Archbishop is due shortly to begin a three-month sabbatical. This is time he could spend focusing not only on his own spiritual renewal but on the message he hopes to share and what he wants to achieve as Archbishop.In the meantime, in Holy Week, what most Anglicans really long for are his thoughts on the one who died on the Cross and rose again three days later.

Now the EU’s top leaders are warming towards the Russian-made jab, in a propaganda coup for Vladimir Putin.On Tuesday, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel joined with Putin to discuss “cooperation” over the use and manufacture of the Sputnik jab. Has the EU just sacrificed any remaining vestige of moral authority, in the face of vaccine desperation?The UK now has falling Covid deaths, falling hospitalisations and rapid vaccine rollout – with 45 per cent of our population inoculated, covering almost all those in vulnerable age groups. The EU is, meanwhile, enduring a destructive third wave, across a continent where little more than one in 10 have received jabs.The EU’s joint vaccine procurement scheme was meant to demonstrate power and unity, exemplifying why the “European project” exists. But it has been a fiasco, resulting in unnecessary loss of life, with the vast majority of older and medically vulnerable citizens still unvaccinated. EU leaders have lashed out, blaming everyone but themselves, often acting irrationally. Now, amid much harsh rhetoric and finger-pointing, the bloc appears to be turning to Moscow for help – in a sharp reversal of previous statements and actions.Russia is subject to EU sanctions for annexing Crimea, with some Kremlin officials also under international restrictions for the poisoning and jailing of opposition activist Alexei Navalny. Just weeks ago, Merkel branded his treatment “far from any rule of law standards”, demanding Navalny’s immediate release. Back in November, when Hungarian leader Viktor Orban opted to use the Sputnik vaccine, he was criticised by Brussels. Other EU members, including Slovakia and the Czech Republic, have since done the same, not waiting for the EU regulator before buying and approving Sputnik.While the Russian vaccine has yet to be licensed by the European Medicines Agency, the AstraZeneca jab has. Yet this “British vaccine” has been endlessly criticised by Macron and Merkel on utterly unsubstantiated safety grounds, even as Brussels-based Eurocrats aggressively accuse the UK of blocking EU access to the vaccine.After repeated smears, the EU public no longer trusts the AstraZeneca jab. That’s left the likes of Germany and France sitting on millions of doses they are unable to administer.Brussels insists the bloc doesn’t need Sputnik to hit its target of dosing 70 per cent of the adult population by autumn. Ahead of tough negotiations with Moscow, they would say that wouldn’t they? And given how Merkel, Macron and others are now junking fundamental political and human rights concerns in a bid to speed up inoculation rates, they appear to need the Russian vaccine very much indeed.For EU enthusiasts this side of the Channel, this latest news amounts, perhaps, to a fourth stage of grief. First, they’ve had to admit post-Brexit Britain was right to opt out of the EU’s ridiculously bureaucratic vaccine programme. They’ve then watched the EU fail dismally, with many member states now choosing self-procurement – not just in Eastern Europe, but Denmark and Austria too. Thirdly, Brussels has damaged its economic reputation, imposing export bans amid ongoing threats to requisition privately owned pharmaceutical factories, while trashing a perfectly safe vaccine, offered at cost price, by a world-class British company.And now, the EU could do a deal with Moscow, breaking a united Western front. Yes, Sputnik may well be safe and effective. Health issues are the priority and the EU badly needs faster vaccination. But negotiating with Russia from its current, desperate position, while sitting on millions of AstraZeneca jabs, discredited in a deeply irresponsible post-Brexit propaganda exercise, is a tragic situation for the EU to have put itself in and bad for the West as a whole.The signatories of the 1957 Treaty of Rome sought to “lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe”. With the Continent ravaged by war twice over the previous half-century, this was clearly a noble intention. But consider how Brussels treated Greece during the 2011 eurozone crisis, how it imposed swingeing austerity programmes on nations like Portugal and Ireland to bail out German bankers? Consider how the Eurocrats have sought to reverse countless referendums over the years, including in the UK.Consider how the EU is still – still – trying to destabilise the Good Friday Agreement, fanning the flames of sectarian violence by doggedly insisting on ridiculously invasive and legalistic physical border checks between Northern Ireland and the British mainland, where technological solutions would clearly suffice, in a last-ditch attempt to keep the UK within the EU’s legal orbit.And consider how the EU has handled this pandemic, the greatest challenge to statecraft since the Second World War.

However, the Danish government in March announced a controversial scheme to cut the number of minority-ethnic people in housing estates such as Taastrupgaard.I am very happy to live here and I cannot see myself living anywhere else, says Ms Taidi, a 25-year-old student, as she makes her way up the stairs out of the estate.I cannot see what\u0027s going be better if \u0027we\u0027 are not here, and if 70 per cent of Danish people move here.The estate, which sits between Copenhagen and Roskilde, has been put on Denmark\u0027s \u0027ghetto-list\u0027 of troubled areas every year since the controversial category was created in 2010.The long strip of prefabricated 1970s concrete barracks, sandwiched between a railway depot and a busy road, is no beauty spot. But it only qualifies as a ghetto because a high proportion of residents have a low level of education, that there\u0027s a low average income, and more than 50 percent of residents are \u0027non-Western immigrants\u0027.Denmark\u0027s government - led by the anti-immigration Social Democrat party - now aims to reduce the number of non-Western residents in housing areas across the country to 30 per cent or less within ten years.The plan is to deny them the right to public housing in some areas, while forcing private landlords to rent to them in other, predominantly ethnic Danish, areas.The proposal calls for the replacement of the \u0027ghetto\u0027 category, which it describes as stigmatising, with the terms transformation area and parallel society.According to Esat Senturk, a politician at the local Taastrup municipality, who grew up on the estate, the area has never suffered serious crime or social problems.It was a wonderful place because Taastrupgaard has a special culture, he says. Where I live now doesn\u0027t have the same sense of neighbourliness. People really looked out for one another in Taastrupgaard. I miss it.The housing ministry defended the use of the \u0027non-Western\u0027 category, telling the  it has been used by Statistics Denmark since 2002 to describe first, second and third-generation immigrants from countries outside the EUEEA, UK, Canada, US, Australia and New Zealand.The non-western tenants criterion is used because the earlier initiatives targeting vulnerable areas suggested that a high concentration of non-western tenants is a challenge to the transformation of social housing estates into mixed resident communities, since it can pose an integration issue in addition to the socio-economic issues, it said in a statement.But for Mr Senturk the focus on ethnicity, in reality, reflects what he calls immigrant-bashing in Danish politics, which over the past ten years has spread from the populist Danish People\u0027s Party to the mainstream parties of both Left and Right.As soon as someone wants more votes, they just shout \u0027religion\u0027 or \u0027ethnicity\u0027. They\u0027re cheap points to chase, instead of solving the real problems, he said.The ghetto plan policies of recent years have if anything led to a downward spiral at the estate, he argues.It just frightens people so people don\u0027t dare come and live here, and that makes the people even more isolated. It means that people don\u0027t feel they\u0027re part of Danish society, because they feel that they should quite simply be got rid of.The people in Taastrupgaard and the municipality have worked year after year to lift the estate out of the ghetto list, with detailed plans made in 2016, and then in 2018, only to see the criteria change so that it falls back, he complains.A few blocks away from the flat where Mr Senturk grew up, bulldozers are busy flattening the ground where a succession of the barrack blocks have been demolished, part of a plan to move the local school from the edge to the centre of the estate.Before this plan is even half complete, the Social Democrats\u0027 new policy will mean the municipality has to come up with a new one.I\u0027m really worried about it, first and foremost, about where people can find places to live, Mr Senturk says. If people are going to be forced to move from here, where are they going to go, and how can you force people to live here, people who have a bad view of Taastrupgaard?Even if the 30 per cent target is met, he isn\u0027t sure it will help.Getting more ethnic Danes into Taaastrupsgaard won\u0027t solve the problem, because the problem isn\u0027t ethnicity.Ms Taidi says the plan just makes her feel a little more conscious that even though she has spent her whole life in Denmark, she will always be viewed as an immigrant.We\u0027re used to it, but I think it\u0027s a bad thing, because we\u0027re all people. We shouldn\u0027t put ourselves in categories with \u0027Western\u0027 people here and \u0027non-Western\u0027 people there.I feel I\u0027m Danish because I\u0027m born and raised here.  It\u0027s not like I need a passport to prove that.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"gaslighting race report full tory","story":"NewsopinionGaslighting race report full of Tory lies to delight a supporter base in denialThe UK is not innocent, and I will not let this government gaslight me about institutional racism, writes former Apprentice candidate and commentator Joanna JarjuemirrorShareCommentsByJoanna Jarjue, former Apprentice candidate and commentator:,  MAR Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video britain-not-institutionally-racist-says-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:MkOHucDQ,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

They are all lies, and all Tory soundbites to delight a section of its supporter base that is very often in denial about these issues. The mention of white working-class children underperforming in school versus black children set off one of the major alarm bells for me in this report. One of the classic rebuttals whenever we talk about institutional racism and especially white privilege is “what about the white working-class” how are they privileged  It’s the idea that the problem must always be class and not a race and that it’s poor white people who in fact have it worse. Yet the report conveniently brushes past the fact that no matter how well black children do at GCSE when marked anonymously, social mobility is still lower than their white counterparts, and the gap in career prospects and progression the higher we go up the food chain gets even wider regardless of merit and education. While some people stunned by the report may wonder how the government has such confidence to completely rubbish a subject as sensitive as racism publicly, it didn’t surprise me that the report came to this conclusion. The loophole is an age-old tory tactic which isyou find a few black or brown faces to say something isn’t racist, it cancels out the cries of hundreds of thousands of othersapos lived experiences.  The daily poster child for this strategy in Parliament is Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch who is often used as the token to push the Government’s agenda, and it appears some of the criteria for the commission’s team was “minorities who don’t believe in racism”. Critics of the government would be justied to think that from the onset, members appointed to this team seem to have been hand-picked for this reason. This is especially true when considering the history of institutional racism denial by Policy lead Munira Mirza and the stereotypically damaging articles written about black boys by the Commission chief Tony Sewell in the past.When I attended the Black Lives Matter march last summer, I held a sign which read “The UK is not innocent”. I made that statement because as soon as discussions started about the horric killing of George Floyd, the narrative by right-wing commentators began about how terrible it is in America and how we have no such things happening in the UK.To them, my response would be simple - Stephen Lawrence, Joy Gardner, Smiley Culture, Sarah Reed, Mark Duggan and the list sadly goes on. The sensibility of the British stf upper lip has overspilled into an attitude of sweeping race issues under the carpet and breeding a culture of national denial. I protested because I knew that one day, I could have a baby boy and while giving birth to him, I would be five times more likely to die than my white friends.I protested because that boy could then grow up to be a young man who is more likely to be expelled from school, eight times more likely to be racially profiled and stopped and searched by the police, and again the list goes on.Yet, the government have told me today that my reasons for protesting were “well-meaning idealism” and essentially all in my head.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  Perhaps naively, I felt a sense of hope for a new day for race relations last summer when I saw the masses doing the work, having the dficult conversations and pledging to do better.However, it feels that when it comes to the topic of race, we the people can take two steps forward, only for the people with real power and influence to bring us five steps back, and this comes from both directions of the political sphere.On one hand, the government has sidestepped the Lammy report’s recommendations four years ago, only to do their own report which cites Lammy’s findings on discrimination in criminal justice with a tone of debunking myths and spin alluding that some of these publicly recorded racial disparities are “not as bad as they seemaposapos. On the other side of the political ide, we have Keir Starmer who was performatively kneeling for Black Lives Matter to show solidarity but then diminished the movement to what he called a “moment” to the BBC, while also doing little to tackle the anti-black racism exposed in the leaked internal report by Labour HQ. It’s almost comical at this point that public political figures have the guts to wonder and ask questions about why there are such high levels of vaccine hesitancy and lack of trust in institutions and experts by minorities.

Boris Johnson is preparing to unveil plans for the resumption of foreign travel.A task force led by the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is looking at the possibility of re-opening international travel, with a report said to be handed to the Prime Minister in the coming days. Reports say that on Monday he is expected to announce plans for ato travel abroad using a apostraffic lightapos style system. This would reportedly see travel to aposredapos countries banned, holidays to aposamberapos nations needing a negative test and quarantine, with aposgreenapos countries giving some form of exemption but with testing. Now, the Dailyreports that only about a dozen destinations could be categorised as aposgreenapos and therefore safe to travel under Covid restrictions by June. The paper claims that Malta, Gibraltar, Portugal, Israel, Canada, Barbados, the UAE and the US could all be put into the lowest category because of their plans to vaccinate half the adult population by mid-May. Three other popular destinations, Spain, Greece and Turkey, would reportedly be on the amber list, which includes quarantine measures.

The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities said the UK is no longer a country where the “system is deliberately rigged” against ethnic minorities. But No was criticised for a “basic own goal” after the report was released late to selected journalists with strict orders not to seek reaction. The Boris Johnson-ordered review suggested the UK should be a “model” for other countries because of its success in improving equality. But the report, commissioned after the Black Lives Matter anti-racism protests last summer, was accused of “glorying” the slave trade. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section The -page review suggested ­children should be taught the “slave period” was “not only about profit and suffering” but “how culturally African people transformed themselves”. Race relations think-tank the Runnymede Trust said it felt “deeply let down” by the findings. Director Halima Begum said: “All this is a whitewash and a script that has been written to  Downing Street.” Commission chairman Dr Tony Sewell claimed some communities are “haunted” by historic racism which led to a “deep mistrust” and could be holding them back. Yesterday’s report criticised “bleak” thinking among some anti-racist campaigners who seek to blame all disparities on white discrimination. It claimed that white prejudice is “dwindling” and those campaigners “ert attention” from other reasons for minority success and failure. Dr Sewell claimed while racism is a “real force” in Britain, particularly online, there is no proof that institutional racism exists. He said: “Disparities do exist, they are ied, and ironically very few are directly to do with racism. Too often ‘racism’ is the catch-all explanation.” The study concluded factors other than race – including family, geography and deprivation – had a bigger impact on le chances. “No one denies and no one is saying racism doesn’t exist,” he said. “We found anecdotal evidence of this. However, evidence of actual ­institutional racism  No, that wasn’t there, we didn’t find that.” Critics questioned the ­suitability of Dr Sewell and No policy chief Munira Mirza, who set up the commission, who have previously questioned the existence of ­institutional racism. Labour MP David Lammy accused the report of “gaslighting” – that is manipulating black Brits into questioning their thoughts or experiences. He said it is an “insult to anybody and everybody across this country who experiences institutional racism”. Runnymede’s Dr Begum said: ­“Institutionally, we are still racist, and for a Government-appointed ­com­­mission to look into [institutional] racism, to deny its ­existence is deeply, deeply worrying.” She added: “I’m absolutely flabbergasted to see the slave trade apparently redefined as ‘the Caribbean Experience’, as though it’s something Thomas Cook should be selling – a one-way shackled cruise to purgatory.” Shadow Women and Equalities Secretary Marsha de Cordova said: “To downplay institutional racism in a pandemic where black, Asian and ethnic minority people have died disproportionately and are twice as likely to be unemployed is an insult.” GMB national secretary Rehana Azam said: “Only this Government could produce a report on race in the st century that gaslights BAME people and communities. It’s immoral.” Prof Kehinde Andrews, a professor of Black Studies at Birmingham City University, said the report is not a “genuine effort” to understand racism. He said: “It’s complete nonsense. It goes in the face of all existing evidence. This is a PR move to pretend the problem doesn’t exist.” The TUC’s Frances O’Grady said it had “chosen to deny” experiences of minority ethnic and black workers who are far more likely to be in ­low-paid, insecure work. NHS Providers said there is “clear and unmistakable” evidence that NHS ethnic minority staff have worse ­experiences than white colleagues. The report found pupils from ethnic communities did as well or better than white children. Black Caribbean pupils were the only group to do less well.

Sanjeev Gupta said that while he was “not waiting” for a rescue package, “all help is welcome”. Three thousand jobs are threatened at  UK sites after the companyaposs main lender, Greensill Capital, collapsed. Ministers have rejected Libertyaposs bid for a £million rescue deal, fearing the money will be moved around the Gupta Family Group Alliance, which has businesses overseas.  Mr Gupta insisted “the future of the steel industry is very strong in the UK” as he confirmed he was battling to arrange emergency funding. “Iaposm very confident that we will find short-term solutions through our efforts and we will find long-term solutions through refinancing,” he told the BBC. “I am committed to my UK steel plants, I started here, I believe in them, they have a great future. We have saved thousands of jobs here.” He added: “None of my steel plants, under my watch, will be shut down, thataposs for sure.” The British arm could “benefit from more working capital” and a “huge amount of backers” were interested in backing Liberty, he claimed. “We arenapost waiting for anybody, we are taking matters into our own hands,” said Mr Gupta. “Iaposm not waiting for anybody to come to the rescue – we will help ourselves, but of course all help from everybody is always welcome.” His business model of buying ailing mills has come under fire as Liberty is mired in jeopardy. Experts have criticised the company for turning to Greensill – a supply chain financier – to support purchases. Admitting he owed a “substantial” amount to Greensill, Mr Gupta revealed it was “many billions”. But he added: “We have bought plant after plant which was either shut or shutting – in those situations we cannot access normal, conventional funding.” Buying and running his UK plants had been “a tough journey” and “a labour of love”, said Mr Gupta. Community steelworkersapos union operations director Alasdair McDiarmid said “developments have been very concerning”.  He added: “Of course we want the Government to put some money into Liberty Steel but the reality is no government is going to write out a cheque for £m without getting some pretty strong assurances about how and where that money is going to be used. It seems the Business Department had concerns the money could disappear into the GFG group and of course itaposs not going to help our steelworkerstaxpayersapos money ends up supporting Liberty operations in eastern Europe or Australia, or being sucked up by predators.” He said it would be “unthinkable” for Libertyaposs plants to shut, adding: “We hope that efforts to refinance the business will succeed. The stakes are high.” GMB national officer Ross Murdoch said: “Mr Gupta’s comments are very welcome – and will be welcomed by Liberty Steel workers across the country. “But to be able to give these guarantees with such confidence you have to assume he’s found the financing required to keep the company going. “If that’s the case he needs to let people know and stop workers worrying about their jobs.“Otherwise these comments just raise further questions.” Earlier this week, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said rescue plans were “commercially very sensitive”.

Director Laura Gardiner said: “The introduction of the national living wage has delivered a solid pay rise to minimum wage workers, and it’s welcome to see the Government continuing to commit to ambitious increases. “However, there is still a substantial gap between this wage rate and one based on the cost of living, with national living wage workers falling billions of pounds short of a Real Living Wage over the past five years. “The result has been millions of workers and families struggling to keep their heads above water.  “The number of employers signing up to the Real Living Wage has continued to grow, even during the pandemic, as businesses recognise the benefits of a healthy and motivated workforce. “Alongside a strong wage floor, more employers committing to go beyond the Government minimum and pay a Real Living Wage that meets the everyday needs of workers and families is how Britain recovers and rebuilds from this crisis.” The NLW was £. an hour when it was introduced in .

You can’t tackle institutional racismyou don’t believe it exists. What you end up doing is producing a document that echoes the ‘Nothing to see here’ denial of Boris Johnson’s government. The only surprise is that anyone is surprised. The only response is to continue providing the clear, statistical and anecdotal evidence to undermine the fantasy, delusion, and confused thinking. The report is particularly dangerous because it will embolden those who want to tell black and Asian people to “get over it” when they try to highlight the real disadvantages they face in modern Britain. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section The report’s dismissal of the concept of unconscious bias will also make the lives of those trying to bring about cultural change in the workplace a misery. The report authors did a round of TV and radio interviews attempting to justy their thinking. They succeeded only in showing themselves to be frighteningly detached from reality. Rejecting last summer’s call for the school curriculum to include a more accurate depiction of the British Empire, the report pointed to “a new story about the Caribbean experience,” where slavery was “not only being about profit and suffering”. Er, excuse me  Bear in mind, too, the way that the -page report was released by the government - piecemeal. Cheerleading highlights on Tuesday to selected print media and the rest the following day with the headlines already dominated by the  narrative. Mercully, however, that narrative is at odds with what many people - black and white - have had their eyes opened to over the past  months. Bear in mind too, that the analysis is tainted by the Independent Commission’s preconceived notions that institutional racism is not a thing. Munira Mirza - who oversaw the appointment of the commission - and chair Tony Sewell have previous for dismissing it three years ago.  The trouble is, their opinions fail the black women four to five times more likely to die in childbirth than their white counterparts - as shown in Channel ’s Dispatches documentary on Tuesday night. Also the government statistics from November which showed black people are nine times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people – with  percent of searches never actually resulting in a formal charge. What about the Home Office figures which reveal you are six times more likely to be subjected to “use of force” by policeyou are black  Or the fact that exclusion rates for black Caribbean students in English schools are six times higher than their white peers in some local authorities   Or the news last month that there are zero black or Asian men on the board of the publicly-funded BBC, in breach of its own rules on ersity  Or the revelation last summer that nine major sporting bodies in this country had just one black board member between them  For goodness’ sake, they are publishing this report while a pandemic is wiping out more Black and Asian people across the UK than any other demographic.

But that is no reason to rest on our laurels or pretend racism does not exist here. And that is why the Race Commission report has done black and Asian communities a disservice. The Commission appeared more interested in provoking a row than seeking to tackle hatred and discrimination. Its claim there is no evidence of institutional racism flies in the face of polling by Hope Not Hate which found % of black Britons and British Asians have experienced or witnessed racial abuse in the past  months and % think Britain is institutionally racist. The Commission needs to explain how it could reach such a conclusion when the figures show that black Britons are excluded from the higher ranks of almost every major profession and that people from ethnic minorities are twice as likely to be unemployed and have been twice as likely to die from Covid. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section This was a chance to set out a clear path for tackling ingrained inequality and injustice. This complacent report failed in that task, and insulted the people it was meant to serve. Laid to waste Our parks have been more important than ever during lockdown.

When Roux Owen was born with a swollen left eye it was initially put down to “birth trauma”. However when the swelling worsened and he started showing more symptoms his worried parents rushed him to AE. Roux was diagnosed with immature teratoma, a non-cancerous tumour that continues to grow, at just four weeks old.He had to have  brain surgeries, six of which were to remove the tumour, Leeds Live reports. But his mum says against the odds he survived and his latest scan results show the tumour has cleared. Roux’s parents, Amy and Anthony, have praised surgeons at Leeds General Infirmary and say they are eternally grateful to the medical staff for saving their little boy’s le. Speaking to Leeds Live , Amy, , who works as a teacher, said: “The surgeons at Leeds Infirmary saved Roux’s le. “It was completely against the odds that he survived. “There’s no way to describe or explain what they’ve done for us as family. “Everyone on Ward  was amazing. They treated us like family, they were incredible, their hearts are there. “It’s not just a job to them, they invest everything into their patients and the families. I’m forever thankful, and forever in their debt.” The tumour has left Roux blind in his left eye and around a year behind in his development, but his parents believe their “cheeky and happy” little lad, who is now  months old, will catch up.Amy, from Hessle, is now dedicated to raising awareness for Brain Tumour Research, and also wants other people to know what symptoms to look out for.She said: “One of the main symptoms of a brain tumour is headaches, but obviously, someone as young as Roux can’t tell youthey’ve got a headache.“Roux was sleeping much more than you’d expect, he was also really irritable, crying all the time and wouldn’t feed properly. “We did all the usual things like swapping bottles and at one point we thought he had colic. “But his swollen eye was a massive sign, especially when it started to get worse.” Just weeks after he was born, sensing something was seriously wrong, Roux’s parents rushed him to Hull Royal Infirmary where he had a CT scan. He was then taken by ambulance to Leeds General Infirmary for specialist treatment. “At first it didn’t register what was happening, I went into shock and real disbelief,” Amy said.  It was when Roux arrived at the Leeds hospital, he was officially diagnosed with a brain tumour. “Doctors found the tumour was behind his left eye and was cm,” Amy said. We were inconsolable. From there, Roux was rushed for emergency surgery, which they hoped would save his le. Roux’s operation, which lasted several hours, would turn out to be the first of ten surgeries the tiny tot would have to endure. During the first procedure, the neurosurgeon performed a biopsy, which revealed Roux’s tumour was a large, low-grade germ cell tumour . Roux’s tumour was so rare doctors could only find “one other identical case” of it anywhere in the world. Over the course of the next few weeks, Roux spent countless hours in the operating theatre, as surgeons worked tirelessly to try to remove more of the tumour each time.  Tragically, after the fth operation, his devastated parents were told it was possibly time to consider end of le care. “Roux wasn’t ready to give up and neither were we,” Amy said. Roux then had a sixth operation to fit a ventriculoperitonealshunt and to insert a Hickman line. In January had a seventh surgery to remove more of the tumour. The surgery was a success as shortly after surgeons informed the family of the brilliant news that there was “no tumour left”. But the good news was short-lived, as in March , Roux had a routine MRI scan, which found that the tumour had started to grow back.Roux’s eighth operation was on August , but, tragically afterwards, he was taken back to hospital after he contracted meningitis and his brain fluid became infected. Another surgery to remove his shunt followed, after which he had the External Drainfitted, to drain the excess fluid. Once the infection was gone, surgeons re-inserted the VP shunt, which was Roux’s tenth and most recent surgery. Finally, on October , which was also Roux’s first birthday, he was discharged. “Since then, Roux has gone from strength to strength,” Amy said. “The latest scan results show no evidence of any remaining tumour.” Roux is also undergoing regular physio sessions and seeing an occupational therapist. “He’s doing really well,” she said. “He’s standing and can walk with support. I sometimes feel sad for him, because he’s dying to walk and should be running around with his brother. “We don’t know his full prognosis yet. But because he had it so young, it is in his favour. His communication and social skills are great because heaposs had a lot of that. Itaposs his motor skills that he needs to catch up on, but heaposs doing really well. The family are now raising awareness for Brain Tumour Research, and have set-up a GoFundMe fundraising page to support the charity and the hospital ward that treated Roux.

Her Majesty, who it is reported had her second Covid vaccine dose shortly before this first engagement of , was marking the centenary of the Royal Australian Air Force . She paid tribute to the skill and sacrice of the RAAF during her first public engagement of the year outside Windsor Castle. During a service at the Commonwealth War Graves CommissionAir Forces Memorial in Runnymede, Surrey, the Queen commemorated the th anniversary of the RAAF. In a lighter moment, the Queen quizzed Squadron Leader Matthew Sander about his job as a fighter controller working with Typhoon jets and askedthey had been sent off to chase the Russians and was told Thataposs correct, maaposam, itaposs a lot of fun for us! Sending her best wishes and congratulations to the RAAF, she wrote in a foreword to the order of service: As one of the oldest air forces in the world, it is fitting to pay tribute to the efficiency, skill and sacrice of the men and women who have served in its ranks, in Australia and overseas, during the past  years. Throughout my reign, the Royal Australian Air Force has shown immense dedication to duty and has defended our freedom in many conflicts around the world. As she arrived at the memorial, which she opened in , the Queen highlighted how long it was since she had last been there. She added: Youaposve got a good day for it. Itaposs a very windy spot normally.  The ceremony began with a flypast by the Red Arrows, but with white smoke only instead of the familiar red, white and blue. As they do not normally perform at this time of year, their smoke pods are being serviced. During the service, a wreath was laid on behalf of the Queen by her new equerry, Major Thomas White. More than , men and women have served in the RAAF since its formation in , fighting in conflicts ranging from the Second World War to Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq, with more than , losing their lives in service. The event at Runnymede is the fourth royal engagement the Queen has attended beyond the walls of Windsor Castle since the pandemic began.  She has spent much of the pandemic shielding there in a bubble with husband Prince Philip, who recently spent nearly a month in hospital. She was last seen outside her Berkshire residence in November during the annual Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph and, a few days before that, wore a face mask in public for the first time during a poignant visit to the grave of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey to mark the centenary of his burial. A few weeks earlier she was joined by her grandson, the Duke of Cambridge, when she visited the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Porton Down, in Wiltshire and formally opened the Energetics Analysis Centre. The Queen has been carrying out her duties as head of state throughout the pandemic and has taken part in a number of memorable virtual royal engagements via video call, including one where she encouraged those who were hesitant to have the vaccine to think about other people rather than themselves.  A number of high-profile events have been staged in the grounds of Windsor Castle including a ceremony last summer where the Queen knighted veteran NHS fundraiser, Captain Sir Tom Moore. Australiaaposs High Commissioner, George Brandis, said in a speech that the RAAF was the second oldest independent air force in the world: The Royal Australian Air Force has, over these  eventful years, grown to be one of the most accomplished in the world. After the service, the Queen was shown the names of some of the , Australian war dead who are commemorated on a .

It comes as Bet reported a . per cent decline in revenue from its core sports and gaming business to £. billion. Pre-tax profit dropped  per cent to £ million. Ms Coates, aged , risked everything when she took out a £m loan to launch the firm from a portable cabin in a car park in . The family had run Provincial Racing betting shops but she saw the future online. She would later tell StokeLive in a rare interview: I was convinced early on that gambling would work well on the internet. It is private, accessible and allows you to present a huge range of betting opportunities to customers. For the first few years of the business, we still had betting shops, but, for me, although I had managed to build them into a really strong regional chain, we were always going to be signicantly smaller than the national chains. The internet gave us the opportunity to enter a new and international market where we had the possibility of being the best.  She added: I first came up with the idea when I was working in an office above one of our betting shops in Tunstall in the late s. One of the first key decisions was deciding to develop our own software rather than licensing a product. This meant we had to put a software development team together and that did indeed take shape in a portable building on a car park near one of our shops between Trentham and Longton. Soon we started to outgrow this and it was then we made our first move on to Festival Park in December .

And they are demanding tougher fines for those who leave areas strewn with bottles, cans, rotting food, wrappers and napkins. Parks, beaches and beauty spots looked more like tips over recent days as sunshine and the easing of lockdown brought revellers flocking. Clean Up Britain has called for littering fines to be raised from £ to £, – as council spend millions on cleaning up after crowds. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section Founder John Read said littering should become as socially unacceptable as drink driving. He added: “Britain is drowning under a tsunami of rubbish. “We’re enduring a ­horrendous health pandemic, but we’re also suffering from a litter and fly-tipping epidemic. Much tougher sentences are needed to deter fly-tipping and littering, which are costing local councils £million a year to clear up. “This is a horrendous waste of money.” Over the past few days, park bins have been left overflowing in London, Leeds, Bristol, Manchester and Brighton.  Similar scenes were found across the land as the “stay at home” rule ended and rule of six allowing groups to mix came back in. Mr Read branded those ­responsible for “personal pollution to the ­environment” selfish, irresponsible and lazy. And Mr Read revealed he received an email from a US travel company telling him they are now refusing to send tourists to the UK due to the mess.  It read: “Britain is by far the worst for litter, especially on roads. I’m sorry to say, you’ve lost our business.” Mr Read also wants parents or s of under-s to be finedtheir children are caught littering.  Charity Keep Britain Tidy’s deputy chief executive said: “Walking away from the debris after a picnic or sharing drinks with friends is not acceptable. It should be put in a bin and,there is no bin or the bin is full, it should be taken home with you. ­ Councils spend ­thousands of pounds dealing with littering, money that could be better spent on vital services.”  Chief executive Allison Ogden-Newton also warned of the dangers to wildle from litter. She said: “You can hear the birds tweeting, some of that muck will end up choking their young. They don’t know it isn’t food or nesting ­material.” About  million tons of litter is dropped every year, Keep Britain Tidy said. That is up % since the s. Food packaging or ­wrappers are the biggest mess. We back the campaign of InYourArea and Clean Up Britain for litterers to be punished more severely.

Scroll down for the vaccine queue calculator which shows when you may be able to get a jab Britain will focus on vaccinating the whole of its adult population before it can to provide any surplus shots to other countries such as its close neighbour Ireland, business minister Kwasi Kwarteng said on Tuesday. More than  million Britons have received their first Covid- shots in the fastest vaccine rollout in Europe, with the aim of offering shots to all adults by the end of July. However, Britain has found itself involved in a public spat with the European Union, where the vaccination programme has been much slower, over the supply of doses.  I think our focus has to be to try and keep Britain safe, we want to work cooperatively as well with other countries but the main priority is to get the vaccine rollout, Kwarteng told Sky News. He said Britain was working with European nations to try to ensure their populations were vaccinated, and that it was not a competitive situation. However, askedBritain might be able to help out Ireland, he said: If there are surplus vaccine doses then we can share them but there are no surpluses at the moment, we have still got a huge number to vaccinate.

According to a large study examining the Test and Trace system, just % of those with symptoms said they had requested a test, while only % with symptoms in the previous seven days adhered to full self-isolation. Men, younger people and those with young children were less likely to self-isolate as were those from more working-class backgrounds, people experiencing greater financial hardship, and those working in key sectors.Experts, including from the Public Health Englandbehavioural science team at Porton Down in Wiltshire, found that only half of people could identy the main coronavirus symptoms, which include a cough, high temperature and loss of taste or smell.The findings, published in The BMJ, are based on , responses to online surveys from , people aged  or older living in the UK. In total,  survey waves were carried out from March  last year to January  this year, with about , participants in each wave. The results showed that only % of people could identy the main symptoms of Covid- but this did not really improve as time went on. Across all waves, % of people adhered to rules around self-isolation, though this improved in January to %. Common reasons for not fully self-isolating included to go to the shops or work, for a medical need other than Covid-, to care for a vulnerable person, to exercise or meet others, or because symptoms were only mild or got better. Just % of people requested a Covid testthey had experienced symptoms in the previous seven days, despite around three times as many saying they intended to do sothey developed signs of coronavirus.  The study found that % wanted to share details of close contacts with NHS Test and Trace but there was some hesitancy around whether data was secure and confidential. There were also concerns whether the contact tracing system was accurate and reliable. The experts, including those from Kingaposs College London, said: With such low rates for symptom recognition, testing, and full self-isolation, the effectiveness of the current form of the UKaposs test, trace, and isolate system is limited. The team concluded: Levels of adherence to test, trace, and isolate are low, although some improvement has occurred over time. Practical support and financial reimbursement are likely to improve adherence.  Targeting messaging and policies to men, younger age groups, and key workers might also be necessary. In March, MPs on the Public Accounts Committee said the impact of NHS Test and Trace is still unclear, despite the UK Government setting aside £ billion for it over two years. Its report criticised an over-reliance on consultants, with some paid more than £, a day. It also questioned a failure to be ready for a surge in demand for tests last September, and NHS Test and Trace not meeting its target to turn around face-to-face tests within  hours. A study from the National Audit Officein December also criticised the scheme, saying it had not yet achieved its objectives.  The NAO said it was very important that testing and tracing is able to make a bigger contribution to suppressing the infection than it has to date. The latest Office for National Statisticsdata shows that % of those told they must self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace after being in contact with a positive Covid case did so. A Department for Health and Social Care spokesman said: Since last May, NHS Test and Trace has contacted . million people who tested positive, and another . million of their contacts. Behind these numbers are countless lives saved and the latest ONS figures show that when people are asked to self-isolate, the overwhelming majority do so. It is vital that people continue to do their bit by isolating when they are asked to.  As the prevalence of coronavirus falls, our testing and tracing system becomes more important in identying and supressing local outbreaks while also responding rapidly to the threat of new iants. Paulette Hamilton, vice chairwoman of the Local Government Associationaposs community wellbeing board, said: The findings of this study are concerning. Although the rollout of the vaccine is providing us with hope of ato our normal way of le, the responsibility on us all to get ourselves tested when necessary and share our contacts on request will be needed for some time to come, in order to keep case rates as low as possible. It is also critical that everyone does the right thing and self-isolates when required. Key to this is making sure people understand what self-isolation means, feel able to comply and are supported to do sonecessary. Skills minister Gillian Keegan has said that NHS Test and Trace was not a perfect system as it relied on people doing the right thing.

And the lting of Covid restrictions this week also means we can travel away from our local areas to find a beach or beauty spot.Last month Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK’s chief scientic adviser, told MPs that while the outdoors isn’t completely risk free “it is the case that it is dficult to see how things like large beach gatherings and so on can cause a spike” in coronavirus cases.But with tourist spots likely to be packed, what are the ways we can enjoy them as safely as possible  Here, Azeem Majeed, the head of the department of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, gives his ten top tips… Will you be getting out and about  Let us know in the comment section   Travel safely. If you are travelling by car, try to travel with people from your household or support bubble. If using public transport, make sure you wear a face mask. The best way to travel is by foot or bicycle but this won’t be practical for more distant locations.  Follow Covid- rules on how many people can meet. In England, you can currently meet with a maximum of five other peoplethey are from more than two other households. Make sure your total group size does not exceed six peoplethis is the case. If there are people from just two households meeting, then your group can be bigger than six people.  Keep your distance from other people. There will be many other people also out and about. Try to keep at least two metres away from others who are not in your groupthey will be near you for a prolonged period. The virus that causes Covid- spreads from person to person by droplets or through an aerosol. Outdoors, the virus will disperse quickly and the risk of infection is very lowyou are not near other people.  Don’t share food and drink. You should use separate cups, plates and utensils for each person present and not share them as sharing will increase the risk of infection. You should also avoid sharing food because this has been shown to increase the risk of infection.  Be aware of the greater risks in indoor spaces such as toilets. At some point, you may have to use to use a public toilet. The risk of infection is substantially higher in indoor spaces – particularlythey are crowded, used by lots of people and are poorly ventilated. Avoid coming into close contact with others while indoors. You should also wear a face mask or face covering, and wash or sanitise your hands before entering. After using the toilet, wash your hands thoroughly and go back outside immediately once you finish. Avoid touching surfaces. Surfaces such as hand rails will have been touched by many other people and will be contaminated. If you do touch a surface that many people have been in contact with, wash or sanitize your hands as soon as possible.  Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer regularly. This will remove any virus that you may have inadvertently picked up from a surface or from someone , and help to protect yourself and protect others.  Avoid alcohol. People are more likely to engage in behaviour and activity that increase their risk of infection when they are drinking."},{"url":null,"title":"hundreds gather rave manchester city","story":"NewsHundreds gather at rave in Manchester city centre - with mounds of rubbish left behindVideos show a large number of people ignoring social distancing measures to dance and drink in Castlefield Bowl in Manchester, before police arrived to break up the gatheringmirrorShareCommentsByRob WilliamsLorraine KingSteve Robson:,  APR NewsHundreds of revellers flocked to the rave \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

According to the MEN locals who live in canal boats in the area say gatherings are a regular occurrence but things got more ‘hectic’ this week. On Monday the easing of the lockdown rules means six people from two households are now allowed to meet outdoors in parks and private gardens but they must practice social distancing. The Government has also scrapped its aposstay at homeapos message.

Oliver was born with Downaposs Syndrome and suffers from other complicated health needs such as diabetes. Talking about his joy at ing to school today , his mum Katie Kelly, , from Alwoodley in Leeds, said: “He got dressed up in his unorm ready to go to school and sat in the hall. But it was four days too early. “It was Monday morning and his brother William, who is seven, was getting ready for school and Oliver thought he was going too. “He had his coat on, shoes on and bag packed, just waiting. He hadnapost even had his breakfast. “It was a battle because he was insisting most of the morning he was going. “He was disappointed when I explained it wasnapost until Thursday and stayed in his unorm for the whole day.” Katie says he has been waking up every morning and asking: “School ” “It has been dficult. Itaposs hard really. Iaposm still reserved about it because itaposs been a long time since heaposs been at school,” she said. “Itaposs nice that he is excited and heaposs been looking forward to going to see his friends. “He will be excited to play with the equipment they have there too.”. But Katie says he has missed family even more than his Boston Spa school.“The weather has been so bad, we have hardly seen them. He keeps askinghe can see his aunty and cousin and we explain we canapost because of aposthe bugsapos“The other day we went past the playground and had to explain again why we couldnapost go in there because of the aposbugsapos.” Oliver also missed out on his th birthday party celebrations. The entire family has had to make huge sacrfices to keep Oliver safe. His dad Richard Kelly, , had to temporarily give up work as a painter and decorator. He said: “We are a little bit freer and hopefully Oliver is going back to school full time after Easterit goes well on Thursday.” Richard has had to be “selective” about the jobs heaposs taken on fearing bringing the virus home. “Iaposve been off for three months but Iaposm trying to get back into it now and just be safe. “It has been really testing, and tricky because we take our other son to school but we are a bit unsure about Oliver going. “Itaposs always a worry for me bringing it in or my other son bringing it in. “ Although both Katie and Richard have been vaccinated as his carers, it could be several more months before Oliver gets a jab. aposI missed granddaughteraposs birthdays, it was heartbreakingapos  Multiple Sclerosis sufferer Cindy Vamplew, , has spent the last  months shielding at her home near Lincoln. During that time she and husband Michael, , have relied on their daughter to leave almost all their food inside the porch. The couple, who have three children and seven grandchildren, have only been able to see family through their garden window. Retired librarian Cindy said: Itaposs been very le-changing, Iaposve been virtually housebound for the whole  months. Iaposve missed my family so much and all those special occasions like birthdays and Christmas. In some ways itaposs very strange that from the st of April I will be able to do exactly the same as everyone . Iaposm not an anxious person but after so long in the house I think itaposs only natural that itaposs going to feel a bit strange to be outside.  Cindy, who relies on a wheelchair and frame to get around, stayed at home for three months solid during the first lockdown. When the country began opening up she left to attend some hospital appointments and even had her hair cut on a couple of occasions. Michael has also made two or three essential trips for food over the past year. But apart from this the couple have remained within the boundaries of their home and garden. Cindy, who lives near Lincoln, says not seeing her family has been the hardest aspect of shielding. She explained: I wasnapost able to be there for my youngest granddaughteraposs first or second birthdays, which was heartbreaking. Her th birthday celebrations last monthwere also dampened by heavy rain.

Hundreds of pupils held a protest in the school yard at Pimlico Academy in Westminster, central London, on Wednesday to call for the unorm policy and changes to aspects of the curriculum to be reversed. A new unorm policy ushered in by head teacher Daniel Smith last year, which stated that hairstyles that block the view of others would not be allowed and hijabs should not be too colourful, sparked agitation that came to a head on the last day of term. Students also claimed that there has been no recognition of Black Lives Matter or Black History Month and that concerns about the placement of the union jack flag have been repeatedly ignored. Now the headteacher has agreed to amend the unorm rules, take down the union jack flag and review the curriculum. He said the issue of flying the union flag was discussed atand says they have listened to concerns from students, parents and members of the community.  The headteacher told the Daily Mail: After Easter, we will conduct a review of this and, as part of that, consult with all the academyaposs stakeholders to elicit their feedback.In the meantime, and until that review is concluded, the union flag will not be flown at the academy. Mr Smith said the aposcurrent affairsapos aspect of the PSHE curriculum will now make sure students are able to discuss issues that are apostruly currentapos. He added: Sixth Form student representatives raised concerns about certain aspects of the academyaposs Unorm Policy - I was able to reassure students that their previous representations on these points had been the motivation for reflection which, in turn, resulted in revision to the relevant polices taking place.  Mr Smith praised his aposbright, courageous and intelligentapos students for being passionate about the things that matter to them. The Mirror has contacted the school for comment. Scores of pupils chanted we want change and walked out of school early on Wednesday, with police officers seen at the school grounds during the protests. In a statement posted online, students outlined their concerns, writing: We believe the school has unfairly targeted groups of students. The school should protect marginalised races, religions and other groups instead of target them. The academy placed new rules that would punish students with Afro hairstyles, clearly discriminating against Black students. The academy has faced further accusations of discrimination for saying hijabs must be black but other clothing can be any colour. This challenges young Muslim girls’ identity.

Diana is the highest profile former member of the monarchy to be bestowed the honour, and was nominated by the London Assembly after the body ran a campaign asking Londoners to suggest women worthy of a blue plaque. Anna Eavis, English Heritageaposs curatorial director, said the princessapos campaigns to highlight issues like HIV Aids and landmines - and her enduring appeal as an inspiration and cultural icon to many, were deciding factors. Dianaaposs parents bought her  Coleherne Court, a property in a mansion block close to the fashionable Kingaposs Road in Cha, when she settled in the capital as a young woman. She shared the flat with a number of girlfriends and was said to have a sign above her bedroom door which read Chief Chick. Diana described the few years she lived in the three-bed flat as the happiest time of her le, according to Andrew Mortonaposs book Diana, In Her Own Words. It was juvenile, innocent, uncomplicated and above all fun. I laughed my head off there, she said. When she began dating Charles, Diana was reportedly living with friends Anne Bolton and Virginia Pitman, was charging her flatmates £ a week and was said to be a house proud young woman who set up a cleaning rota.  The apartment was reportedly bought by her parents for £, when the princess - then Lady Diana Spencer - was  and working at Young England Kindergarten in Pimlico, central London. Ms Eavis said: Her profile and popularity remains undiminished nearly  years after she died and clearly a part of that was the ease with which she seemed to communicate with everybody.

The -year-oldaposs new two-bedroom apartment boasts floor-to-ceiling windows, two balconies and an open-plan living and dining room. The new pad in Grays, Essex, is a far cry from the four-bedroom house she currently shares with her two parents and three siblings in Stratford, east London.

Prescila, who recently graduated with a degree in Psychology from Northampton University, bought  tickets for £ - but says she didnapost expect to win because sheaposs never won anything in her le. She said: I always used to take part in raffles when I was kid but never won. Itaposs been so overwhelming. I havenapost had time to take it all in, Iaposve just had so many messages.

In the footage, shown to the jury at the murder trial of ex-police officer Derek Chauvin, Mr Floyd is heard to repeatedly tell police that he canapost breathe and says aposIaposm not a bad guy.apos Moments earlier one officer is seen to aim a gun at him and Mr Floyd appeared to start crying before begging not to be shot. Jurors watched the disturbing new bodycam footage for the first time as the murder trial continued on its third day on Wednesday. In one video clip Mr Floyd is heard to beg to officers and calls out aposIaposm not a bad guy.apos He is then seen to be shoved on to a police car seat as he pleads with police telling them he canapost breathe.  Minutes later he is brought down to the ground outside the police car where he repeats that he canapost breathe as officers restrain him. The footage goes on to show Mr Floyd being knelt on as he says a number of times: I love you mama and I canapost breathe. J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao, the other three law enforcement officers at the scene, are all facing aiding and abetting charges in connection with the case. Video recorded by Thomas Lane appeared to show the moments before the arrest with Mr Floyd begging not to be shot after an officer aimed a gun at him. Appearing to cry, Mr Floyd tells police: Please donapost shoot me, please, man. Please, man, I didnapost know. Later footage goes on to show the arrest with Mr Floyd being knelt on as he says a number of times: I love you mama and I canapost breathe. A scuffle broke out in the footage when police tried to get Mr Floyd into the back of the vehicle. He can be heard saying he is claustrophobic and has anxiety. As the police officers drag him out of the car and restrain him on the ground, Mr Floyd can be heard calling for his mother and telling his family he loves them. Mr Floydaposs death in the US last summer triggered protests around the world as Black Lives Matter demonstrators called for an end to racial injustice in the wake of the unarmed black manaposs death.  A trial into his alleged murder got under way on Monday with jurors hearing opening arguments and a number of witnesses. Chauvin, , denies second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. His lawyers are set to argue that he followed his training and that the main cause of Mr Floydaposs death - which the county examiner ruled a homicide - was a drug overdose. What  happened in the trial on Wednesday  Cashier almost didnapost tell his manager about fake note and feels guilty One of the last people to ever speak with Mr Floyd, a cashier at Cup Foods, wept as he described the deadly encounter with Chauvin. Christopher Martin accepted the  bill that triggered the fatal arrest.  The -year-old told jurors: I thought that George didnapost really know it was a fake bill. He said he considered letting his employer dock it from his wages but ended up telling his manager. Minutes later police were on scene arresting Mr Floyd on suspicion of passing a counterfeit. He went on to say he felt guilty and added: I thoughtI would not have taken the bill this would have been avoided. Footage from inside the store is played showing Mr Floyd smiling and animated Silent security-camera video was played showing Mr Floyd dressed in a black tank top approaching Cup Foodaposs counter with a banana in hand. He is seen smiling and making cheerful conversation and putting his arm around a woman. He seems to be filled with energy and constantly in motion, at one point almost dancing on the spot, shting his weight from one foot to the other.  Mr Martin told the jury that he made conversation with the slain man, asking himhe played baseball. aposHe did seem highapos Mr Floyd seemed to take time to find his words but did make replies, Mr Martin said. He seemed very friendly, approachable, he was talkative, he seemed to be having just an average Memorial Day, just living his le, he recalled. But he did seem high. Although the county medical examiner ruled Floydaposs death a homicide resulting from the police restraint, fentanyl and methamphetamine was found in his blood at autopsy. Chauvinaposs lawyers argue the death was really a drug overdose. aposYou canapost winapos Eyewitness Charles McMillan can be heard saying those words to Mr Floyd in videos of the arrest. The -year-old told the slain man to aposget up and get in the carapos to which Mr Floyd replied aposI canapostapos from beneath Chauvin. Mr McMillan told the jury: Once police get the cops on you, you canapost win, so Iaposm trying to tell him to just co-operate. After Mr Floydaposs limp body was loaded into an ambulance, Chauvin got into a police car, and Mr McMillan walked over.

Mr Martin added Mr Floyd was “high” when he came into the store at .pm on May  last year. He noted the -year-old was “big” and they talked about sport.The court was shown CCTV of Mr Floyd, who was described as being “friendly” at the time, laughing and putting an arm around a woman.Mr Martin, who lived above the store, alerted his manager about the note but when Mr Floyd refused to come back inside police were called. Previously, the jury was shown a video of the arrest that lasted nine minutes and  seconds.  In it Chauvin is seen digging his knee into Mr Floyd’s neck as he begs for his “mumma” and gasps he can’t breathe  times. The video of the fatal arrest sparked outrage and prompted global protests for racial justice and against police brutality. Before Wednesday’s hearing George Floyd’s cousin, Tera Brown, said it was “tormenting” seeing the video and hearing him moaning and begging for his le. “It’s honestly worse than any horror movie I’ve ever seen in my le so it’s dficult to watch,” she said. The court was shown CCTV footage of Mr Floyd in the store and he was described as being “friendly”. He is seen smiling and laughing and fondly putting an arm around what appears to be a female friend. Mr Martin, , said Mr Floyd came into the store at .pm on May th last year, to buy cigarettes. CCTV shows the shop worker taking Mr Floyd’s note and holding up to check it. “When I saw the bill I noticed it had a blue pigment to it, kinda how a  bill would have,” he said. “The policy was thatyou took a counterfeit bill you would have to pay for it out of your money or your pay cheque. “I took it anyways and I was planning just to put it on my tab until I second guessed myself.  “I kept examining it and I eventually told my manager. “He told us to go out to the vehicle and tell him to come inside and discuss what just happened. “The car the SUV that George Floyd was in. I could see it from where I was standing. I watched him walk to it.” He said there were three people in the car with George in the driver’s seat , another male in the passenger seat and a woman in the back.

Terrorism in West Africa was already the new frontline against global jihad, with  British among , UN troops on a peace-keeping missions there. In a separate struggle , French soldiers are involved in ferocious firefights against jihadists in the region and the security nightmare is spreading. French expert on jihad Olivier Guitta, from Global Risk Consultancy warned recently: “Africa is going to be the battleground of jihad for the next  years and it’s going to replace the Middle East.” Thousands of local troops from African countries are also engaged in the struggle to beat back the jhadists, whose numbers seem to grow by the day. Terrorism is already threatening the entire Sahel region of sub-Sahara Africa, with flashpoints in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger after migrating from Libya, Chad and further north all the way from the Middle East. But carnage also , miles away, in Palma, north Mozambique, in southern Africa, underlines a terrying expansion in terror attacks by Islamist terror groups across the entire continent. And though they appeared to be an ISIS-linked rabble, retired Colonel Lionel Dyck, whose private security company employees fought the insurgents, warned: “These were a dferent calibre of terrorist.” It is also feared the weapons they used, such as mortars, were brought in from neighbouring Tanzania and the fighters appeared battle-hardened and even trained. One security analyst said: “The problem is that once Islamic State was defeated in the Middle East and came to a halt in Libya its fighters had to migrate. “Many of them moved into Chad and Niger and gravitated across to Mali, exploiting ungoverned space and an insecure government in Mali to form bases. “Couple that with poverty, disaffected youth, civil wars and general dissatisfaction and you have an an ideal recruiting tool to attract very angry jihadists. “It almost doesn’t matterthey are Islamic State - there has been fluid movements between ISIS and al-Qaeda and all the other networks and jihad sub-franchisees.  “Some groups have even organised job-swaps, where you can do a kind of paid internship in another group to learn another form of guerilla terrorism. “And it is spreading, because as we have seen in Mozambique, weak local security forces mean unless a government is directly threatened they are unable to come down hard. “Andyou think it doesn’t affect Britain, then think again - we have a huge diaspora in the UK and it only takes one person to become enthused by jihad to launch an attack. “But it is also true to say that British firms have billions invested in oil companies and other financial interests across the continent.”  Experts also fear that many attacks, like the one in Mozambique, are sparked by local grievances from groups who then latch on to Islamic State and attract jihad fighters. This chilling clearing house system across swathes of Africa means groups “bleed” into neighbouring areas, gravitating towards the latest flashpoint. Sometimes they are paid to fight by local organisations but often the rewards of pillage and robbery are enough to encourage it, all in the name of their chosen form of militancy. Global warming has also created food shortages, water shortages, migration and crippling poverty, again driving poverty-stricken youths into the arms of the jihadi network.  A recent study by global risk researchers at Verisk Maplecroft discovered seven out of ten of the world’s most dangerous countries are now in Africa. Their report warns: “Violence in Africa’s terrorist hotspots is getting worse and the risk of attacks is rising in many countries across the region, including some previously considered safe. “The quarterly ranking of the  countries show sub-Saharan Africa is now home to seven of the worlds riskiest locations, making it the worst performing region globally.” The warning comes as in Mali, a multi-European force is backing local troops in the UN’s Operation Minusma as well as the French-led counter fighting missions Operation Barkhane.  British “ranger battalions” will be ready for deployment to train and fight alongside local forces against terror in Africa later this year in small, highly trained units. Hundreds of British mobile infantry are based in Gao, Mali, protecting locals in long-range desert patrols as French troops to the north are fighting ferocious battles against insurgents. And the past four years in countries such as Senegal, Kenya and Nigeria British troops have been training local forces how to fight the growing terror threat. Mali, Burkina Faso, Western Niger  Jamat at Nusrat al Islam Wal Muslimeenis a coalition of armed groups with al-Qaeda links but also connections to criminal gangs and truly deadly. This armed mob is responsible for around , attacks in the past year and the killing of around , people. This group has devastated the Sahel region. Also present in these three countries is Islamic State in West Africa, an offshoot from a split in Boko Haram in Nigeria and which encouraged locals to consider it a kind of “Boko lite” by being nicer to locals and concentrating more on military targets than civilians. Nigeria  Boko Haram- Means “westernisation is sacrilege.” An ISIS supporting lunatic insurgency, mostly locally funded through robbery, extortion, ransacking, kidnapping, taking over villages. Holding ground in the north east. Infamous for kidnapping hundreds of schoolgirls. It has killed more than , people and displaced more. Here there is also the splinter-group from Boko called ISIS in West Africa or ISWA, formed in  as a split-off from Boko and responsible for thousands of killings. Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania  Al-Shabaab, or “the young men” and one of the most deadly and well-established al-Qaeda sub-isions. Formed in Somalia in  it did not sign up to al-Qaeda for another six years and is behind large-scale and well-organised insurgent attacks such as the  Westgate Shopping Mall assault. They have spread into neighbouring Kenya and Tanzania. There are also fears they may have had a loose relationship with elements from Boko Haram. They have killed tens of thousands.

on Saturday and will be itching for another Championship match, but they’ll go into the Saints clash full of confidence and relish the opportunity to show what they’re all about.It’s a good chance for the Dark Blues to see where they’re at as they go up against top-quality Premiership opposition.It’ll be a tough afternoon for the Dee at Dens Park because Callum Davidson has his side purring at the moment.Over the past six months they’ve improved a lot, winning the Betfred Cup and dramatically securing a top-six finish, and look a really good side.Dundee season will get a #huge lt# from Dunfermline fightback says delighted boss James McPake\" title\"#Dundee season will get a #huge lt# from Dunfermline fightback says delighted boss James McPake# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-season-will-get-a-huge-lt-from-dunfermline-fightback-says-delighted-boss-james-mcpake embed # secretUdkzRS\" data-secret\"UdkzRS\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"I think Dundee can give them a few issues, though,they can get their best creative players on the ball and get at them.The Perth men will be the big favourites to win but, with it being a Tayside derby, it should be quite an open game.If they were to get to the play-offs and be up against a Premiership team, James McPake will be using this as an opportunity to see what kind of quality they#d face and where his team are at.Dundee have got a good enough squad for the play-offs, they’re really inconsistent but, on their day, they’ve proven against the likes of Hearts and the Pars at the weekend they can boss good teams.It’ll be interesting to see how the manager goes about it because, obviously, the league is the main focus and they’ve been going well.Does he look to keep that momentum going or does he try to give boys like Charlie Adam game time I think he’ll make a couple of changes.Whatever happens, though, securing second spot is still the top priority.They showed good character in fighting back from two goals downto pick up a crucial three points against promotion rivals Dunfermline.They couldn’t have gotten off to a worse start and it felt like they were going back to square one.However, Dundee are clearly fighting for their manager and each other. Fair play to them for that.They were the better team after going two down and the rest of the game was actually a really good performance.The defending will still be worrying McPake and the coaching staff but the fact they’ve dug deep, battled and have found a decent balance will please them.They create a lot of chances and cause teams problems.Lee Ashcroft is flying right now and looking really dangerous at every set-piece, Danny Mullen added a spark and both wingers, Paul McMullan and Declan McDaid, were excellent.Long may it continue.We’ve seen in the past how success in cup competitions can spur on a club like Dundee United.With little left to play for in the Premiership, putting a lot of focus and importance on having a good run in the Scottish Cup could benefit the Terrors in the long run.I know that’s what happened in my time at the club when we made the  League Cup Final and then won the Scottish in .The club then had a successful period off the back of that, regularly making the top six, European football and contesting big semi-final and final clashes.That’s, obviously, where the Tangerines want to be again in the future.For the here and now, though, the focus has to be on dealing with Partick Thistle.When the League One Jags come to Tannadice on Saturday, United will be in the unusual position of being huge favourites.It’s not something they’ll have been used to in recent times after ing to the top flight this season but I’m sure boss Micky Mellon will have them well prepared.They struggled in the Betfred Cup group stages earlier in the season, particularly when they lost to Peterhead, when they were in that strange position of being the favourites.They’re a dferent team now, though. They look a lot more confident and,they play like we know they can, they’ll have no problems.Despite two draws to open their World Cup qualying campaign, I still feel Scotland have it all to play forthey can get big results.It was going to be a tough ask from day one, and not winning in Israel on Sunday night doesn’t help the situation, because you can see how tight the group is going to be.Denmark and Austria are, obviously, good teams and Israel, credit to them, are a decent side.They showed that in the first half in Tel-Aviv in the - ide.I do, however, feel Scotland made them look better than they are and showed a little too much respect.We sat off and can’t do that again.SCOTLAND ANALYSIS: The aggression has gone, get Allan McGregor in for the Euros and World Cup hopes are hanging by a thread\" title\"#SCOTLAND ANALYSIS: The aggression has gone, get Allan McGregor in for the Euros and World Cup hopes are hanging by a thread# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp sport football international  scotland-world-cup-steve-clarke-allan-mcgregor embed # secretmeXxqLMc\" data-secret\"meXxqLMc\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\" vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/Runrig-1990-10-21_01-CAJL_38423208-814x564.jpg ","title":"the night runrig had a top of the pops dressing room argy bargy with oasis","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remWhen Runrig played Top Of The Pops alongside Diana Ross they were told not to make eye contact with or even look at the soul a# so they had a dressing room wall-banging argy-bargy with rock bad boys Oasis instead.“Oasis had the dressing room next door to us and they were playing a mix of Roll With It on repeat all the time, all throughout the afternoon and evening, to the point we were just fed up with it”, said Rory Macdonald, founder member of the iconic Scottish band, as was his brother Calum.“So we started banging the wall and shouting ‘shut up’ and they started the same. We met them outside and we were both saying ‘what’s all that racket’… but it was all fun, just banter back.”“The same time, Diana Ross was performing, but there was not a chance of banter with her, because we were told in advance that when she came in with her entourage, nobody was to look at her or make any eye contact. That was a totally dferent thing.It’s one of many memories Rory has of Runrig’s astonishing career spanning  years from their early days as a Skye ceilidh dance band to their triumphant farewell concerts – The Last Dance #  at Stirling Castle in front of , over two unforgettable nights in .That career is being celebrated in a special weekend of programmes about Runrig on BBC Alba from Friday, charting the rise of Scotland’s most successful folk and rock bands, who played arenas around the the world from New York’s Times Square to Edinburgh Castle. It will include the full version of The Last Dance concert film, capturing the band’s fond farewell.While Runrig’s roots are firmly fixed in the village halls of Skye, their debut gig was actually in one of Scotland’s most prestigious venues – Glasgow’s Kelvin Hall.“I stress at asuite within the Kelvin Hall,” said Rory, explaining their first concert was at a dinner dance.“Calum was a student in Glasgow and I was working as a graphic designer in  and we had a flat on the north side of the city. Round the corner was a family from Skye, the Douglases, of which Blair, their son, was an accomplished accordionist,” said Rory, who played guitar in another band before.“We used to go round there on Sunday nights for dinner. Blair’s mum, Ina, was the organiser of the North Uist and Berneray Gaelic Society in Glasgow and they were doing a dinner dance and looking for a band.”Ina suggested Rory and Blair put something together so they had a few sessions, with Calum, then a non-musician, sitting watching. But Calum started tapping away on the side of his chair as they played.“The sound seemed to be getting louder as the session progressed to the point where I turned to Calum and said: ‘Are you trying to tell us something here… are you trying to say you could do the drums ’ He said ‘yes’, so Calum was sent down to Biggars Music in Glasgow and bought a second-hand drum kit and that was it.”Rory said the three of them managed to pull off the gig.Something good happened that night, in spite of our rawness and being ill-equipped to do the task.#“Something good happened that night, in spite of our rawness and being ill-equipped to do the task, but that was it, that was the start. Small beginnings.”From there, the band decanted back to their native Skye – with Rory giving up his job as a graphic designer – so they could start to carve a musical career.“There was a circuit established on Skye and the West Coast for dancing. Every night of the week at that time in the s there would be a dance on at the village hall and a big demand for local bands,” he said.“After the success of the Kelvin Hall gig, we thought we would do more of this. We had that first summer on Skye and it went really well. There was a good chemistry between us and it established that was what we wanted to do.”Rory said anyone with visions of those early gigs as being like the ceilidh scene in Local Hero wouldn’t be short of the mark.“Everybody in the community would come out, of all ages. It wasn’t just confined to teenagers or young folk. Very much a family feeling. There would be half time and a room down the back where everyone could get tea and sandwiches… drinking took place in the toilets or outside,” said Rory, laughing.In their second year, the band decided they needed a singer.Donnie Munro joined and the band slowly grew, building up a following, particularly among students.As they became better known on the island circuit, the band wanted to branch out to the mainland, starting with the Highlands. But it was a path they had to beat for themselves, as they established their credentials as a Celtic rock act.“One of the biggest stepping stones was when we hired out Eden Court Theatre in Inverness in about , after Malcolm Jones joined us,” said Rory.Very few promoters were interested in taking us on, because they didn’t see this music as travelling well.#“Very few promoters were interested in taking us on, because they didn’t see this music as travelling well or going to Glasgow, Aberdeen or Edinburgh, it wouldn’t even get close. Inverness wasn’t interested in taking us on themselves, so we hired the place out. And we sold it out to the management’s astonishment, relying a lot on the young Gaels from the islands living in Inverness.”So the template was set for gigs across the rest of Scotland, including Aberdeen and Dundee, bringing their unique sound and mix of songs in both English and Gaelic to a wider audience.“We replicated that model in the cities, moving on a few years and promoting our own gigs in Glasgow and Edinburgh, until a point where the promoters began to notice and they came knocking on the door. But it took a long time to break down those doors.“But we were passionate about it. Calum and I were writing songs all through this period and we knew it was something we wanted to do with our lives.”The promoters were going round the bars offering freebies for people to come along.#Not that it was all plain sailing. Some early Runrig gigs saw them playing to a handful of people – including one night in Arbroath where only  people turned up at Smokey’s nightclub.“I don’t think the thing was advertised andwere going round the bars offering freebies for people to come along,” said Rory.To make matters worse, the  gig saw the band staying in the worst hotel anyone in the band could remember – up to and including bedbugs.But Rory reckons a Dornoch gig trumped even the Arbroath debacle.“That was the lowest in the late s. The local promoter had forgotten to advertise it. We had five people. Many years later in  we performed in a marquee on Dornoch Links and had , people there.”For all those duff gigs, the rise of Runrig was unstoppable, mostly driven on by word of mouth, said Rory.“We did find that once people were exposed to our music, they liked it. And people like the underground word-of-mouth thing, watching a band they like starting to develop and grow and audience. But it did take a long time.”In  their fth studio album, The Cutter And The Clan, found them a wider audience and launched a decade of Runrig finding success in both the UK albums and singles charts.Their live performances brought them even more success and more fans – with their legendary gig at Loch Lomond in  cementing the band’s place in the mainstream, said Rory.“That was probably the most visible result of getting into the mainstream in Scotland,” said Rory.It was a fitting venue, given how inextricably linked Runrig are with their iconic take on the traditional song, Loch Lomond, now a Scottish anthem.“It’s to the extent now that virtually every wedding you go to they sing it at the end,” said Rory.Runrig first performed Loch Lomond in , but Rory had it in his head long before that, having heard it on Radio Luxembourg in the s on a programme called Scottish Requests, aired on a Friday night.“The family would sit round and all work would stop and we would listen. It had the usual, Robin Wilson, Kenneth McKellar and all these sort of artists. I heard Robin Wilson singing Loch Lomond and I had always loved that song and it always stuck with me.“After Donnie joined the band I said we should do a version of Loch Lomond, I have this idea to make it sound more contemporary. So we started to perform it. is one of these songs where the hair stands up on the back of your neck.##There was one night we played it at a wedding in the Royal Hotel in Ullapool. That was the first time we noticed something turned with the audience and their reaction to it.“After we finished the gig I remember saying to Donnie: ‘Did you notice who the audience reacted ’ and he had.#There was something in the song I had felt from way back, that was impacting on people. I get it. It’s one of these songs where the hair stands up on the back of your neck.“The melody and the bitter-sweet lyric, really impacts on Scots. That’s the secret of the song.”Runrig have frequently played Aberdeen, all through their career.We started playing places like Ritzy’s,  the audience was close to the stage and they were hot and sweaty gigs.#“We started playing places like Ritzy’s, it was a club and the audience was close to the stage and they were hot and sweaty gigs. They were memorable nights because you had the sense the band was happening and there was chat about ‘ you carry on like this you’ll be playing the Capitol soon’.“Then we did play the Capitol. We had fantastic gigs at the Capitol. That sort of thing energized us. We realised the band was on the up. Aberdeen was a favourite stamping ground.”Rory also has fond memories of playing in Dundee, particularly similarly sweaty, thrilling gigs at the university, with the same vibe as Aberdeen’s Ritzy’s“We did a couple of gigs at Fat Sam’s and then we moved up to the Caird Hall. That just became a go to on the circuit. We played there at least once a year, particularly at Christmas. It was a really favourite venue for us.”In  Donnie left to go into politics and the band welcomed Canadian Bruce Guthro, who fitted in seamlessly. Keyboard player, Pete Wishart also made the move into politics, now an SNP MP for Perth.The much-loved band continued to gather acclaim and new fans, especially across North America and played a triumphant th anniversary concert at Stirling Castle in , establishing themselves as Scottish national treasures. And in , they celebrated their th anniversary with a gig on the Black Isle.We felt we had kind of done it and come to a point where we wanted to go out on a positive. And it felt right.#However, after the release of their th album, The Story, in they announced they were retiring from studio recording, then in  announced their final tour, The Final Mile.“I think it was a wise decision,” said Rory. “We’ve always relied on instinct and we felt this was the right time. It’s important that bands keep the music and creativity fresh. We felt we had kind of done it and come to a point where we wanted to go out on a positive. And it felt right.”It all culminated in August , with The Last Dance at Stirling Castle. Tickets for the two gigs sold out in minutes. It was an ecstatic night, that saw Donnie Munro back on stage with the band in front of a sea of adoring, chanting, singing fans.It was, according to Rory, the stand out memory of his  years with Runrig.“The fact we made it that long, lasted  years and had the success and for this final show, we carried it through. There was just something special about that whole experience of saying goodbye to the fans, of just saying farewell.”In a way it’s ing to where the band started # the islands and the West Coast.#And he’s delighted to see BBC Alba showing the gig – along with other special programmes about the band – over the weekend.“In a way it’s ing to where the band started, the BBC channel was set up to serve the Gaelic community and that’s where the early years of the band took place, the islands and the West Coast.” vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"brush-britains-marilyn-dream-come-true-glasgow-teen","story":"IT IS no wonder teenage boy Iain Henderson thought he was dreaming back in Glasgow in ."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering-reverend-effie-irvine-pioneering-woman-minister-made-scottish-history","story":" Reverend Effie Irvine made history when she became the first woman minister appointed to a parish in Scotland.

These efforts will inform the proposals for discussion with John Lewis on Tuesday.”John Lewis announced last week that it is considering the permanent closure of its city store – with around  workers expected to lose their jobs.A petition to keep the store has reached nearly , signatures although John Lewis has said a final decision on the store has yet to be made.Meanwhile, a member of John Lewis staff has said they are “gutted” that the city centre store may not open its doors again.In a letter written to the Evening Express, Eleanor Heptinstall said she hopes bosses can find a way to give the department store’s George Street premises a future.She said: “I am a partner at the John Lewis Aberdeen store –we are all gutted that our store may not open again.“John Lewis Aberdeen plays a key role in attracting shoppers from Aberdeenshire, Inverness, the Highlands  Islands and even Norway to Aberdeen.“Our presence, in turn, assists small businesses, the local hospitality and leisure industries and communities in Aberdeenshire.“I myself moved to Aberdeen to study, as I used to work at Waitrose. What attracted me was being able to move within the John Lewis Partnership, to Aberdeen to assist me through university.“Many students look for a richness in academic quality, shopping destinations, leisure and cultural activities when looking for a suitable university.”“We all hope that the JLP executives change their minds, butnot, we hope we have left a lasting legacy to Aberdeen and that the city revitalises.”Jamie Wishart, head of branch for John Lewis Aberdeen, said: “Our store has been at the heart of the city since , with generations of partners serving our customers in Aberdeen with pride and passion.“I know, having talked to many of our customers over my time here, how dearly loved our shop is and how disappointing news of the proposed closure will be. I would like to thank them for all their support and loyalty.”John Lewis has been a stalwart store in Aberdeen’s city centre since it opened its doors in .With its distinctive, stepped concrete exterior, the branch on George Street has been a popular shopping destination for more than three decades.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"  "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/03/PGX-250321-01-002_38359447-846x564.jpg ","title":"save our stores john lewis is a big draw in attracting students to aberdeen","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remHaving a John Lewis in Aberdeen puts us on a par with other bigger cities in Scotland and is a big draw for attracting students, according to an Aberdeen university social scientist.Dr Heather Morgan is a lecturer in applied health sciences and social scientist who worked in the city#s John Lewis for five and a half years while studying.She described how important the department store is to Aberdeen, especially amongst the student population, acting as a #familiar# face to people moving up to the north-east.Ms Morgan said: #I think John Lewis is huge to Aberdeen, it puts us on the map, along with Glasgow and Edinburgh.#In terms of the university, attracting students to come to Aberdeen, it plays a big part in terms of some coming from further afield than locally.#Having that brand name in Aberdeen is an important factor. Aberdeen is quite far up north, it#s far away from everyone , it#s quite a big move to make but having a name like John Lewis it makes it not feel as far away, it puts us on the map.#It#s a big employer, a lot of students can go to John Lewis on placement, so it#s a big part of the community there.#We don#t have any other department stores here anymore and it is important to have that one-stop shop andwe lose this, it will be very sad.#For people relocating, it can be quite a big thing to have a John Lewis in the city and when you are trying to attract people up here, it is definitely a draw.#Ms Morgan has many fond memories of working in the store between  and , and made a lelong friend while travelling to work on the train from Stonehaven.A fellow colleague started up a conversation with her after spotting her badge, and they are still friends today.Ms Morgan said: #I absolutely loved working there, there was a fantastic community spirit, there were other students there from the city and it was such a vibrant place, with a good atmosphere and good social element as well.#It was a great place to meet local people and be part of something, I was proud to be part of it, working in the city and with the brands I grew up with, I#m from Kent originally so I knew John Lewis in Milton Keynes so loved working there.#I learned so many interpersonal skills there as it was such a nice place to work.#John Lewis helped me settle into Aberdeen when I moved here and starting working there as I was mixing with people all dferent ages from the city, and felt like I became part of the city.#The -year-old has lived in Aberdeenshire since she was  and backed our campaign to save the store from closure.She added: #We need the profile of John Lewis being in Aberdeen, we don#t need another empty building of that size.#I don#t knowJohn Lewis#s mind has been fixed, orits too late to save it, but we need to try and convince them that it is financially viable to keep open.#Local people need to get involved and pledge to put their money where their mouth is, we need to really do something as a community, and the councillors to show them the wider picture of the economy.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"

were due to meet bosses at John Lewis today in a bid to convince the retail giant to remain in Aberdeen.Last week the chain announced plans to close the branch on George Street – the northernmost in the UK and the only Scottish store outside the central belt.The closure of the outlet would lead to the loss of  jobs, although any final decision on its future would be subject to a consultation with staff.Yesterday we revealed a taskforce – including council leaders and key figures in Aberdeen’s business scene – had been set up to lobby the chain to keep the store open.It was due to meet with bosses at John Lewis for the first time earlier today.Aberdeen City Council co-leader Douglas Lumsden, who along with fellow administration chiefs Jenny Laing and Marie Boulton sits on the taskforce, said he hoped recent “big announcements” regarding investment in the city would be taken into account.“There have been a lot of big announcements in Aberdeen recently,” Mr Lumsden said.“There is the energy transition zone and the energy transition fund from the government.“As a local authority we have also pledged £ million into city centre redevelopment as well so there is a lot going on and we want to make sure John Lewis are aware of all the good things going on in the local economy before making a final decision.“In the whole of the north region our earnings are still above average. We might have had a tough couple of years but we do see some good signs for the future and it would be goodJohn Lewis were part of that.“I understandsomeone from John Lewis was just looking at the numbers and is only seeing sales falling, but we would urge them to look at the bigger picture and the investment coming to the area. We hope they would take all that into consideration before making a final decision.”It is understood a key issue for the retailer is the size of the outlet, with bosses at John Lewis believing they do not need , square feet of space.However, the taskforce is keen to explore alternatives that could entice the retailer to reconsider its decision.One possibility being considered is that of opening a smaller John Lewis branch, along with a Waitrose store, either within the same building or in another location in the city centre.However, that option would require vehicle access and parking.Eventhe outlet does close down, John Lewis would still need to pay business rates and other costs such as security, since it is the owner of the building.The taskforce sees the branch as vital not just for Aberdeen, but for the whole of the north of Scotland, with the city as a whole viewed as a shopping hub for people in Aberdeenshire, Moray and the Highlands.One of the major fears among members of the group is a “domino” effect, where other businesses in the city close as a result of John Lewis’ withdrawal from Aberdeen.A petition calling for the retailer to rethink its proposal has gained more than , signatures since it was set up last week.Adrian Watson, chief executive of Aberdeen Inspired, said: “We had a detailed meeting between Aberdeen City Council leaders and other business organisation leads and we now carry this strong collective will to the table.#It was lost on no one what John Lewis partnership’s presence in Aberdeen means to the city and indeed the wider north of Scotland.“For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"  "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/Runrig-1990-10-21_01-CAJL_38423208-814x564.jpg ","title":"the night runrig had a top of the pops dressing room argy bargy with oasis","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remWhen Runrig played Top Of The Pops alongside Diana Ross they were told not to make eye contact with or even look at the soul a# so they had a dressing room wall-banging argy-bargy with rock bad boys Oasis instead.“Oasis had the dressing room next door to us and they were playing a mix of Roll With It on repeat all the time, all throughout the afternoon and evening, to the point we were just fed up with it”, said Rory Macdonald, founder member of the iconic Scottish band, as was his brother Calum.“So we started banging the wall and shouting ‘shut up’ and they started the same. We met them outside and we were both saying ‘what’s all that racket’… but it was all fun, just banter back.”“The same time, Diana Ross was performing, but there was not a chance of banter with her, because we were told in advance that when she came in with her entourage, nobody was to look at her or make any eye contact. That was a totally dferent thing.It’s one of many memories Rory has of Runrig’s astonishing career spanning  years from their early days as a Skye ceilidh dance band to their triumphant farewell concerts – The Last Dance #  at Stirling Castle in front of , over two unforgettable nights in .That career is being celebrated in a special weekend of programmes about Runrig on BBC Alba from Friday, charting the rise of Scotland’s most successful folk and rock bands, who played arenas around the the world from New York’s Times Square to Edinburgh Castle. It will include the full version of The Last Dance concert film, capturing the band’s fond farewell.While Runrig’s roots are firmly fixed in the village halls of Skye, their debut gig was actually in one of Scotland’s most prestigious venues – Glasgow’s Kelvin Hall.“I stress at asuite within the Kelvin Hall,” said Rory, explaining their first concert was at a dinner dance.“Calum was a student in Glasgow and I was working as a graphic designer in  and we had a flat on the north side of the city. Round the corner was a family from Skye, the Douglases, of which Blair, their son, was an accomplished accordionist,” said Rory, who played guitar in another band before.“We used to go round there on Sunday nights for dinner. Blair’s mum, Ina, was the organiser of the North Uist and Berneray Gaelic Society in Glasgow and they were doing a dinner dance and looking for a band.”Ina suggested Rory and Blair put something together so they had a few sessions, with Calum, then a non-musician, sitting watching. But Calum started tapping away on the side of his chair as they played.“The sound seemed to be getting louder as the session progressed to the point where I turned to Calum and said: ‘Are you trying to tell us something here… are you trying to say you could do the drums ’ He said ‘yes’, so Calum was sent down to Biggars Music in Glasgow and bought a second-hand drum kit and that was it.”Rory said the three of them managed to pull off the gig.Something good happened that night, in spite of our rawness and being ill-equipped to do the task.#“Something good happened that night, in spite of our rawness and being ill-equipped to do the task, but that was it, that was the start. Small beginnings.”From there, the band decanted back to their native Skye – with Rory giving up his job as a graphic designer – so they could start to carve a musical career.“There was a circuit established on Skye and the West Coast for dancing. Every night of the week at that time in the s there would be a dance on at the village hall and a big demand for local bands,” he said.“After the success of the Kelvin Hall gig, we thought we would do more of this. We had that first summer on Skye and it went really well. There was a good chemistry between us and it established that was what we wanted to do.”Rory said anyone with visions of those early gigs as being like the ceilidh scene in Local Hero wouldn’t be short of the mark.“Everybody in the community would come out, of all ages. It wasn’t just confined to teenagers or young folk. Very much a family feeling. There would be half time and a room down the back where everyone could get tea and sandwiches… drinking took place in the toilets or outside,” said Rory, laughing.In their second year, the band decided they needed a singer.Donnie Munro joined and the band slowly grew, building up a following, particularly among students.As they became better known on the island circuit, the band wanted to branch out to the mainland, starting with the Highlands. But it was a path they had to beat for themselves, as they established their credentials as a Celtic rock act.“One of the biggest stepping stones was when we hired out Eden Court Theatre in Inverness in about , after Malcolm Jones joined us,” said Rory.Very few promoters were interested in taking us on, because they didn’t see this music as travelling well.#“Very few promoters were interested in taking us on, because they didn’t see this music as travelling well or going to Glasgow, Aberdeen or Edinburgh, it wouldn’t even get close. Inverness wasn’t interested in taking us on themselves, so we hired the place out. And we sold it out to the management’s astonishment, relying a lot on the young Gaels from the islands living in Inverness.”So the template was set for gigs across the rest of Scotland, including Aberdeen and Dundee, bringing their unique sound and mix of songs in both English and Gaelic to a wider audience.“We replicated that model in the cities, moving on a few years and promoting our own gigs in Glasgow and Edinburgh, until a point where the promoters began to notice and they came knocking on the door. But it took a long time to break down those doors.“But we were passionate about it. Calum and I were writing songs all through this period and we knew it was something we wanted to do with our lives.”The promoters were going round the bars offering freebies for people to come along.#Not that it was all plain sailing. Some early Runrig gigs saw them playing to a handful of people – including one night in Arbroath where only  people turned up at Smokey’s nightclub.“I don’t think the thing was advertised andwere going round the bars offering freebies for people to come along,” said Rory.To make matters worse, the  gig saw the band staying in the worst hotel anyone in the band could remember – up to and including bedbugs.But Rory reckons a Dornoch gig trumped even the Arbroath debacle.“That was the lowest in the late s. The local promoter had forgotten to advertise it. We had five people. Many years later in  we performed in a marquee on Dornoch Links and had , people there.”For all those duff gigs, the rise of Runrig was unstoppable, mostly driven on by word of mouth, said Rory.“We did find that once people were exposed to our music, they liked it. And people like the underground word-of-mouth thing, watching a band they like starting to develop and grow and audience. But it did take a long time.”In  their fth studio album, The Cutter And The Clan, found them a wider audience and launched a decade of Runrig finding success in both the UK albums and singles charts.Their live performances brought them even more success and more fans – with their legendary gig at Loch Lomond in  cementing the band’s place in the mainstream, said Rory.“That was probably the most visible result of getting into the mainstream in Scotland,” said Rory.It was a fitting venue, given how inextricably linked Runrig are with their iconic take on the traditional song, Loch Lomond, now a Scottish anthem.“It’s to the extent now that virtually every wedding you go to they sing it at the end,” said Rory.Runrig first performed Loch Lomond in , but Rory had it in his head long before that, having heard it on Radio Luxembourg in the s on a programme called Scottish Requests, aired on a Friday night.“The family would sit round and all work would stop and we would listen. It had the usual, Robin Wilson, Kenneth McKellar and all these sort of artists. I heard Robin Wilson singing Loch Lomond and I had always loved that song and it always stuck with me.“After Donnie joined the band I said we should do a version of Loch Lomond, I have this idea to make it sound more contemporary. So we started to perform it. is one of these songs where the hair stands up on the back of your neck.##There was one night we played it at a wedding in the Royal Hotel in Ullapool. That was the first time we noticed something turned with the audience and their reaction to it.“After we finished the gig I remember saying to Donnie: ‘Did you notice how the audience reacted ’ and he had.#There was something in the song I had felt from way back, that was impacting on people. I get it. It’s one of these songs where the hair stands up on the back of your neck.“The melody and the bitter-sweet lyric, really impacts on Scots. That’s the secret of the song.”Runrig have frequently played Aberdeen, all through their career.We started playing places like Ritzy’s,  the audience was close to the stage and they were hot and sweaty gigs.#“We started playing places like Ritzy’s, it was a club and the audience was close to the stage and they were hot and sweaty gigs. They were memorable nights because you had the sense the band was happening and there was chat about ‘ you carry on like this you’ll be playing the Capitol soon’.“Then we did play the Capitol. We had fantastic gigs at the Capitol. That sort of thing energized us. We realised the band was on the up. Aberdeen was a favourite stamping ground.”Rory also has fond memories of playing in Dundee, particularly similarly sweaty, thrilling gigs at the university, with the same vibe as Aberdeen’s Ritzy’s“We did a couple of gigs at Fat Sam’s and then we moved up to the Caird Hall. That just became a go-to on the circuit. We played there at least once a year, particularly at Christmas. It was a real favourite venue for us.”In  Donnie left to go into politics and the band welcomed Canadian Bruce Guthro, who fitted in seamlessly. Keyboard player, Pete Wishart also made the move into politics, now an SNP MP for Perth.The much-loved band continued to gather acclaim and new fans, especially across North America and played a triumphant th-anniversary concert at Stirling Castle in , establishing themselves as Scottish national treasures. And in , they celebrated their th anniversary with a gig on the Black Isle.We felt we had kind of done it and come to a point where we wanted to go out on a positive. And it felt right.#However, after the release of their th album, The Story, they announced they were retiring from studio recording, then in  announced their final tour, The Final Mile.“I think it was a wise decision,” said Rory. “We’ve always relied on instinct and we felt this was the right time. It’s important that bands keep the music and creativity fresh. We felt we had kind of done it and come to a point where we wanted to go out on a positive. And it felt right.”It all culminated in August , with The Last Dance at Stirling Castle. Tickets for the two gigs sold out in minutes. It was an ecstatic night, that saw Donnie Munro back on stage with the band in front of a sea of adoring, chanting, singing fans.It was, according to Rory, the stand out memory of his  years with Runrig.“The fact we made it that long, lasted  years and had the success and for this final show, we carried it through. There was just something special about that whole experience of saying goodbye to the fans, of just saying farewell.”In a way it’s ing to where the band started # the islands and the West Coast.#And he’s delighted to see BBC Alba showing the gig – along with other special programmes about the band – over the weekend.“In a way it’s ing to where the band started, the BBC channel was set up to serve the Gaelic community and that’s where the early years of the band took place, the islands and the West Coast.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/03/shutterstock_1708218922-e1617012612218-300x180.jpg class=attachment-part-medium size-part-medium wp-post-image ","title":"covid vaccine in scotland track the rollout progress with these charts","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remWith the Covid- vaccination programme now under way, we#ve put together a collection of Covid vaccine tracker charts to monitor the progress of the Covid- vaccine rollout across the UK.How many people have been vaccinated How many people have received the vaccine in my area Which demographics have received the vaccine When will I receive my coronavirus vaccine The Covid vaccine tracker below shows an at-a-glance view of the current proportion of the Scottish population who have received the first and second dose of either the Oxford AstraZaneca or the Pfizer BioNTech vaccination so far.The table below is an at-a-glance view of the total figures by group.Data on the number of people vaccinated was initially provided in a weekly report from Public Health Scotland, however there was immense pressure to keep the public more regularly informed so on January  the statistics began to be provided each day.The chart below shows the daily numbers of first and second doses provided.The chart below shows the cumulative number of people who have received each dose since the vaccination programme began on December .It#s also helpful to look at this data as a proportion of the Scottish population so you can see how the percentage of people vaccinated grows over time.The chart below shows the progress for each UK country.On January , Public Health Scotland provided this data broken down by vaccine type which is shown in the chart below.The map below shows the available data on the regional rollout of the vaccination programme.January  saw the release of data by local authority area for the first time, which is shown in the map below.Regional data was originally available on a weekly basis but moved to a daily upload on February .

Options! There is only one possible and that should be obvious.When I first moved to Argyll, driving through Glen Croe was a beautul feeling that I had left the urban areas behind and come out into fresh country. No longer # it is a disaster zone and will remain so for a number of years, and possibly decades,a new  safe road is not built.With the elections in May for the Scottish Government, we should be calling on our  politicians to deliver a suitable road through Glen Croe and to do it soon, not  years  away with no firm plans to do it even then. Our politicians are in hiding and it is time they should deliver.The option should be for a new safe road well away from any landslide so that we, the inhabitants of Argyll, can get back to some normal le.Derrick Anstee, InveraraySir,The neglect of the A is a disgrace.It’s not just the long detour via Crianlarich when it rains heavily, it’s the potholes and ruts when we get a spell of cold weather.Three years ago we had a cold winter and the A became a dirt track. Emergency repairs had to be carried out. The Scottish Government said they’d solved the problem. Now we have another cold winter, and again emergency repairs are needed.Other trunk roads in Scotland don’t get closed when it rains or get all these ruts and potholes in a cold winter.We need serious money invested now to solve the A problems. Yet all we get from the Scottish Government is waffle about y public inquiries.We need money and action now to make the A as reliable as Scotland’s other trunk roads, not more cheap solutions.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary electionSir,With reference to theto school, I do hope that the pupils in Lochgilphead Joint Campus are kept in at lunchtime instead of being allowed to roam the streets like herds of wildebeast, with absolutely no social distancing or the wearing of masks.There is a perfectly good ing canteen restaurant in the school and or packed lunches.There is no need, at this time, for them all to be out and crowding supermarkets, fast food shops, cafes and chippies.This needs to be addressed by the Argyll and Bute education department as soon as possible.Name and address suppliedSir,In a leaflet delivered to every home in the Argyll and Bute constituency, Conservative MSP Donald Cameron claims that the #UK Governmentannounced the Argyll and Bute Rural Growth Deal worth £ million# and goes on to say that he is working with local councillors #including Alastair Redman# to #see what further action is needed#.The Rural Growth Deal, however, is a joint project involving £ million from the Scottish Government and a matched sum from the UK Government as well as more than £ million from other sources.In addition the deal has its origins in discussions between the Argyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell, then Scottish Government Finance Secretary John Swinney and the former leader of Argyll and Bute Council, Dick Walsh, in February . The UK Government only became involved some years later.This would be a very serious attempt at disinformation were it not so ludicrously self-defeating. Mr Cameron is standing to be a member of the Scottish Parliament yet he is trying to airbrush out anything Scottish about the largest investment ever in Argyll and Bute and its future.I hope it is merely ignorance of what has happened here that has led him to so severely misrepresent the truth of the issue, becauseit is political spin then he needs to apologise and withdraw the leaflet.Being pictured next to Alastair Redman won#t help him either, given that Mr Redman is best known for his regular letters to local papers attacking the very Scottish Government that is putting an extra £ million into this area.The Scottish Tories need to decide who they are working for # Boris Johnson in London, or the people of Scotland.Until Mr Cameron sorts his loyalties out, then he can#t be regarded as any sort of contender for the privilege of representing the people of Argyll and Bute.Michael Russell MSPSir,The SNP has committed £, to prepare for a second referendum within the next year.Instead of being focused on Scotland’s vaccination programme and protecting people’s jobs, the SNP’s priority is holding another isive referendum as early as this year.Setting aside this vast sum of money to help preparations for a referendum shows the SNP’s commitment toScotland to the politics of ision all over again.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 20 the final tee","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Not before time.I was supportive of the mitigation plan, using nets and catch pits, as the simplest and least expensive approach. It was certainly worth a try, but it is abundantly clear now # with reputedly £ million spent # that it is not working.The , tonnes or more poised to come down on the road may well be an underestimate, and recent closures of the OMR, despite the new bund, doesn’t say very much for the efficacy of the protection. So we need an alternative, and we need it soon, not  years away.Talk of #alternative traffic corridors# is just a distraction.There may well be a case for a bridge-and-tunnel approach. Such has been successful in Norway and # notably # both in Iceland and Faroe Islands, which have much smaller resource bases than Norway. But these would be long-term schemes, each requiring the completion of several major interlinked crossings, for the like of which Scotland’s roads authority has hitherto shown neither interest nor aptitude.The problem at the Rest is a local one which requires a local solution. It’s only a mile or so of road which is at issue there.The alternatives, realistically, boil down to three:Overhead protection might well be required over quite a long distance, as it’s not just the bit at the catch pits which is threatened. The slopes of the Cobbler have experienced slides too. Since the hillside ies it might not be possible to use standard prefabricated modules, and in any case installation work would close the A for some time.A tunnel through to Butterbridge could be driven quite quickly # particularlythe Norwegians did it # but the approach in upper Glen Croe would require protection just like the OMR. Sir William Lithgow’s proposal mentions this, but construction would also almost certainly close the OMR, leaving no ersion for that period.The construction of a new alignment up the south west side of the glen, however, either on or roughly parallel to the existing forestry road, would avoid interference with through traffic.Both the gradient and the transverse slope would be substantially similar to those of the existing A, though thewould be marginally greater, which is probably why the north east side was chosen when the #new# A was built.The core of the case for the third option, however, is that the south west side of the glen has experienced far less erosion, both historically and in recent years, than the north east one.Stand at the upper viewpoint, or better still a little way along the Lochgoilhead road, and look around. The slopes of Ben Luibhean on which the A runs show far more watercourses and gullies than any of the others in the vicinity.This indicates a lot more rainfall impacting that slope, probably by the prevailing weather being funnelled on to it through the pass at the top of Glen More. And that weather is becoming worse.There have been no major slips over the forestry road in recent years, despite a spate of them on the opposite slope. It may just be the trees. I don’t think so, but in any case the trees are there, while it would take some years for tree cover to established above the A.Going back a lot further in time, the pattern is the same. The burn in the floor of upper Glen Croe has been pushed, over the centuries, by slip debris coming down from the north east slope, and the depth of that debris can easily be seen in the gullies recently carved in it behind the new bund.There is also a fair number of impressively-sized boulders on the lower slopes on that side, which at some point rolled down the hillside. Some of these came from the Cobbler, and although most are below the road a few are not. There is nothing to say that more will not arrive.A further point is that while the lower slopes on each side of the upper glen are similar, those on the south west side ease off towards the top, while those on the NE slope do not.It is on these upper slopes that the small slips develop which can pick up more and more water and debris on their way down, hence the fan shape of the typical slip. There is, in other words, a lot less potential for the initiation of slips on the south west side.I think that this all points to the need for a serious look at the forestry road, and I fail to understand why the investigations a few years ago dismissed it as a viable alternative.It’s the existing A which isn’t viable. And why any of these solutions would take  years to complete also beats me. Local objections  There is only one house in upper Glen Croe, and in the rest of Argyll I have yet to meet anyone who doesn’t want a permanent solution.My suspicion is that the biggest dficulty is that Transport Scotland can’t yet find a way to explain how £ million could be spent to such little effect. I might, of course, be wrong in all this, but I wait to be convinced of it.Arthur Blue, ArdrishaigSir,Since the temporary repairs to the Rest are clearly getting nowhere and costing money into the bargain, I would like to suggest a radical solution to the problem, and that is to build a viaduct right down the centre of the valley, based on the design of the MillauFor those not familiar with this structure, it is well worth an internet search. I believe this is still the world#s tallest bridge and is a really beautul structure.Seen from a distance, the white deck and piers look quite unreal # moreBefore anyone asks where that sum of money is to be found, I would point out that Boris Johnson#s proposed tunnel to Northern Ireland may cost between £ billion and £ billion # nobody knows because it hasn#t been designed yet. Nevertheless, Alister Jack is extremely enthusiastic about the proposal, so clearly money is not a problem.Not only would this new viaduct solve the problem once and for all, I suspect that, like the Millau Viaduct, it would become a much-photographed tourist attraction.John McCall, LochgilpheadSir,In last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Councillor Alastair Redman criticises the SNP for setting aside £, of its own money to campaign for an independent Scotland.Not surprisingly, he fails to enlighten us as to the costs of  the Tory party#s #Union Unit# set up by the Prime Minister at the taxpayers# expense.David Hay, MinardSir,Due to the speed with which the NHS is carrying out its vaccination programme, there is hope that we can soon all get out again andto normal.We still, however, face huge challenges. The economy has suffered. The NHS faces a big backlog of cancelled operations. Our young people have a lot of schooling to catch up on. We don’t have much time left to stop our climate changing before it is too late.Here in Argyll the Scottish Government must rise to the challenge of building a permanent solution at the Rest and Be Thankful.These must be our priorities. We can’t afford to spend the next few years arguing over independence.

The vaccination process carried out with great economy and efficiency # and entirely painlessly so that we really will have to stop calling it #the jag#.The real bonus was the warmth and good humour from everyone involved that made the whole process welcoming, so that you left with a smile on your face. Only after the event do you realise what a tremendous team effort it was from everyone involved and all of them deserve our thanks.I hope very much that the Mid Argyll area makes a near  per cent response to the vaccination invitation, because that is what this effort deserves and will demonstrate to those involved the very real, genuine appreciation we have for their work during the pandemic.Norman Rea, Kintallen, TayvallichSir,The rank hypocrisy of the Scottish Tories knows no bounds.While they are frothing at the mouth that the first minister should resign over allegedly misleading the Scottish Parliament, at the same time Prime Minister Johnson was proven to have deliberately misled the Westminster parliament.Standing up in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson stated that all Covid-related contracts were #on the record#.This was three days after the High Court ruled the government had acted unlawfully by failing to publish hundreds of such contracts, which somehow seemed to find their way to those with Tory party connections.Two weeks prior to this, the Health Minister Matt Hancock was found guilty of illegal activity by the High Court, refusing to resign or even apologise when the extent of illegal awarding of PPE contracts was revealed.Last year Tory Home Secretary Priti Patel was found guilty of breaching the ministerial code by being a bully and shouting and swearing at civil servant employees in the Home Office, recently reaching a £, settlement with the former Home Office Permanent Secretary.Compare and contrast that with north of the border, where the Tory party has demanded the resignation of the first minister even before the outcome of the enquiries into the handling of the Alex Salmond case by the Scottish Government has been published.Not a cheep from them demanding an apology, let alone a resignation, for the flagrant abuses by their Westminster colleagues. What hypocrites.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,This Mother’s Day, school feeding charity Mary’s Meals would like to pay tribute to incredible women around the world.From the mums in the UK whose food has nourished us throughout our childhoods, including those who volunteer and fundraise for Mary’s Meals, to the women who cook and serve our daily meals for children in some of the world’s poorest countries, we celebrate them all.Mary’s Meals feeds more than . million hungry children in  countries every school day.That’s why I am asking your readers to send a Mary’s Meals gt card to the special women in their lives this Mother’s Day.

Thanks to the amazing commitment of some truly dedicated people working in the NHS and in social care, lives have been saved and people have been cared for. Stroke teams up and down the country have in many areas managed to continue to offer specialist care and treatment to patients throughout the pandemic. We cannot thank them enough.But the fallout from Covid- is going to pose challenges for everyone in health and social care. Our Recoveries at Risk report last autumn highlighted the real le impact of the pandemic on people recovering from a stroke.Emerging evidence of links between Covid- and stroke means that now, more than ever, a renewed national focus on stroke is needed in Scotland.Health officials have been working during the pandemic to review evidence and define what #a progressive stroke service for Scotland# should look like.This will include improved stroke care bundle figures, improved stroke prevention measures, a national thrombectomy service and stroke-specic, person-centred rehabilitation.The charity is pleased that people affected by stroke will be included in the development of this work.A draft paper will be with the Scottish Government in the next few weeks. Whatever the outcome of May’s election, the Stroke Association in Scotland expects the next government to push this work on, and for a new, improved, progressive stroke service to be implemented.Colin Oliver, public affairs officer, the Stroke Association in Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"argylls abigail releases debut single","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Keith also co-wrote and produced the single at his studio on the Isle of Lewis.Abigail said: #The single is about encouraging women to follow their passions and carve out a le that they can enjoy and be proud of.#The music video that we created doesn’t have me in it, I wanted it to showcase powerful women who are following their dreams in whatever field their passions and talents lie.#The ambition behind the single is for it to be inspiring and help others to find the courage and drive to fight for their goals, no matter what those are.#I have always recorded with my band Heron Valley, who are a traditional folk band, so recording something for myself has been really dferent. Firstly, due to the obvious genre dferences but also because I’ve always had the support of five other people to make key choices, so it’s been a big change making decisions by myself on how I want the music to sound.#I have really enjoyed the process and the musical independence recording the single has given me.#Originally from rural Argyll, Abigail grew up with music very much at the heart of her family learning fiddle from a young age, also being taught guitar and vocal stylings at home with her father. She joined Heron Valley in its infancy while also studying at Royal Conservatoire of Scotland Junior School.As well as touring extensively with Heron Valley, Abigail went on to graduate from The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland where she studied Scots Song and classical violin. Her unique music style and honest song writing make Abigail an exciting prospect for the Scottish music scene and Lady a much-anticipated release.Lady will be available to download and stream from Friday March ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column march 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As many examples as possible will then also be published in the Campbeltown Courier, Argyllshire Advertiser and Oban Times newspapers.The artwork, which must be created specically for this showcase, can be on any surface # as long as it can be photographed and submitted # but it is limited to one image per person. It is not a competition and none of artwork will be judged.Gigha-based youth work facilitator Kenny Wilson, one of the project#s organisers, explained: #As youth workers, we kept hearing the same phrases from young people, phrases like #My bedroom has become my classroom# and #I feel like the walls are closing in on me#. Young people were asking questions like #Where can we go # Nowhere. #Who we can meet # No-one. #What are we allowed to do # During lockdown, very little at all.#The idea is to give artistic young people something to do that#s not prescribed by the Curriculum for Excellence [Scotland#s education framework] or by the government to give them the freedom to choose what they want to do, to design whatever they want to design.#The reward will be seeing their artwork published online and in the newspapers. The purpose of the whole thing is to increase the wellbeing of young people, to give them a boost # it#s as simple as that.#He added: #It could well be that something catches the eye of someone in the wider artistic community and they could be put in touch with the young creator of the piece in question # but that would have to be arranged through the youth workers, subject to careful child protection measures, and with parents# consent.#Kenny explained that safeguarding is an essential part of all that youth workers do and, as such, the organisers have created a GDPR statement which reads: #We will ensure that all personal data that we collect will only be held until all the images have been showcased, and will be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner and only collected for the legitimate purposes of the showcase, and will never be passed on to any other organisation or third party without your explicit permission.#Those who would like to register an interest in taking part, can email ayelovetomake@gmail providing their first name and location. They are not required to submit their surname, full address or age, as long as they are within the  to  age range.When the project officially launches on Friday March , they can then send photographs of their artwork to the same email address so it can be uploaded to the project#s Instagram account, where it will be made visible to the public after the Sunday April  closing date.Kenny added: #If you are a young person with a desire to create, then go for it!#"},{"url":null,"title":"heathers treks renaissance ruins and ancient rock art","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world, walked across Scotland numerous times, climbed many of its peaks and now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves.Lovely Kilmartin Glen is host to many wonderful historic sites and ancient monuments.Overlooking its northern reaches the renaissance remains of Master John Carswell’s Carnasserie Castle stand proud, its ruins eerily dramatic despite now being more home to crow than human.There are many ways in which to explore the area. This circular takes you through time from Carnasserie Castle in the east to the prehistoric rock art at Ormaig in the west, before wending southwards on the path used in bygone days to reach Old Poltalloch. Then, turning east, you come to Lady’s Seat, which offers lovely views down the glen, a brief respite before turning northwards toto the castle’s realm. Glimpses over to Loch Craignish and down Kilmartin Glen give one time to ponder the geology of the area swept by the glaciers of the last ice age.At the car park you will see a small path exiting the NE corner by the information boards. Turn left and head up the track towards the castle. You initially come to a turning left, you will take this shortly. Meanwhile the castle lies just ahead, through a gate and up a steep path to your left. Currently you can but admire its grandeur from the outside, either from here or the next section of the walk .Return to the track and take the turn on your right SW up through the trees and to a gate. Ahead you will cross the field for m, with the castle to your right, before re-joining the farm track. Follow it to a T-junction .Turn right and continue up the field and through a gate. A young forestry plantation lies to your left, pretty and convoluted little hills and glens to your right. Effectively the valley floor is the line of a dyke with the lumps, bumps and ides a mixture of limestone, igneous rock intrusions, sandstones, gritstones, conglomerates and folding doing much to create the complex NE SW flow seen in the shape of the hills and lochs all carved out by glaciers.Follow the track over the col past a gnarly old plantation on a knoll. The route descends for km towards Loch Craignish before veering sharply right to cross the Eas Mor burn at its western end. Note the main track you come on to. For those wishing to miss the path to Old Poltalloch you will need toto this point and keep following it south east to join up with the rest of the route.Cross the bridge over the Eas Mor. Ignore the small path to your right with a barrier and continue for m look out for the new track signposted up to the prehistoric rock art of Ormaig. After ascending m you will see the little paths to your right leading to the stones, a good place to pause and wonder at those who carved them.Return to the track below and south over the Eas Mor. At the sharp left-hand bend turn immediately right towards the sea. After just m, opposite a ruined croft, an easily missed path slips down to a wall. As soon as you are on it, it is obvious and now wends its way southwards towards Old Poltalloch through the ‘Big Wood’.The path is boggy in places with the odd fallen tree. After .km it reaches a forestry road turn left and follow this for m to a sharp left-hand bend. The path goes straight ahead at the bottom of the bend just below a turning point, again it is not obvious until you are on it. Continue to follow this all the way until you reach the road at Old Poltalloch, passing farmstead ruins and the old walled garden on your right. The house itself has now been renovated.Turn left. The track, which also leads to a jetty below, climbs upwards for nearly km before reaching the col leading to Kilmartin Glen. Ignore the two tracks you pass on your left .Descend for m and take the grassy forestry track to your right. After m a path leads upwards on your right to Lady’s Seat, a worthy detour for a grand view over the glen.Return to the track and turn right to descend to the main track below . Cross straight over, through a gate to the right of some sheep pens. Passing a track from your right after mzigzag down through the woods to a gate. The track does a sharp -degree turn right and, a little after, turn left to follow the tracks back to Carnasserie and your earlier outward route.Please note: Historic and Environment Scotland properties and sites remain closed due to Covid the castle can only be viewed from the outside at this time.

Please help us raise awareness and raise funds. Whilst we are all fighting coronavirus, Target Oian Cancer is putting the needs of women with oian cancer before all .In  my mother, the actress Marjie Lawrence, was diagnosed with oian cancer just three weeks before she died. Had we and her doctors been aware of the symptoms, Marjie might be alive today. If diagnosed at the earliest stage, nine in  women will survive. But two thirds of women are diagnosed late, when the cancer is harder to treat.This March, for Oian Cancer Awareness Month, I’m writing to ask your readers to take just two minutes of their time to learn the symptoms and spread the word to their families and friends.The main symptoms of oian cancer are: persistent bloating, feeling full or having dficulty eating, tummy pain, and needing to wee more often or more urgently.If you believe in a future where every woman diagnosed with oian cancer has the best chance of survival, please show your support and visit www.targetoiancancer.org.uk MarchSarah Greene, Target Oian Cancer PatronSir,We welcome the latest announcement from the Scottish Government that communal worship can potentially resume from March  with the possibility of up to  people in attendance, assuming physical distancing of two metres can be in place.Christians are Easter people we live with hope in all circumstances, and the church will be providing guidance to congregations to help them ensure that buildings are re-opened in a safe and responsible manner.While some congregations will adopt a cautious approach regarding the reopening of our buildings # and others won#t have the practical means to do so # everyone will be very glad at this news and will already be looking forward to how most appropriately to celebrate Easter .In whatever we do, we#ll be remembering that the God who raised Jesus from the grave has been faithful to us throughout the whole of this last year.Rt Rev Dr Martin Fair, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of ScotlandSir,The first Citizens’ Assembly of Scotland has submitted its final report to the Scottish Parliament, with its  powerful democratic recommendations aimed at improving the wellbeing of Scotland#s people and governance.I personally would have loved to be a participant in this new democratic exercise, meeting and sharing with, speaking and listening to, a wide range of our people, many very unlike me and with very dferent perspectives, opinions and lived experience.To be informed by a range of expert, evidence-based perspectives, to explore and discuss implications and reservations, and to move towards a rough consensus on a range of key questions that will affect ourselves, our children and grandchildren, and that will shape the future of our country – that’s the exemplar of the active, responsible citizen of st century Scotland.There#s a climate assembly also currently working towards its conclusions, and I await its recommendations with interest and anticipation.Recommendation six of the first assembly is: #That in order to ensure that citizens can make informed decisions in relation to rebuilding their communities the Scottish government and parliament should: establish community-based citizens# assemblies to assess what is happening in our communities , identy gaps and recommend actions, including through digital technology, that can bring people together and make our communities more inclusive.#We have a Scottish election coming up in May, and I hope to see a good turnout as a good majority of Scotland’s electorate, from age  upwards, make sure to vote in this most critical exercise of our moment of power and responsibility.Subsequently, I hope to very soon look forward to a renewed interest in local democracy, as an Argyll and Bute Citizens# Assembly debates and decide the shape of Argyll and Bute#s future for the coming decisive decade.Perhaps that future will include enhanced interest and participation in some version of our current powerless and voiceless community councils.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"longing for a rest","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is mainly due to massive insecticide use and habitat loss caused by intensication of agriculture.Up to  per cent of flowering plants and  per cent of commercial crops require insects for pollination, with honeybees and hoverflies most often doing the job.But with declining numbers of these species, farmers may employ hives of bees to prevent crop yields falling.Wild honeybees forage within three miles of their nest, and onthey perform the #waggle dance# that advertises the location of productive foraging sites to other bees. Also, odours from scented flowers picked up inside the nest while unloading pollen act as cues to guide nest-mates to specic flowers.Now scientists have articially imprinted bees with flower odours in an attempt to improve crop yields*.In trying to establish long-term memory for flower odours, the scientists offered bees in three separate groups of hives alternative odours:  sucrose solution scented with synthetic sunflower odours,  sucrose solution scented with jasmine odours,  sucrose solution alone. They then relocated the hives to a sunflower plantation and compared the foraging activities of bees exposed to the three solutions.First, scientists decoded waggle dances to identy sunflower-specic dances. Using this information, they observed bees from hives fed with sunflower odours performing sunflower dances one hour after hive relocation.Contrastingly, the control bees fed jasmine odours took - hours and control sucrose-fed bees took  hours to perform sunflower dances.This resulted in the sunflower odour-imprinted bees performing signicantly more sunflower-specic waggle dances during the first day of relocation, peaking at  per cent increase over control hives preferentially visiting sunflowers and bringing in more sunflower pollen loads than the control bees.The scientists then measured the all-important crop yields in five plots containing dferent sunflower hybrid plants pollinated by sunflower odour-imprinted compared to control bees.Seed yields in all five plots were highest when pollinated by sunflower odour-fed bees, with increased production up to  per cent above control bees.They conclude that providing bees pre-programmed to forage on specic crops could circumvent wild pollinator shortages and signicantly increase crop yields.*Current Biology , -.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tons of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m stated by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast-track decision making.John Gurr  Sir,I heard that there was work going on in Lochgilphead town centre, and that some people were complaining, about mess and upheaval.

She lit her stove and made coffee as Finn added a few more twigs to their hearth. Coffee made, she was ready to tell the story.Izzy pointed eastwards: ldquoOver there, on a joyful August day, people had gathered for the fair of St Angus when a large force of Buchanan clansmen were seen approaching. They were heavily armed and clearly intent on a fight. But nobody understood why.ldquoThey were from the clan who had bullied the young boy, said Finn.ldquoYes, but remember he hadnrsquot told anyone.

He took one final look over the edge then sat with his aunt, keen to hear what happened next.ldquoA boar is at its most dangerous when cornered, thatrsquos when it will attack ferociously, she said. ldquoWith their backs against this rock, the MacLarens had nowhere to run they had no choice but to fight for their lives.Izzy imitated the sound of swords clashing and waved her right arm asshe had a sword. Finn fought her in the air with his imaginary sword. His aunt stopped the role play with a serious look on her face.ldquoA heart-rending cry was heard, she said. ldquoA brave but young MacLaren warrior had been cut down at his fatherrsquos side.

The Buchanan men began to flee. They were chased and cut down.ldquoYes! said Finn, who stood up and found a stick which he used to fight imaginary opponents.ldquoDid all the bullies get killed  he asked.Izzy stood up and looked south towards the River Balvaig which curled from the loch. Finn joined her.ldquoAye, no mercy was given, none were spared. The last two made a desperate attempt to escape by crossing the river over there. They were chased and both met their end, the last one at a place called Sron Lainie which we passed earlier.Izzy sat back down by the hearth and cradled her mug of coffee.ldquoEver since that battle, this rock has been the rallying point for the MacLaren clan, and Creag an Tuirc their war cry.Finn stood like a victorious warrior, stick in hand, looking out at the scene of the battle. It was so calm and beautul, not a hint of the bloody history hersquod just been told.He asked a question: ldquoWhat about the lad, you know, whorsquod had the fish, what happened to him ldquoHe wasnrsquot a fighter, explained Izzy, ldquoso he wasnrsquot in the battle. People blamed him because he hadnrsquot told of the incident earlier. Who knows what he must have felt inside at all the death people said hersquod caused.Finn raised his voice with passion: ldquoBut he didnrsquot cause it, the stupid bullies did! He didnrsquot tell about what happened because he wanted to hide his humiliation. He was hurt and being bullied. How was he to know this would happen Izzy nodded: ldquoI think yoursquore right Finn ndash the bullies just used it as an excuse. But sometimes people feel guilt even when they arenrsquot really to blame.Finn nodded as he scanned the landscape, then swiped his stick against the trunk of a tree so hard the stick broke in two.ldquoIs it a true story aunty Izzy got up and stood by him: ldquoThere is disagreement about when it happened, but it is a traditional tale long told and seems based on real events, but who can say for sure.Finn looked at his aunt: ldquoI wish I could speak to him and explain it wasnrsquot his fault.ldquoMe too, said Izzy. She laid her hand gently on his arm. ldquoMaybe someone did. Maybe he realised himself.Finn looked at the ground and gave a slight nod. ldquoAt least the bullies lost, he said.ldquoEveryone did, said Izzy, ldquothere were no winners,you think about it. Thatrsquos the stupidity of it all.Finn thought for a moment, then went to the rucksack to take a bottle of water.He drank with big gulps aswashing something down. He threw the empty plastic bottle into the undergrowth.ldquoYou said there was a mystery about Rob Royrsquos grave, can you tell me that too ldquoSure, replied Izzy, ldquoafter yoursquove put that bottle in our bag for rubbish, you know better than that Finn.Finn settled by the hearth and Izzy looked at her nephew, wondering where to start.ldquoThe thing is, she said, ldquoI believe Rob Royrsquos grave probably isnrsquot really the grave of Rob Roy!Finn laughed: ldquoWhat  How can you say that His aunt told how the story in the glen was that Rob had been wounded in a sword fight with a man called John MacLaren, with whom he had had a dispute over land. It was Robrsquos last fight and the wound he received eventually caused his death.She explained that it was said his body was then carried along a coffin trail which went over the hills to the west of the glen at a place called Bealach nan Corp, which means pass of the corpses.The trail led to the shore of Loch Lomond, the earlier home of Rob Roy, then to an island called Inchcailloch where many of his ancestors are buried.ldquoIt was common for dead people to be carried many miles to their ancestral burial ground, Izzy explained, ldquobecause resting with your ancestors was important in clan culture. Thatrsquos why there are so many coffin trails all over the Highlands.ldquoYou mean paths to carry dead people to graveyards ldquoYep.ldquoBut what about the gravestone at his grave here  asked Finn.ldquoThat stone is very old and lay in the kirk long before Rob was even born, it commemorates a warrior lost to memory, most likely a MacLaren. The MacLaren clan was the first to hold sway here.ldquoThe gravestones claimed to be of Rob and his family lie in the foundations of the oldest church, which was associated with the MacLarens even before the MacGregors arrived in this glen. Using old gravestones did happen, but I think Rob will have wanted to rest with his ancestors.Finn was confused: ldquoSoitrsquos not really his grave, why would anyone say it is Izzy pointed towards the south.ldquoAlthough Rob was well known in his letime, after his death he was turned into a famous legend by the historical novels of a man called Walter Scott. Wealthy tourists came here in droves in the th century, on horse and cart, then later by train. They wanted to see the places described in the book just as people do now with films.ldquoLike the phone box from Local Hero, proclaimed Finn.ldquoExactly. It became a romantic pilgrimage and pilgrims need a shrine to visit. So I think someone began the story that those old gravestones marked Rob and his familyrsquos graves, then later the story caught on and had become so popular that in  even Queen Victoria visited the grave, giving the story royal approval. Interestingly, when she visited there were two stones, not three.ldquoWho started this story then  asked Finn, who wasnrsquot sure whether to be disappointed or amused at the audacity of it all.ldquoI suspect we will never know, his aunt replied. ldquoOne way to prove it either way would bethere was an excavation, anda skeleton of a short man with long arms was found, then Irsquod admit I was wrong.ldquoSo you admit you might be wrong then ldquoItrsquos always important to consider you may be wrong Finn, but when something is believed for long enough it can become a truth based on tradition and faith. Some will choose to believe it, while others wonrsquot one personrsquos truth can be anotherrsquos heresy.Finn tried to follow his auntrsquos meaning but hersquod got lost after the skeleton.

But this was dferent, she was talking to him and he wanted to understand.ldquoWhatrsquos heresy  he asked.ldquoItrsquos when you believe something thatrsquos not believed by others, who think they alone have all the truth, she explained.Finn raised his eyebrows: ldquoLike a teacher.Izzy laughed: ldquoLike a bad teacher, yes.ldquoLetrsquos get going, she said, dismantling the hearth and placing the twigs randomly back on the ground.ldquoHave you noticed something missing in all these stories  she asked.

I suppose perseverance is the province of every wildle photographer.Finally, one sunny afternoon, Chris and I decided to go for a drive around the local fields.The road was quite narrow, and we had to pull over to let another car go past.As soon as we stopped, I opened the window and saw them ndash a good dozen hares chasing across the field.Usually, you see only one or a couple at most, so this sighting was exceptional.We parked up in haste and rushed towards the binkying hares. They were moving fast and chaotically, making it dficult to keep them in sight.One minute they were boxing and a second later they were all leaping high up. I could even see hair and saliva flying in the air ndash the field looked like it turned into a real boxing ring!As soon as the group flashed near us, I grabbed for my faithful camera and took several shots.There can be some confusion about whether or not the lsquoboxingrsquo hares are fighting, and whether this is an act between two malesor a male and female .This frantic behaviour usually occurs when a surge of testosterone pushes a buck to chase after his chosen doe across the fields in an attempt to mate.A doe can be chased by multiple bucks throughout the spring, which can understandably become a bit tiresome.This is when a female would turn around and fight a male off by initiating the boxing match. It is not unusual to see fur flying.It is believed that brown hares have lived in the UK since Roman times but are now considered naturalised.Their distinctive long, black-tipped ears and fast running make them easily distinguishable from rabbits.They are also much bigger and do not dig burrows.Hares live above ground in the open and dig lsquoformsrsquo: shallow depressions in the ground or grass.They can easily sink in the forms and blend in with the environment but, when disturbed, they take off and bound across the fields, often in a zigzag pattern.Brown hares can reach a speed of  miles per hour, which makes them Britainrsquos fastest land animal.Unlike many other British mammals, hares do not hibernate or store fat, so they need a constant food supply. They feed on a iety of grasses, herbs, twigs and bark to stay healthy.March and April are the best months to watch brown hares boxing, so I would like to encourage everyone to visit the local fields.Keep your eyes peeled for the hares and stay safe!www.facebook zanslens www.instagram zans_lens www zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"incredibly-disappointing-cancel-haddington-show-say-organisers","story":"The show, one of East Lothianrsquos most popular annual events, had been due to take place on June .However, for the second consecutive year, the committee of the United East Lothian Agricultural Societyhas made the dficult choice to not go ahead with the event.Alan Thomson, UELAS chairman, was disappointed to see the show again shelved due to coronavirus restrictions.However, he stressed that the safety of everyone involved was critical and it was not a decision taken lightly.In a statement, he said: ldquoCurrent Scottish Government guidelines suggest it would be almost impossible to run the event, which would usually attract a sea of competitors, trade stands, and visitors, from many dferent areas of Scotland and the north of England.ldquoThe safety of all our stakeholders is of paramount importance and, as such, we felt it was too great a risk to allow the show to take place this year.ldquoThe committee have already invested much time into the advance planning and organising of the event however, we all decided it would be in the best interests of the society to cancel now, rather than continue and risk costing the society money the longevity of UELAS is of utmost importance to us all.And he added: ldquoBeing forced to cancel our show for the second consecutive year is incredibly disappointing and we know how many people were looking forward to their annual visit to East Fortune.ldquoAlong with many others, we devote a great deal of time and have a huge emotional attachment to the show, so cancelling was certainly not a decision taken lightly.ldquoPlease take care of yourselves and your loved ones.

It stemmed from childhood holidays there, and an artist mother who was \"mad about Italian\", he says. \"When we were kids, we grew up on her cooking from lots of Italian cookbooks.\"The London-born chef gets almost misty-eyed when talking about past meals in Italy - particularly the first time he tasted spaghetti alle vongole .He has a particular obsession with the Italian deli, confessing hes \"an obsessive shopper - I will go to a particular shop to buy one item, and Ill probably buy three dferent jars of passata\", who often comes home laden with anchovies, olive oil and as much cured meat as he can carry.\"I would say I havent got an Italian bone in my body, but I have an Italian soul,\" Randall muses - and he suggests we could all learn a lot about the countrys approach to food.\"Its about keeping things really simple and not overeating,\" he explains. \"Less is more - sometimes a really delicious plate of pasta is all you need, or maybe its a baked dish or a risotto -thats done really, really well, it doesnt have to have  ingredients in it. It could just be courgettes, butter, parmesan and some fresh basil.\"Randall champions the Italian way of \"frugal cooking\" too. \"Its making use of what youve got, rather than going out and buying things that are completely out of season, or making things too elaborate,\" he explains.\"I think were quite wasteful in lots of ways: people go to the supermarket, theyll do their shop and buy lots and lots of stuff. Theyll put it in the fridge, itll be in some sort of cellophane wrap, and about four or five days later, they realise they bought this asparagus and its gone off, so they just throw it away.\"When it comes to Italian food, the biggest mistake we could be making is usually with pasta. \"I think this is where we go wrong: we cook so much pasta that you end up having this huge bowl of pasta and you sit in front of the TV, then you go back for a second portion, and then about  minutes later youre lying on the sofa thinking, Oh my God, my stomach is about to explode because Ive eaten so much carbohydrates,\" Randall says with a moan.This is incredibly easy to do, particularly as most of us can whip up a pan of pasta with our eyes closed - and thats exactly what Randall wants us to avoid. \"We do things automatically, we become like robots and cook things and we have our own ways of doing things,\" he says. \"I think we need to open our eyes and look at Italian produce, and see whats out there and whats available.\"The chef thinks we should all be chasing that feeling of \"having something where youre literally licking the bowl and thinking, God, I wish I cooked more, but  minutes later youre actually fine, because youve digested\", he says.Good quality ingredients can help you get this feeling, which is why Randall has written a cookbook dedicated to the Italian deli. \"I think food has a personality, its very important that there is a story behind some of these things,\" he explains - and talking to experts in a deli can help uncover these stories and give genius tips for the kitchen. Little tweaks to classic meals can make a huge dference: Randall recommends cooking dried pasta two or three minutes less than the packet says, and adding some pasta water to the sauce for extra flavour.Immersing yourself in Italian food beyond a bowl of pesto pasta could help you out of your lockdown cooking rut: as Randall says, its \"very versatile, the kind of food you dont really ever get bored of\".Randall certainly hasnt got bored of Italian food in lockdown, and it doesnt look like he will any time soon. Anyone familiar with the cuisine will know its all about family big bowls of pasta and trays of pizza to be shared with your loved ones. Randalls son and daughter, Max and Lola, have even managed to inherit some of his Italian soul, with the chef exclaiming: \"Maxs love of pasta is almost equal mine!\"The Italian Deli Cookbook by Theo Randall, photography by Lizzie Mayson, is published by Quadrille, priced pound.

Not least because it will be a standing reminder of the controversy surrounding her governmentrsquos handling of harassment complaints against Mr Salmond.Opposition MSPs on a Holyrood committee combined to declare that she had misled them. However, she was cleared by an official inquiry of breaching the Ministerial code and she comfortably won a confidence motion.:BRIAN TAYLOR:This is not a civil war in the SNP. This is more vicious and more visceralEarlier this week, SNP strategists were quietly hopeful that the worst of this issue was behind them. Ms Sturgeon must now hope that the momentum of an election campaign itself will subsume her former friendrsquos appeal.And so begins the first socially distanced election. The cynics among you may say that most people will find little trouble in staying far away from canvassing politicians. But, still, this contest really counts.Consider the cataclysmic changes since this Holyrood Parliament was elected in . Firstly, Brexit. The SNP will build upon that, but cautiously.They will recall that Scotland voted to remain in the EU and will argue that departure strengthens the case for independence. But, perhaps understandably, there will be few specics at this stage as to how and when Scotland would recreate links with Brussels.Secondly, the hideous plague. Self-evidently, the pandemic is the backdrop to the entire contest.Anecdotally, it would appear to be the received view that Nicola Sturgeon has worked tirelessly, although understandably Opposition parties will point to flaws.But what about broader strategy  The SNP will seek to build a post-pandemic economic and social consensus that ldquoScotlandrsquos recovery should be in Scotlandrsquos hands.That is couched to offend as few as possible. It most certainly includes the prospect of independence but does not explicitly rule out other devolved options, at least in the interim.In essence, it is a single transferable message: appealing to the underlying patriotic mood which created the SNP in the first place but also brought devolution into being.Of course, there is an added dimension. Most Nationalist speakers delivering their virtual stump speech will say ldquohellipin Scotlandrsquos hands, and not Boris Johnsonrsquos.They will seek to posit the Prime Minister as an external threat to Scotlandrsquos well-being, as antithetical to the Scottish perspective.Look at the four per cent pay offer to NHS staff in Scotland. SNP Ministers reckon that is genuinely merited and in keeping with the Scottish outlook. But it also helps that it is in contradistinction to the relative parsimony of the UK Government offer.It is also of course designed to quell Labour complaints, as is the move to take Scotrail into public ownership. Stand by for more universalism in the SNP manesto.The Conservative objective will be, as it was in , to corral supporters of the Union into voting Tory. They will depict their rivals as weak and vacillating, specically with regards to the prospect of a further independence referendum.Why then, you might ask, does Boris Johnson not pre-empt the issue by insisting that he will veto a referendum in any circumstances Because, of course, that would undermine the core of the Scottish Conservative campaign. They mean to depict the SNP as zealous fanatics, intent on independence, no matter what.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Alex Salmond launches pro-independence Alba Party ahead of Scottish election\",\"description\": \"Alex Salmond launches pro-independence Alba Party ahead of Scottish election\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media vRZxBmNB poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests vRZxBmNB.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": They plan to argue, further, that the only way to stop indyref is to prevent the SNP from gaining a majority at Holyrood. And they offer themselves as the ones to provide that obstacle, partly by depicting the SNP as ided, citing Alex Salmondrsquos latest initiative.More generally, an edict delivered by the PM would tend to reinforce the SNP message of external interference in Scotlandrsquos affairs. Douglas Ross knows that, especially in Holyrood elections, the voters want politicians to stand up for themselves and to stand up for Scotland.However, the Tories will say the best way to reinforce those Scottish interests is to use what they call the ldquobroad shoulders of the UK to rebuild the economy. Hence announcements such as the transition deal for North Sea oil.Labourrsquos new leader Anas Sarwar has three big challenges ahead. He too wants to thwart an overall SNP majority. But he wants to overhaul the Tories and regain second place.More generally, he wants to reverse a dismal Labour record. The party has slipped back in popular fortune at every Holyrood election since the very first in , when Donald Dewar entered coalition power.Mr Sarwar wants Labour to speak with a dferent tone. Less overtly aggressive and confrontational. More in keeping with the mid-pandemic anxieties of the voters over jobs, health care and education.He is very far from being a Sturgeon cheer-leader, not least because he is standing against her in her own constituency. But he thinks the Tories got it badly wrong when they called a motion of no confidence in her over the Salmond inquiry, before she had delivered her evidence.The Liberal Democrats will try triangulation, appealing to middle Scotland.

According to Professor Curtice, Mr Salmondrsquos sunny predictions of a pro-independence supermajority could turn to ashes on election day. Unless Albarsquos candidates secure a sufficient percentage of votes in the constituency lists their efforts may deprive the SNP of the handful of these they require to gain an overall majority.This of course, will rest on Mr Salmondrsquos personal popularity rather than on the attributes of Albarsquos other candidates. With every fresh vicissitude the former first minister of Scotlandrsquos sense of self-worth seems to swell. In similar circumstance most others would slink away, thankful simply to have survived the onslaught.Read more:Why on earth would Scotland want to be part of the EU anyway Of the other senior politicians only Anas Sarwar, new leader of the Labour Party in Scotland, responded with any measure of dignity. The rest, by degrees, exhibited many of the haughty and juvenile tendencies that have alienated so many rank-and-file voters. Nicola Sturgeon ndash now the primary target of her predecessorrsquos vengeance ndash couldnrsquot resist a pathetic dig at Mr Salmondrsquos perceived gambling habits. The partyrsquos Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, described Kenny MacAskill ndash the highest profile SNP defector to the new party ndash as ldquoan embarrassment.Mr Blackford, a nasty and vindictive politician, is still remembered across the political spectrum for the callous nature of his campaign against the tragic former Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy. Recently, he was forced to apologise for attempting to inflict mob justice on an innocent freelance photographer for breaching travel restrictions . At Westminster, Mr Blackford presided over meetings of his group which were barely-disguised, psychological ambushes to bring down his colleague, Joanna Cherry. One of these figures is indeed an embarrassment and itrsquos not Mr MacAskill.The nature of Mr Blackfordrsquos response encapsulates several of the reasons for Mr Salmondrsquos optimism. He and his senior colleagues have presided over the SNPrsquos transitioning from a party that exuded openness and bonhomie to one now characterised by authoritarianism and mind-control and built around the cult of their leader.Thus, the foot-soldiers of the wider Yes movement, those who turn up in all weathers to march under one banner for independence have lately felt a disdainful chill coming from those who gather around the SNP leadership. These people have felt betrayed and only too aware of how they are routinely portrayed by those using the Hate Crime Bill and gender theory to marginalise them. The suspicion persists among many of them that these ideological proclamations are convenient fig-leafs to cover the SNPrsquos failure to improve the le-chances of Scotlandrsquos poorest communities.Contempt for those who may be tempted to back Alba was apparent too in much of the media commentary. One writer dismissed all those thousands who have already pledged allegiance to the new party as ldquocranks, misfits and zoomers, these being the favoured slurs of middle-class commentators to dismiss anything they consider too rough to be worthy of actual engagement.Read more:Whats the SNPs problem with the working class Another idea thatrsquos taken root among the cafeacute politicos is that by playing more than one pro-independence team in the contest nationalists are ldquoGaming Democracy. Basically, this suggests that cornering the market in list seats as well as first-past-the-post ones is just not cricket, old boy, and undermines the spirit of the contest. Behave yourself.Democracy itself is the gaming of equality. Itrsquos how civilised, educated and opulent people mask the class-driven and unseen levers that still pull in their direction. You might think we exist in a state of one-person one-vote equality but the multi-billion-pound lobbying sector the adoption of neo-liberal power structures and the paths of least resistance always taken by politicians who promised to be radical indicate something .

What unity  The parliamentary SNP has become a haven for preening, elitist performance artists while locking out working class people. It exists as a career opportunity for a cadre of mediocre middle-management types who gather to congratulate and affirm each other in issuing risk-free political emoluments. From time to time they pause, but only to abjure the thick proles for not being sophisticated enough to get on board with the progressiveness.We may all be entitled to take a certain view of Mr Salmondrsquos past conduct and his actual reasons for leading the Alba Party, but spare me the sanctimony and hypocrisy. Nicola Sturgeon, Ian Blackford and their parliamentary drones have fostered more ision in the SNP than anything that might be wrought by Mr Salmond.

You wonrsquot know just how fearful farmers are about this until you see the results of a devastating dog attack on livestock hellip it can be horric.With sunshine forecast across the country from Friday, the masses are gearing up for a great big green escape to the countryside. But therersquos a major change this spring and that has been the explosion of new dogs over the last year which are about to be unleashed for the first time.Glancing down at my familyrsquos rough-coated Jack Russell terrier gnawing loudly on a Nylabone chew at my feet, I realise what a salvation our furry canine friends have been during this dficult time but am equally struck by the enormity of responsibility which comes with owning a dog and the training involved.My hat goes off to new dog owners who have invested in online training classes over the last year, but in the coming weeks, for many, it will be the first time their dogs will be let off the lead in an open space ndash putting their recall training into practice. That open space is likely to be on farmland, and our fields are quickly filling up with new-born lambs as farmers and crofters embark on one of their busiest seasons of the year.  Right to roam is a wonderful thing, but with unfettered access to the countryside, comes the duty of responsible access. So, in short, keep your dog on a lead around livestock and be wary of ground nesting birds and other wildle.This might seem mind-numbingly obvious to most reading this column, but the fact is, there are more than . million households in the UK who have brought a new pet into their families since the start of this pandemic. This includes a lot of new dog owners who may not be aware of the devastating consequences their cute fluffy pet could have on new-born lambs.I will never stop reminding people about the fact that any dog has the capacity to chase, maim and kill livestock, as every day I am confronted with painful stories and devastating images of farmers who have suffered the horric consequences of an out-of-control dog savaging their sheep.This past week, South of Scotland MSP Emma Harper received unanimous support for a Bill which sought to toughen the penalties on offer to the courts when convicting irresponsible dog owners involved in livestock attacks. Now, guilty iniduals could serve up to  months in jail and or a fine of up to pound,. For years, farming organisations and the police have been running educational campaigns warning dog owners of the consequences loose dogs can have on livestock, but now this new Bill will add further weight and deterrence.Since I started my job with the Scottish Farmer in , I have supported Emma Harper with her proposals and have followed her journey as she met up with farmers across the country, listening to their concerns and promising to bring them justice, so I felt a huge rush of emotion on Wednesday night when this Bill was debated for the third and final time in Holyrood and will now proceed for royal assent before passing into law in six monthsrsquo time.This is a huge moment for Scottish farming and offers much hope for the future that these incidents are being recognised and will be dealt with more fairly. The whole industry is indebted to Emma Harper and her team who have campaigned unreservedly on this over the past four years and these tough new penalties will hopefully send a strong reminder to dog owners of what is at stake,their dog chases or kills livestock. Keeping your dog on a lead around livestock isnrsquot the only thing that should be a no-brainer, but so should picking up your dog poo. This isnrsquot just a responsibility reserved for walking on our beaches or our streets, but also in our fields.Neosporosis is one of the hidden diseases which can be carried in dog faeces and poses a serious risk to livestock and other dogs. More dogs are being infected by the parasite neospora as a result of the growing trend for feeding dogs raw meat. The parasite sheds eggs passing out in dogsrsquo poo andleft behind in a field, can remain infectious for up to six months. If consumed by cattle, in contaminated water, grass or in hay this disease can cause abortions and is responsible for more than  per cent of abortions in cattle.I spoke to a local farmer from Ayrshire this weekend who told me that  acres of one of his silage fields was so saturated by dog poo that he was unable to use it to feed his cattle this winter. He had to accept that  bales ndash equating to around pound, ndash had to be discarded. He told me that despite there being a woodland running alongside the field with a route for dog walkers, that the public preferred to walk through his field and were oblivious to what their dogs leave behind. He is rightfully worried, that from this Friday, the hordes are about to descend, and his field will be ruined once again, and his livestock put at risk.We all should exercise our right to enjoy our beautul countryside, but be mindful of whose workplace you are passing through, and afford it the same respect you would ask for in ."},{"url":null,"title":"agenda-local-government-workers-covid-heroes","story":"IT is not surprising that refuse collection and potholes are amongst the first things that people think of when they are asked about the services provided by their local council ndash these are some of the most visible examples of how your council tax is spent.Less obvious are the numerous services provided by legions of local government workers across the country without whom it is certainly the case that more people would have died during the current pandemic.Yet these key workers seem to have been forgotten in the race for votes in the forthcoming parliamentary elections.Whilst NHS workers have rightly received widespread recognition of their efforts, a Covid bonus payment and a pay offer that goes beyond the public sector pay policy, their colleagues in local government have so far received nothing at all.Cosla claims it cannot match the NHS offer for the , local government workers Unison represents.

The police had been heavily criticised on all the news channels for failing to keep order. He wanted revenge. At the Anti- Poverty Rally organised by community activist Joe, black-clad anarchists had suddenly appeared and sparked a mini-riot.Joe Smith had secured a job as a hospital porter in Chloes Hospital in addition to his usual job as a joiner so that he could spend extra time with Chloe. She was  years of age but had leukeumia. He knew and she knew that she was very ill. He had discovered that Chloe was able to analyse everyday political events. He felt he benefited from her views. She was confrontational and feisty ndash just like her mother.ldquoDaddy ndash why cant people protest peacefully  \" asked Chloe as Joe sat beside her on a visitor`s chair one night. ldquoWhy cant you take the clowns with you when you want to say what you think is wrong  People listen to clowns.\" Joe left the hospital ward and thought about what Chloe had said. He and his friends often dressed up as clowns to raise funds for Chloes ward.Joe thought long and hard about what Chloe had said. He had an ideahellip..ldquoMy Daddy is a clown ldquo said Chloe to the ward sister ndash Sarah Burt ndash a few days later. ldquoAnd he is going to help the working class. No-one is better than anyone . And my Daddy is a clown who is going to do something about it.\" Sister Burt sighed inwardly and thought to herself: ldquoWhat is this child talking about  \"On Saturday  November  history was made.  police officers sat in expectation of a ldquo ruck at Ashfield Square. Joe Smith had organised an Anti-Poverty Rally and thousands were expected to attend. A helicopter buzzed overhead, while the police support units were on standby. Chief Inspector Aitken could barely conceal his excitement. That toe rag Joe Smith was going to get his just desserts.Chief Inspector Aitken radioed over to his ldquospotter ldquo in plain clothes around  noon on the Saturday. The rally was due to start at pm. In Ashfield Square there were very few people about but the spotter Sergeant Combes, in plainclothes, had advised him that crowds were gathering at the Ashfield City Football Stadium, half a mile from Ashfield Square. He suspected that they were going to all rally there before marching down to the Square. An hour later he confirmed that there was a crowd of around  but that they appeared to be enjoying a pop and rock concert and a circus. ldquoA circus  \", queried Chief Inspector Aitken. ldquo Yes, Governor,\" replied Combes.The crowd in the Ashfield City Stadium enjoyed the music and the circus. The clowns were a particular favourite. Everyone was having a good time apart from  or so black-clad anarchists.Chief Inspector Aitken was getting more and more bemused as it was now .pm and there was no sign of the crowd moving out of the stadium. Then a minute later his radio crackled into le and Sergeant Combes said, ldquoFour Hells Angels on Harley-Davidsons have arrived in the stadium.\" Five minutes later Combes radioed in to say: ldquo The bikers are on their way to you Governor, but I think I should warn you about something.\" ldquoNot now, Combes,\" barked Aitken, ldquoI am in command mode now.\"The police surrounding Ashfield Square braced themselves ready for action as four Harley-Davidsons thundered into the Square itself. The bikes stopped and from the back of each one, a clown alighted carrying a case. The clowns waved off the bikers who promptly left the Square. The police watched in astonishment as the clowns slowly unpacked their cases and then set up a table and four chairs. Then they all sat down and set out tea cups, a tea pot and cakes. The clowns poured themselves tea and chatted away to each other.ldquoWhat do we do now, sir \" asked CI Aitkens second in command Inspector Brian Donnelly. ldquoWe wait,\" said Aitken confidently. ldquoObviously this is meant to lull us into a  sense of security. Smith and his rabble will be here enough soon enough.\" An hour later, Aitken was about to have a coronary. The huge crowd was still up in the Stadium peacefully enjoying themselves while he was facing a table load of four clowns drinking tea.Eventually he snapped. ldquoDonnelly ndash arrest those four\", he shouted. ldquoOn what charge sir \" queried Donnelly. ldquoClowning around,\" yelled Aitken. ldquoAnd wasting police timehellip.anything you can think ofhellipAs each clown was led away in handcuffs by about six officers each, they showed clearly to the waiting news cameras the slogan on their chests ndash ldquoChloes Clown Army Says No To PovertyldquoChloes Clown Army  \" asked John Butler, Sky duty news editor, as he watched the first pictures coming in of the events at Ashfield. His news crew had been sent up to report on a possibly hostile Anti-Poverty Rally, but it was not expected to be very newsworthy. Now he was intrigued. His reporter on the ground went up to the stadium and reported back to him.John Butler immediately ordered his Six OClock News Team to work on the background to the story. Meanwhile in Ashfield Central Police Station Joe Smith and his fellow three clowns sat in separate cells and slowly smiled to themselves. CI Aitken had been in to tell them that they were all in very hot water and he expected the CPS to throw the book at them. Which was not the view of his  junior officers as they went off duty wondering why they had been told to expect a riot that afternoon.ldquoCan I watch the news on television, Sister  \" asked Chloe at around . that afternoon. ldquoOh wel,lyou must Chloe,\" replied Sister Burt. The TV was switched over to Sky and at pm the main news came on. Sister Burt nearly had a canary when Chloe shrieked ldquo Thats my Daddy !\" Sister Burt turned to see a report coming in from Ashfield Stadium and Square. There were shots of the crowd in the stadium, clowns on motorbikes, clowns having tea in the Square and then finally clowns being arrested.As she listened in she heard interviews outlining the iniquities of poverty. Members of Joe Smiths committee outlined how they had been determined to have a peaceful rally, so had deliberately kept the main crowd entertained in the Stadiumand gone for a thought provoking, very quiet event in the Square. And then one spokesman delivered his main punchline. \"We cannot thank Chloe Smith enough for inspiring us to Send In The Clowns.\" Sister Burts face was a picture. ldquoI told you my Daddy was a clown, said Chloe proudly.Well ndash the story hit the internet and soon went viral. The pictures of riot police arresting four clowns having a tea party resonated around the world.

She probably saw more of him than his we.Mr Salmonds response to the character issue has been: show not tell. Albas -strong candidates list today has a majority of women. It includes two leading feminist SNP defectors: Dumbarton councillor Caroline McAllister, and North Lanarkshire councillor, Lynne Anderson. They were recently elected as the SNPs Womens Convener and Equalities Convener respectively.

Ms Sturgeons forthright promotion of trans self-ID may play well on Twitter, but many older feminists are profoundly opposed. Most voters find the idea of men becoming biologically female mystying at best. The SNP is keen to keep this policy under wraps until after the election.Gender overlaps with an age class ide that has opened up in the nationalist movement. Mr Salmonds appeal is very much to older working-class supporters of independence, rather than the managerialist elite who dominate Ms Sturgeons inner circle. Mr Salmond would have willingly led those massive independence marches in . Ms Sturgeon preferred to march with middle class Remainers in London, rather than the uncouth crowd in Edinburgh with their motorbikes and Wallace kitsch.At an Edinburgh Book Festival event, Ms Sturgeon even suggested changing the name of the SNP because she didnt like being tainted with the N-word. She hates being called a ldquonationalist. Mr Salmond accepts it. It is what it is. He still accepts the recruitment of boxer Alex Arthur, who is a star in Scotlands housing estates, but only known on social media for his offensive remarks about Romanians.The SNP and many commentators have portrayed Mr Salmond as a right-wing, Nigel Farage-style populist leading a rag bag of racists and misfits. And truth be told, there is something of the Brexit Party in Alba. It is a nationalist party that has come from nowhere and is built around the personality of an insurgent, populist leader.The big dference is that Mr Salmond remains avowedly pro-European.Mind you, Alba doesnt seem to have settled policy on Europe. It thinks Ms Sturgeon has failed to recognise that SNP policy is redundant post-Brexit. Since Britain left the EU, the SNP has tried to pretend that nothing has changed, that the borderless  prospectus still applies. Yet everything has, and Alba is right to call out this pretence.There will obviously be a hard border with Englandand when Scotland leaves the UK and joins the European Union. More precisely, there will be a trade and regulatory ide, since the pre-existing UK Common Travel Area will mean passports and visas are unnecessary after independence. Alba sees this as an issue that has to be addressed. Though in opening this Pandoras Box, Mr Salmond could end up with more than he bargained for.A lot of SNP supporters, and Alba fellow travellers, are distinctly unenthusiastic about rejoining the European Union, and not just because of Ursula von der Leyens threats to start a vaccines trade war. There has long been a eurosceptic strand in the SNP. Many on the left favour the Norway option of joining the single market but not the political institutions of Brussels. The SNP has tried to keep a lid on this debate too, but not for much longer.Read more: Scots may loathe him, but Boris doesnrsquot give a damn about Plan BMr Salmond has also called Nicola Sturgeons bluff about a Scottish independence referendum being imminent, delivered by a new Section  order from Westminster. That is simply not going to happen. It is fancul to believe that Boris Johnson is going to risk breaking up the UK just because the SNP wins a majority in Holyrood. He will simply keep saying that now is not the time for indyref, as Britain emerges from Brexit. Sir Keir Starmer will back him to the hilt. Mind you, there is equally no guarantee that Mr Johnson would recognise an SNP-Alba supermajority. He might just echo Ms Sturgeon saying it is ldquocheating.However, this argument that having a pro-independence party standing for list seats alone is somehow undemocratic, or ldquogaming the system as Ms Sturgeon puts it, is simply wrong. The Scottish Green Party is a pro-independence party which is also standing only in list seats. As the Times reported earlier this month, the SNP leadership has been in discussions with Patrick Harvie about a formal Green-SNP coalition and even used the term ldquosupermajority to refer to their combined electoral strength.From the point of view of an ordinary SNP supporter, voting Alba for list seats is a no-lose proposition. Older working-class voters will likely see Alba as preferable to the ldquowoke Greens, whose policy on transgender issues is so controversial that their star MSP, Andy Wightman, had to leave the party because he wasnt permitted to speak about it. At any rate, SNP voters will have to be given better reasons not to vote Alba than that Mr Salmond is a bad man and that standing on the list is cheating. Ms Sturgeon may have forgotten, but only a few years ago the Scottish National Party renamed itself ldquoAlex Salmond for First Minister on list ballot papers.This man is a huge part of SNP folk memory. The attempt to write him out of history, like a nationalist Trotsky, was never going to succeed. Rather than attacking him personally Mr Sturgeon would be better advised to stay silent. Let the electoral system do its work and see what the voters deliver. After all, she is still vastly more popular among Scottish voters than Mr Salmond.

They, and others, now want the SNP to play nice  Grow up.Itrsquos said that attacking Alba undermines the cause of independence. What have todayrsquos Alba supporters been doing for years now  Attacking everyone in sight. If theyrsquod learned to persuade instead of hate after , support for independence would be well beyond %, one imagines.Itrsquos downright gaslighting, which is no surprise really given the party in question and some of its supportersrsquo attitudes to women. These are the same people who claim Sturgeon is entirely to blame for the rise of Alba and should cosy up to Salmond. Get your head around that oneyou can without tripping over the word lsquomisogynyrsquo.But forget the SNP. There are much bigger questions around this Wheesht for Indy gang and their negative effect on the Yes movement.Whatrsquos the purpose of politics  Clearly to win people to your side. How on Earth are any soft, moderate, undecided voters going to be won over by a movement too sleekit to call out whatrsquos wrong within its own ranks Among the conspiratorial, paranoid wing of the Yes movement therersquos a fondness for the slightly menacing phrase ldquowe see you when they think therersquos some ldquotraitor, ldquoplant or ldquoquisling around. Well, be sure, the Scottish people see what this Wheesht for Indy crowd is up to: theyrsquore trying to hide dirt under the carpet. It looks crafty, manipulative, and amoral. Theyrsquore passively accepting the unacceptable because it suits their political ends. There can be nothing more damaging to independence. Be honest and yoursquoll win respect and votes.Unionists, understandably, look on this spectacle with glee. The Yes movement is tearing itself apart, in whatrsquos essentially a culture war between progressive social democrats in the SNP and Greens, and the agglomeration of Albarsquos alt-nat and alt-right voices, riddled with conspiracy theories, disinformation and paranoia. The Holyrood election is now mired in the madness that Alba brought in its wake. The vote in May, which should be about policy, has become a circus. On the issue of independence, sane voices are crowded out by extremists. And yet the Wheesht for Indy mob seem to be okay with this. Theyrsquore either politically immature or on the road to radicalisation themselves. This can only benefit the No supporting parties.If the behaviour of Alba figures isnrsquot strongly called out, itrsquoll send Scotland on a dangerous path. We cannot simply stumble into a place where we normalise the attitudes and behaviour this party represents. It masquerades as left-wing, for instance, while acting as a vehicle for some deeply reactionary characters.The defence of boxer Alex Arthur ndash whorsquos standing for the party and made some appalling comments online ndash is a case in point. Wersquore told hersquos just a working class lad and thatrsquos how working class people act. As someone from the working class, unlike many phonies who claim to speak for ordinary folk, let me be clear: this isnrsquot how working class people typically behave, and saying so is about as left as Enoch Powell.The American right normalised the antics of Trump and the lunatics who jumped on board his iteration of Republicanism. They did so because it was politically expedient. Look where that led and what that did. It ended up eating them alive. Thatrsquos what will happen here unless people have the gumption and decency to simply say what they see in front of them.:The Yes movement has been corrupted by hate and conspiracyIndependence is meaningless unless it builds a better Scotland. The idea of winning independence on the coattails of extremism and hate is shaming. The Wheesht for Indy crowd are no friends of Scotland, and no friends of independence.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Sarah Smith introduced the Alba Party for some reason, wasting important inclusion from the audience and allowed Douglas Ross to bully other participants when speaking.Today listening to Good Morning Scotland on Radio Scotlandthe BBC appeared to indicate it has become the pro-Union voice. Reporters and news segments continually repeated the \"another independence referendum\" rhetoric at every opportunity. If the number of times the debate participants and GMS presenters mentioned independence is counted it would prove the BBC participation in Unionist messaging, restricting debate on other topics. Why have a political debate when the BBC reporters and presenters are doing the job of the unionist parties  Why are they not similarly holding the unionist parties to account  Why are we not hearing of the parties vision for a future prosperous Scotland  That is what voters want to hear.Anti-independence voices are being given an unfair amount of time to make their case there should be a balance. If the BBC is facilitating the debate to be about independence then both sides should be given equal time to make their arguments.Christine Smith, Troon.* HAVING just watched the leaders debate, I have come to recognise how just how important the issue of a referendum on Scottish independence is in the world of Scottish unionist politics.While the programmersquos questions covered a range of issues, it was the prospect of a referendum that was given overwhelming importance, as Douglas Rossrsquos repeated references made clear. Without it he would have had to explain Conservative policies on climate change, the economy, education, condemning abusive attacks on MSPs et al. Thankfully for him, the partyrsquos obsession with a second independence referendum got him out of having to do so.TJ Dowds, Cumbernauld.* THE first Scottish leaders debate was rather a dull affair, presented by the unionist BBC featuring questions mostly about indyref. Only the women stood out, with a spirited performance from Lorna Slater and a controlled and competent one from Nicola Sturgeon. Douglas Ross was a disaster with his endless diatribe against independence, which Anas Sarwar and Willie Rennie tried to counter. As to the question of Union or independence, facts and figures may be discussed, but with conflicting views, littered with deceit and lies, a fair conclusion is dficult.However one question is now clear. If a supposedly highly-subsidised Scotland is such a burden to the UK, why is Westminster so desperate to keep us in the Union  The answer is that apparently poor, wee Scotland holds the majority of the UKs energy resources, including lucrative food and drink exports and has the talent and ability to manage all.Indeed Scotland is certainly \"big enough, rich enough and smart enough\" to prosper as a fully independent country again and make no mistake, Westminster is very well aware of this as they would miss our financial contribution massively.Grant Frazer, Newtonmore.* NICOLA Sturgeons below-par performance at the leaders debate was promulgated by two factors. Fourteen years of the SNP in power leaves little wriggle room to cover up all the mistakes, and independence is definitely not the flavour of the month. Alex Salmonds intervention has been the final straw in what was already going to be a hard policy to sell.The public are genuinely fed up with stre. They are getting enough of it from nature without some politicians adding to it. This election could yet prove to be a bridge too far for those seeking independence.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.AUSTERITY ON BOOSTERS BECKONSTHANK you for your coverage of the Institute for Fiscal Studies report on Scotlands public expenditure , especially in the light of the approaching election.It comes as a timely reminder that every time Nicola Sturgeon opens her mouth to brag of past achievements or to commit to new expenditure, voters should remember that much of it would be impossible without revenues redistributed from better-off parts of the UK. Furthermore, in Mondays leaders debate, Ms Sturgeon pledged the SNP to Scotlands rejoining the EU in the next five years. Not only does this require a referendum on independence within the sort of reckless timescale favoured by Ian Blackford, but it would demand that Scotlands public expenditure is permanently slashed to meet the requirements of the EU Stability and Growth Pact.When these are added together, it is clear that to vote for the SNP is to wave goodbye to the devolution goodies and to say hello to austerity on boosters.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.DONT BLAME IT ALL ON STURGEONI THOUGHT Jim Sillarss roots were somewhere in Ayrshire and not Mars .Is he not aware that there is another independence-supporting party which has been successfully garnering list seats and, while supporting independence, has proven to be no patsy for the SNP  I refer, of course to the Greens.Nicola Sturgeon was right to dismiss the idea of an SNP ldquoreserves party being formed to capture the list vote and ldquogame the system. Does Mr Sillars take the electorate for mugs  They would have seen this for the cynical ploy it would have been and, I suspect, many soft independence voters would have been repulsed by this anti-democratic gerrymandering.I am under no illusions that it is ldquoSaint Nicola who leads the SNP but when will this group of predominantly white, middle-agedmen stop blaming the current situation on her and face up to the fact thatit were not for the inappropriate behaviour of their leader we would not be in this situation and would be striding forward to independence, dignity intact Itrsquos not proud Edwardrsquos army that needs to be sent homeward to think again. Itrsquos Eckrsquos battalion who need to get a flea in their ear.William Thomson, Denny.HONEST APPROACH WILL WIN OUTI AM sad to say that the respect in which I held Jim Sillars has been somewhat tarnished over recent years, however, I was unprepared for his rather seedy suggestion that Nicola Sturgeon should have agreed to the establishing of a \"separate but linked list independence party\" which would have had \"some degree of SNP control\" basically, a pop-up party designed to beat the Holyrood system.Ms Sturgeon has stated that \"weve got to win independence fair and square. We cant game or cheat our way to that\". I think that the First Ministers straight talking and honest approach will be the one which will resonate with the voters in May.Ruth Marr, Stirling.* I DONrsquoT want Jim Sillars to shut up, heaven forfend, Scottish politics has been very much poorer since he faded into the background, but I do wish he would put up. Despite Ian Blackfordrsquos childish remark, a jibe that was more suited to himself, Alba already has a very able, established voice in Kenny MacAskill, butMr Sillars committed himself to the new party it would add greatly to its standing.Meg Henderson, Montrose.WHY ARE THERE NO PROXY VOTES I HAVE two grown-up sons currently working abroad.They recently asked me to contact the Electoral Registration Office in Glasgow, to arrange a proxy vote for them in the forthcoming Scottish election. Both are registered to vote in Scotland.I contacted the office and was informed that UK citizens living in Scotland had no right to a proxy vote in Scottish elections. This right only applies in Westminster elections.Like many others, I recently received the Scottish Governmentrsquos pamphlet, entitled ldquoYour Scottish Parliament election voting guide. On Page  it states: \"British citizens living overseas canrsquot vote in the Scottish Parliament election.Notwithstanding this exclusion, there are a number of other groups who are allowed to vote, including, again on Page , \"a qualied foreign national who has permission to enter or remain in the UK, or who does not need such permission\".It is my submission that those who, like my two sons, are working abroad, have retained their UK domicile. However, for whatever reason, they have been disenfranchised by being denied their right to set up a proxy vote.Historically people have always had to fight hard for the right to vote. It is to be hoped that whichever party forms the government after the May election will rescind such discriminatory legislation as a matter of urgency.Kathryn A Carroll, Glasgow.Read more: Sturgeon only has herself to blame for arrival of Alba"},{"url":null,"title":"alex-salmonds-alba-party-unveils-full-list-candidates","story":"Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, who was the MP forOchil and South Perthshire between  and , will stand in theCentral Scotland region.It came as Alba confirmed it has met its target ofstanding four candidates in every regional list across Scotland.The party will not contest constituencies, but will field candidates in each of the eight regional lists, where MSPs can be elected with just six per cent of the vote.It hopes to build a \"supermajority for independence\" by picking up pro-Yes votes on the list.However, critics have accused it of trying to game the electoral system.Alba said it is fielding women and  men on the list, includingsix current or former parliamentarians and seven serving councillors.High-profile figures to have defected from the SNP include MPsKenny MacAskill andNeale Hanvey.Mr Salmond said: \"This is a thrilling list with a depth of talent, ersity and experience which I am proud to lead into the election.\"Five days ago I asked how many would rally to the Alba standard.

It survives in good condition as a complete example of the technical, support and domestic buildings and structures necessary to provide an early warning reporting .\"The loss of the monument would signicantly diminish our future ability to appreciate and understand the scale of the efforts employed on the home front in the defence of Britain.\"HES said that while it recognised the ldquoprobable benefits of a national space centre, the application failed to demonstrate why the location was necessary.RAF SKAW from Andreacute Ruiter on Vimeo.ldquoThere is therefore no compelling case for the nationally important historic environment considerations to be set aside for the development, it said.ldquoThe application has not demonstrated that any benefits that would arise from the application could not be achieved where, outwith the scheduled area.Mr Strang said the SSC team hoped to enter into constructive dialogue with HES to ldquoallow them the appropriate comfort to allow consent.ldquoBut be in no doubt: we will vigorously contest HESrsquos refusal of permission to develop and enhance a site which, while evidently of national signicance, has for years been left in a dilapidated state, he said.ldquoOur mitigation plans include the provision of resurfacing and repairing the visitor road access, building of an interpretation centre and public conveniences as well as the creation of local jobs.ldquoOur plans show little or no negative impact on the old RAF concrete buildings and by melding the old with the new will create economic prosperity in Unst and Shetland for years to come.An HES spokesman said: ldquoWe were consulted by Shetlands Islands Council on plans for a space port at Lamba Ness, Unst, which we recognise as a signicant project in terms of its ambition for Scotland to be recognised as a major player in the small satellite launch market, as well as its potential value for local economies.

Just today we have heard from Nova Innovation that they are now powering electric cars in Shetland directly from tidal energy, a clear sign of the potential for direct benefits in the immediate future.“These things are all happening and the industry is on the up, but without the final leg up from government – whether in Contracts for Dference or other fiscal support – then someone  will step in.#This is a chance for high-value jobs to be created across the UK and particularly in island communities, rather than importing technology that we could be leading on here.“The need for commercialisation support will only go away when that need is fulfilled, whether it is by the UK or others.

Skaw#s designation as a nationally important monument was also referenced by objectors.Many of those in support, however, highlighted the new jobs and boost for Unst#s economy.HES said that while it recognised the ldquoprobablebenefits of a national space centre, the application failed to demonstrate why the location was necessary.#There is therefore no compelling case for the nationally important historic environment considerations to be set aside for the development,# it said.#The application has not demonstrated that any benefits that would arise from the application could not be achieved where, outwith the scheduled area.#HES, which isthe lead public body protecting Scotlandrsquos historic environment, wields signicant power in the planning process.

It is a depressingly all-too familiar sight.“Stagnation” was the term Mr MacKinnon used, and he was spot on.As lives become ever more disconnected from the land, it’s quite understandable why people no longer have the inclination, or time, particularly when there is no great financial . But how it must frustrate those desperate to work the land to see all these crofts going to waste.Survey after survey has demonstrated a huge interest from people wanting to get a foot on the ladder, but they can’t because the traditional avenue of family inheritance is not open to them.The croft tenancies that do come on the market go for astronomical sums, way beyond the reach of young families and completely out of kilter with agricultural potential.And this is the problem, the reason that so many people hold onto non-working crofts is because they can see the pound signs they can see what it might fetch in terms of its housing potential, with estate agents only too happy to downplay the fact that every croft tenancy sale and every de-crofting application has to be approved by the Crofting Commission. It’s not proved too much of an impediment in the past.In fairness to the commission, they have made improvements. As much as the law enables, they do now try and prevent housing speculation – although one recent case in Lochalsh suggests there may be still some way to go. And they have at least made the right noises about dealing with neglect, which has prompted an increase in formal sub-leases and tenancy transfers.But as Mr MacKinnon noted, it is dficult for them to really stamp their authority without the proper resources.So an impasse remains, young families are unable to get access to land while countless crofts go to waste.But there is a solution, evenit will make for an uncomfortable journey: remove the ability to trade tenancies on the open market and at the same time get rid of the right to buy a croft. At a stroke, those motivated purely for monetarywill disappear their incentive gone. Then arm the commission with the necessary resources to properly tackle neglect —rather than the current practice of gentle encouragement without force — and those who have crofts but can’t do the work will have to quickly find a solution. Step forward new entrants.Granted, the opposition to such an approach will likely be signicant. Denying people the opportunity to do with an asset what they please will be seen as anti-libertarian, a curb on personal freedom, and you can easily predict the outrage.But the responsibility of a crofter is not to do as you please. You are part of a unique system of land tenure which was established nearly  years ago to keep people and communities alive. That is still very much of relevance today. Denying those fortunate enough to have crofts from lining their own pockets and ensuring everyone lives up to their duties doesn’t seem an unreasonable expectation in that context.It is expected that, Covid recovery depending, the new term of the Scottish Parliament willto the matter of crofting reformand there is an opportunity here for a proper radical approach which addresses the needs of crofting today but, crucially, with the principles of old at its heart.It will require politicians and leaders of strength and conviction who are able to make a compelling case in the face of undoubted opposition, who can the see the vision that a new, radical approach will bring and who can reject pressure from all sorts of vested interests. The trouble is: there is precious little evidence of that calibre of inidual in Scotland’s political landscape of today.IT SEEMS like only yesterday I was talking about preparing for the winter and here we are with spring on the horizon.

Photo Stephen Davison Pacemaker PressAndrew MaddenTwitterEmailApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailNew figures have revealed the extent to which Stormont#s staffing levels were impacted by Covid, with around % of all Civil Service workers self-isolating during the pandemic.One MLA said the figures show the Executive#s shambolic handling of its pandemic response.Across Stormont#s nine departments and the Public Prosecution Service , there were , employees at the end of February.Figures obtained by the Belfastshow that there were , cases of staff absences due to self-isolation from February  to March .Stormont#s largest department, the Department for Communities , saw , occurrences where a staff member was absent due to self-isolation out of its , employees. This represents around % of DfC#s workforce.Read MoreNorthern Ireland Civil Service in union talks about remote working for ,-strong workforceThe highest proportion of absences was in the Department for Infrastructureat almost %.

The department employs  civil servants and had only nine off due to self-isolation throughout the pandemic.Ulster Unionist MLA Roy Beggs, a deputy Chair of Stormont#s Public Accounts Committee, said there will have been a iety of reasons for leave. Some may have wanted to shield, some parents may have had to stage at home to mind young children unable to go to school, he said.However, what is very strange is the vastly dferent numbers and proportion of staff seeking leave in each department and further clarication should be made to account for this.People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said the fact that almost % of workers employed by government departments have had to self-isolate through the Covid crisis shows you how much they have been placed at risk from Stormont#s shambolic handling of the pandemic. Although this figure would likely be underestimating the true figures for workers across our society, as it includes health workers who are employed by the department but not the trusts, nor do the figures include those working in retail or the private sector throughout the pandemic, he added.From forcing workers back into workplaces too soon, to adopting a reckless #living with Covid# strategy, the Executive#s approach has put workers and as a result their families directly at risk. The pattern throughout the last year was that when cases were declining but still circulating in our community, ministers decided it was a wise idea to lt restrictions and put people back into work, often in places were social distancing was dficult.Despite talks of learning lessons from Covid and respecting frontline workers the message hasn#t been followed through in the actions of Stormont ministers. Still people struggle to afford to socially isolate when they need to do so on the meagre financial assistance that exists.Separate figures also show how many staff were absent directly due to contracting Covid. From April  to December , of the , civil servants at Stormont, a total of  were diagnosed with coronavirus.The DfC had  workers test positive, while the Department of Justice saw  employees absent due to Covid and DfI recorded . The PPS had the fewest absences directly due to Covid at five, followed closely by the Executive Office with seven.Stormont departments are already dealing with staffing issues, with around , vacancies across the workforce at present.Belfast Related ContentNorthern Ireland PremiumNorthern Ireland Civil Service in union talks about remote working for ,-strong workforceThe Northern Ireland Civil Service is in talks with trade unions about future remote working for up to , workers, the Belfastcan reveal.Most ReadVideo: IRA chanting as hundreds party again in Belfast Holyland sparking fears of Easter disruptionMan in his s dies in M crash Mystery new firm may be on way to Northern Ireland retail park UTV weatherman Frank Mitchell#s final forecast leaves viewers #in tears# as he retires from screen roleVideo: Stunning Co Down home that’s not run of The MillTop VideosPlayIRA chants as Holyland parties continue into the early hoursPlayFootage shows antisocial behaviour in Belfast#s Holyland PlayArlene Foster calls for PSNI chief to quit over handling of Bobby Storey funeralLatest CoronavirusBonfire builders to go ahead with Eleventh night celebrations after PPS Storey funeral decision outrageNorthern Ireland poet and composer combine to make film about lockdown leDUP will roll over for Sinn Fein as always, says TUV chief AllisterWhat we can and can’t do over EasterLatest from Belfast A le in song... new insight into couple#s global fameDaniel McDonnellOpinionThe four key decisions that Stephen Kenny may regret after a tough week for Republic of IrelandPolicing Board u-turn as meeting to be held in public with PSNI#s Simon Byrne to be quizzed on Storey funeralCovid restrictions: What is the latest situation across the UK nations Attention turns to Euro  – who will make Gareth Southgate’s England squad ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Merchant Square is an indication of what Belfast can achieve.”Noel Lander, director at JLL, said: “The landmark sale of Merchant Square demonstrates the investor appetite for best in class regional offices with secure income streams and strong environmental, social and corporate governancecredentials.”Oakland was advised by JLL, AL Goodbody and KPMG. The purchaser was advised by SPS Investment, King  Spalding International LLP, TLT LLP and BDO LLP.Speaking to the Belfastearlier this year, Kevin MacAllister, PwC Northern Ireland regional market lead, said its move into the new offices — expected later this year — coincided with a new era in work. “Undoubtedly the world of working and how we deliver professional services will change, but it’s not either or, office or home working. We’ll be into a much more blended, flexible working regime.“We’ve been developing it quite closely with our people, and quite a signicant part of the floor space will be a wellbeing area. We’ll be providing things like onsite healthcare with GP services, yoga classes — anything that has a wellbeing angle to it.”He added: “We’re trying to bridge the gap between home and office and sort of blur the lines a little bit, so you make an office an extension of home.”The NI Civil Service has said it’s consulting with trade unions on a future remote working policy for its staff of ,.Belfast Most ReadVideo: IRA chanting as hundreds party again in Belfast Holyland sparking fears of Easter disruptionMan in his s dies in M crash Mystery new firm may be on way to Northern Ireland retail park UTV weatherman Frank Mitchell#s final forecast leaves viewers #in tears# as he retires from screen roleVideo: Stunning Co Down home that’s not run of The MillTop VideosPlayIRA chants as Holyland parties continue into the early hoursPlayFootage shows antisocial behaviour in Belfast#s Holyland PlayDrone shows amazing Co Down mill propertyLatest Northern IrelandAppeal for #responsible behaviour# this Easter weekend after popular north coast beach damaged by blazeCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Policing Board u-turn as PSNI#s Simon Byrne to be quizzed on Storey funeral in public sessionCovid restrictions: What is the latest situation across the UK nations Bonfire builders to go ahead with Eleventh night celebrations after PPS Storey funeral decision outrageBudget set to be presented to Executive after eleventh hour agreementLatest from Belfast Appeal for #responsible behaviour# this Easter weekend after popular north coast beach damaged by blaze#We all need a laugh#: GAA hero Nudie Hughes still smiling through cancer battle as he anticipates new season Dublin GAA stars broke rules on Covid gatherings with early morning trainingA le in song... new insight into couple#s global fameVaccine hesitancy in black adults in Britain halves – ONS,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He stands to lose nearly £,he is prevented from bringing them into England. For decades bees have been imported to replenish stocks, strengthen breeding lines and as pollinators for fruit and honey farms. However, thanks to Brexit, only queens can be imported into Britain, not colonies or packs.But confusion remains over importing them here.In a bid to avoid the ban and abide by the law, Mr Murfet has arranged for his usual importation of m bees to arrive in Northern Ireland this month before they travel to England.At the council#s monthly meeting, independent member Dan Kerr said he had been contacted by concerned beekeepers who had asked for help to block the insects# arrival.A few local beekeepers and members of the Low Country Native Irish Honeybee Association have requested council support its campaign to stop the import of m Italian bees into the UK via the north of Ireland, said Mr Kerr.The Italian bees have a notiable disease, which can cause contamination to the native black Irish honeybees.It is a horrendous pest that eats everything in the colony.Our native bee is under threat due to cross-breeding, which will dilute what academic studies have designated the best strain of black bee in Europe. The native bee has adapted over thousands of years to Ireland#s moist temperature and climate and it would be a shame to destroy our native bees# heritage.Mr Kerr proposed the council support the campaign to prevent the importation of the Italian species. Fellow independent Barry Monteith backed him.He said: This plan to import these bees could potentially have a very serious impact on the native Irish bee and I think we should do everything we can to resist all attempts to do so. This mistake can only be made once.The SDLP#s Malachy Quinn also supported the proposal and told the chamber it was important to protect native species.We all know the risk of invasive species to our native ones - just look at the grey squirrels and what has become of our red squirrels, he pointed out. I am very happy to support this proposal. It is not just us, a lot of people in England are unhappy about the import of these bees as well.Belfast Most ReadVideo: IRA chanting as hundreds party again in Belfast Holyland sparking fears of Easter disruptionMan in his s dies in M crash Mystery new firm may be on way to Northern Ireland retail park UTV weatherman Frank Mitchell#s final forecast leaves viewers #in tears# as he retires from screen roleVideo: Stunning Co Down home that’s not run of The MillTop VideosPlayIRA chants as Holyland parties continue into the early hoursPlayFootage shows antisocial behaviour in Belfast#s Holyland PlayArlene Foster calls for PSNI chief to quit over handling of Bobby Storey funeralLatest Northern IrelandPolicing Board u-turn as meeting to be held in public with PSNI#s Simon Byrne to be quizzed on Storey funeralCovid restrictions: What is the latest situation across the UK nations Bonfire builders to go ahead with Eleventh night celebrations after PPS Storey funeral decision outrageBudget set to be presented to Executive after eleventh hour agreementStormont accused of failing ethnic minorities as report reveals increase in racist attitudes in Northern Ireland Latest from Belfast Dublin GAA stars broke rules on Covid gatherings with early morning trainingA le in song... new insight into couple#s global fameDaniel McDonnellOpinionThe four key decisions that Stephen Kenny may regret after a tough week for Republic of IrelandMyanmar remains mired in violence two months after coupPakistan lts ban on TikTok over ‘immoral and indecent content’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

People will no doubt see this announcement as falling short of earlier proposals, promises and plans. In short, it could be deemed a reduction in terms of ambition. I am of the opinion that this strategically important development site would be better utilised for something that adds real value economically to the city and beyond.“However, that being said, I am acutely aware of the challenges facing our health service pre-pandemic.“A system already at breaking point has struggled under the weight of the past year. This state-of-the-art facility will, I hope, take pressure off that system and ensure the effective delivery of integrated health services for the surrounding areas.“The creation of  permanent jobs is also good news, particularly in conjunction with the transfer of Health Sciences to Magee University, which I hope will encourage more students to train and remain.”Sinn Fein MLA Karen Mullan said the creation of the new medical hub would bring better health care for the people of Derry while the Mayor of Derry and Strabane, Brian Tierney, said the project would further open up the riverfront.Mr Tierney said: “This ties in with our £m City Deal which will see a regeneration of the riverfront and which has a large focus on healthcare and innovation in this city and region.”Belfast Most ReadVideo: IRA chanting as hundreds party again in Belfast Holyland sparking fears of Easter disruptionMan in his s dies in M crash Mystery new firm may be on way to Northern Ireland retail park UTV weatherman Frank Mitchell#s final forecast leaves viewers #in tears# as he retires from screen roleVideo: Stunning Co Down home that’s not run of The MillTop VideosPlayIRA chants as Holyland parties continue into the early hoursPlayFootage shows antisocial behaviour in Belfast#s Holyland PlayDrone shows amazing Co Down mill propertyLatest Northern IrelandPolicing Board u-turn as meeting to be held in public with PSNI#s Simon Byrne to be quizzed on Storey funeralCovid restrictions: What is the latest situation across the UK nations Bonfire builders to go ahead with Eleventh night celebrations after PPS Storey funeral decision outrageBudget set to be presented to Executive after eleventh hour agreementStormont accused of failing ethnic minorities as report reveals increase in racist attitudes in Northern Ireland Latest from Belfast Dublin GAA stars broke rules on Covid gatherings with early morning trainingA le in song... new insight into couple#s global fameDaniel McDonnellOpinionThe four key decisions that Stephen Kenny may regret after a tough week for Republic of IrelandManufacturing growth soars to -year high as businesses prepare to reopenEx-Communards star Coles: I am looking forward after loss of partner,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Headed by matriarch Katherine, played by Amanda Burton, the clan was infiltrated by Marcella , who went undercover as Keira Devlin.Series location manager Chris Myers said Larchfield House was ideal for the shoot as it was large enough to suggest the status of our story#s resident family but not so daunting in scale as to be unimaginable as a home.While the family#s dark behaviours might have shocked many viewers, it seems the beauty of the area still appealed.Coming in at fourth place in the top  of drama locations that have helped spark a property boom is ITV police drama The Bay, written by Co Armagh man Daragh Carville.Property prices in the coastal Lancashire town of Morecambe rose by .% - a jump of % on nearby Scale Hall. House prices now average £,.Earlier this year property website Rightmove revealed searches for homes in Morecambe surged by % in just one week, coinciding with the airing of season two of The Bay.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":true The adaptation of Sally Rooney#s Normal People is also being credited for a rise in property prices in Co Sligo.

Dunlop saw an increase of .% in property prices in , more than double that of nearby East Kilbride.Other locations to make the list include Beaconsfield for Afterle, Sutton Hoo for The Dig, and Richmond-upon-Thames for Bridgerton, which saw prices rise by .% to an average of £,.Miles Robinson of Trussle said: The last year has seen a big sht in homeowner priorities.Searches for properties in small towns and villages doubled as city dwellers opted for countryside living.Increased time spent indoors led to one in seven adults considering a move to a home with more space and it seems our favourite TV programmes are inspiring us too, becoming much more than an #escape from reality#.Drama locations influenced property hikes before the pandemic too. Shows such as Poldark and Doc Martin saw more people want to relocate to Cornwall, while the Broadchurch effect resulted in property prices shooting up in West Bay, Dorset.Belfast Most ReadVideo: IRA chanting as hundreds party again in Belfast Holyland sparking fears of Easter disruptionMan in his s dies in M crash Mystery new firm may be on way to Northern Ireland retail park UTV weatherman Frank Mitchell#s final forecast leaves viewers #in tears# as he retires from screen roleVideo: Stunning Co Down home that’s not run of The MillTop VideosPlayIRA chants as Holyland parties continue into the early hoursPlayFootage shows antisocial behaviour in Belfast#s Holyland PlayArlene Foster calls for PSNI chief to quit over handling of Bobby Storey funeralLatest Northern IrelandPolicing Board u-turn as meeting to be held in public with PSNI#s Simon Byrne to be quizzed on Storey funeralCovid restrictions: What is the latest situation across the UK nations Bonfire builders to go ahead with Eleventh night celebrations after PPS Storey funeral decision outrageBudget set to be presented to Executive after eleventh hour agreementStormont accused of failing ethnic minorities as report reveals increase in racist attitudes in Northern Ireland Latest from Belfast Dublin GAA stars broke rules on Covid gatherings with early morning trainingA le in song... new insight into couple#s global fameDaniel McDonnellOpinionThe four key decisions that Stephen Kenny may regret after a tough week for Republic of IrelandMyanmar remains mired in violence two months after coupPakistan lts ban on TikTok over ‘immoral and indecent content’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He added: DS Properties are acquisitive, and they#ve done great things with Crescent Link. They see this park as a key asset to their portfolio.Speaking at the time of the acquisition, Holywood Exchange#s new owner said it was very confident about the economic prospects for Belfast and Northern Ireland as a whole and says the latest purchase very much builds on this confidence in the Northern Ireland economy.The impact of the pandemic has affected all businesses and the retail sector has been no exception to this, spokesman Matthew Beddow said.Belfast Most ReadVideo: IRA chanting as hundreds party again in Belfast Holyland sparking fears of Easter disruptionMan in his s dies in M crash Mystery new firm may be on way to Northern Ireland retail park UTV weatherman Frank Mitchell#s final forecast leaves viewers #in tears# as he retires from screen roleVideo: Stunning Co Down home that’s not run of The MillTop VideosPlayIRA chants as Holyland parties continue into the early hoursPlayFootage shows antisocial behaviour in Belfast#s Holyland PlayDrone shows amazing Co Down mill propertyLatest Northern IrelandAppeal for #responsible behaviour# this Easter weekend after popular north coast beach damaged by blazeCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Policing Board u-turn as PSNI#s Simon Byrne to be quizzed on Storey funeral in public sessionCovid restrictions: What is the latest situation across the UK nations Bonfire builders to go ahead with Eleventh night celebrations after PPS Storey funeral decision outrageBudget set to be presented to Executive after eleventh hour agreementLatest from Belfast Appeal for #responsible behaviour# this Easter weekend after popular north coast beach damaged by blaze#We all need a laugh#: GAA hero Nudie Hughes still smiling through cancer battle as he anticipates new season Dublin GAA stars broke rules on Covid gatherings with early morning trainingA le in song... new insight into couple#s global fameVaccine hesitancy in black adults in Britain halves – ONS,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A remote working and home working policy is currently being developed in consultation with trade unions. The department has also recently announced plans for a number of new Civil Service regional hubs which will enable civil servants to work closer to home, reduce travel time and promote regional economic balance.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseGRAPHIC: RAYMOND ESTEBAN FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueGRAPHIC: RAYMOND ESTEBANFigures compiled by the Belfastearlier this month show that more than £.m in rates and over £.m in maintenance across the nine Stormont departments has been spent on existing unused sites.Read More£.m spent on buildings lying empty in Northern IrelandSDLP South Down MLA Colin McGrath, chair of the Assembly#s executive committee, said: Covid- has highlighted that we maybe should be reviewing our working practices. People who previously thought it would be unthinkable to work from home have now found a pattern and are very much capable of delivering their work.He said there are many, many people taking thousands of car journeys from Downpatrick, a regional hub, to Belfast for work.The fact that some can access a local workspace is very positive for time management and the environment. They#re not using buses or cars, and it#s good financially that they don#t have to pay car parking or petrol, he added.And for Downpatrick, there will be dozens of more people on its high streets, bringing lots of benefits.Mr McGrath acknowledged the movement could result in empty office space in and around Belfast. He said: That#s the challenge - to repurpose those buildings - but we certainly can#t have vacant government buildings in the city centre being held on to for five,  or  years.You may currently have one building with room for , but are out working in regional hubs, you only need to provide room for  or , so obviously a much smaller premises would be required. He said the move away from the city could bring a positive economic balance, adding: I#m a fan of decentralisation in the public sector. It guarantees footfall in regional towns and that brings fairness to rate and taxpayer.They get the benefits of having a workforce near them, especially the hospitality and retail businesses. If you have  or  civil servants there, they will spend a certain amount of money a week in those businesses, while the city centre has a dferent product it can sell to attract those people at weekends.A city office building which no longer hosted workers could be repurposed into apartments, he said. You might have had a sandwich shop selling sandwiches to workers at lunchtime. But now instead of workers, it could cater to people living in flats within a converted office. Nobody should lose out from this.But the DoF and Department for the Economy are not proceeding in the same way as Westminster#s Department for Business, Energy and Industry Strategy. According to reports last week, it is looking at ways to strengthen the existing legal right to request flexible working, whether working from home or dferent hours. The Department for the Economy instead said its focus was on its economic recovery action plan, which includes measures such as a high street stimulus scheme, a flexible skills fund and a lting of age limits on apprenticeships.The department said: During the last  months, employers have already shown themselves to be very flexible in supporting their employees to work from home. Of course, there can never be a one-size-fits-all approach.Every employer will have to adopt a business model that works best for them. However, employment law in Northern Ireland already makes provision for employees to request flexible working.The real challenge for our economy in a post-Covid scenario, is to make sure there are actually jobs for people toto. That is why the minister recently published her Economic Recovery Action Plan. Delivering that is where our focus will be in the months ahead.Belfast Related ContentGalleryBelfast Beat Premium£.m spent on buildings lying empty in Northern IrelandStormont departments have spent more than £.m on empty buildings - some of which have been vacant for decades - in the last five years, it can be revealed.Northern Ireland PremiumProtections against eviction for business tenants struggling during pandemic extendedA moratorium on evictions for business tenants struggling during the pandemic has been extended until June , but there are fears of a mass wave of them being kicked out of their premises when this date passes.Most ReadVideo: IRA chanting as hundreds party again in Belfast Holyland sparking fears of Easter disruptionMan in his s dies in M crash Mystery new firm may be on way to Northern Ireland retail park UTV weatherman Frank Mitchell#s final forecast leaves viewers #in tears# as he retires from screen roleVideo: Stunning Co Down home that’s not run of The MillTop VideosPlayIRA chants as Holyland parties continue into the early hoursPlayFootage shows antisocial behaviour in Belfast#s Holyland PlayArlene Foster calls for PSNI chief to quit over handling of Bobby Storey funeralLatest Northern IrelandPolicing Board u-turn as meeting to be held in public with PSNI#s Simon Byrne to be quizzed on Storey funeralCovid restrictions: What is the latest situation across the UK nations Bonfire builders to go ahead with Eleventh night celebrations after PPS Storey funeral decision outrageBudget set to be presented to Executive after eleventh hour agreementStormont accused of failing ethnic minorities as report reveals increase in racist attitudes in Northern Ireland Latest from Belfast A le in song... new insight into couple#s global fameDaniel McDonnellOpinionThe four key decisions that Stephen Kenny may regret after a tough week for Republic of IrelandMyanmar remains mired in violence two months after coupPakistan lts ban on TikTok over ‘immoral and indecent content’Policing Board u-turn as meeting to be held in public with PSNI#s Simon Byrne to be quizzed on Storey funeral,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The two men helped plan and lead an IRA escape from the Maze Prison in the s. He is highly unlikely to apologise publicly for being at the funeral.The North Belfast MLA represents the older guard of the party. It is his job to keep the republican base on board, leaving the diplomacy in times of crisis to the newer wing of Sinn Fein.The party is in a tricky position, balancing the anger of those who sacriced family funerals because of the Covid restrictions with not being seen to be subservient to the demands of the DUP.Ahead of the Easter break, when republicans commemorate their dead, sackcloth and ashes apologies will not play out well with their base.What does this mean for the DUP, which needs to be seen as tough on Sinn Fein or face further criticism from Jim Allister, who has the party chasing him around for the working-class loyalist vote Mr Allister said earlier this week that all unionist politicians should walk away from the Policing Board in protest at the decision not to prosecute anyone in relation to attendance at the funeral. Not so long ago, this would have been viewed as a radical suggestion, but his calls appear to be gaining traction with DUP Junior Minister Gordon Lyons, who told the BBC the party was considering its position on the oversight body.Walking away from public bodies may make a statement in the short term, but where does that leave unionism#s long-term strategy going forward,those whose resignations it has called for simply choose to ride out the storm The criticism of the Chief Constable, allegations of two-tier policing and questioning the motivation of the PSNI at a time of loyalist unrest is a very dangerous game for the DUP to be playing.With tensions around the sea border and loyalists in some areas withdrawing cooperation with police on community bodies, any ramping up of tensions could be used as cover by those hell-bent on taking opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol onto the streets.The announcement by the PPS on Wednesday that the decision on the Storey funeral was to be reviewed by independent counsel may well buy some time for unionists to revise their strategy.Meanwhile, on what should have been a quiet holiday week, the Executive is facing yet another political crisis, leaving many askingthe devolved government is fit for purpose.Belfast Most ReadVideo: IRA chanting as hundreds party again in Belfast Holyland sparking fears of Easter disruptionMan in his s dies in M crash Mystery new firm may be on way to Northern Ireland retail park UTV weatherman Frank Mitchell#s final forecast leaves viewers #in tears# as he retires from screen roleVideo: Stunning Co Down home that’s not run of The MillTop VideosPlayIRA chants as Holyland parties continue into the early hoursPlayFootage shows antisocial behaviour in Belfast#s Holyland PlayDrone shows amazing Co Down mill propertyLatest Northern IrelandAppeal for #responsible behaviour# this Easter weekend after popular north coast beach damaged by blazeCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Policing Board u-turn as PSNI#s Simon Byrne to be quizzed on Storey funeral in public sessionCovid restrictions: What is the latest situation across the UK nations Bonfire builders to go ahead with Eleventh night celebrations after PPS Storey funeral decision outrageBudget set to be presented to Executive after eleventh hour agreementLatest from Belfast Appeal for #responsible behaviour# this Easter weekend after popular north coast beach damaged by blaze#We all need a laugh#: GAA hero Nudie Hughes still smiling through cancer battle as he anticipates new season Dublin GAA stars broke rules on Covid gatherings with early morning trainingA le in song... new insight into couple#s global fameVaccine hesitancy in black adults in Britain halves – ONS,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

So Ill be in the kitchen prepping on Christmas Eve and then the dinner will be cooked and delivered on Christmas Day for anyone who’s alone or in need of one.Last year we actually had some spare meals left over so I went and delivered them up to the Fire Station, which was the highlight of my Christmas, she said.Paula has been provided with the names of people in the local community who would benefit from the scheme by the Operation Snowball at the OLT and staff at the Long Tower Youth Club.This service is free of charge of course, soyou or someone you know needs help this Christmas please send me a message to the Peggys Kitchen Facebook page,continued Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push Last year we covered the cost of it ourselves, apart from the desserts, but this year Foyle Fruit have kindly offered to donate the potatoes and vegetables and we have also had donations of containers and cups. All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Your th birthday is always supposed to be a special one, a memorable one, where you celebrate in a way you wouldn’t celebrate any others – just to prove to yourself that you’re still quite young, when the truth of the matter is that your best days are probably behind you. This time last year I had taken a week’s holidays in honour of my big day, and I had plans, big plans – but they were wiped out by something none of us has never experienced before, and I’m not talking about a warm day in Derry or a job offer with WWE. googletag.cmd.push Covid- had arrived a few days earlier and we were all living with the fear of the unknown. We weren’t allowed to visit our friends or family, we were only allowed a certain distance from our own houses and we were advised to start wearing masks. It was scary stuff at the time. So instead of going for a day away, planning a two-hour massage, or even going to the cinema , I was sat on the sofa playing FIFA . I was in the middle of winning the Champions League, and breaking Barcelona hearts yet again, when my phone rang. The long and short of that call was this – I was put on furlough for ‘six weeks’. googletag.cmd.push This was devastating to me as, mingled with the fear of the virus, everything was collapsing around me – It was easy to catastrophise in that moment, and I did suffer for a few hours, thinking my job was gone – what a th birthday present. As a sports reporter, I knew I was up against it. How could I do my job when there was no sport to cover  Yet for it to all happen so quickly took me by surprise and I was shocked and hurt by the sudden change in my circumstances, professionally and personally. Something I have learned over recent years however is that it’s all about mindset. We only give power to our thoughts depending on how we react in any given situation. It is natural to be upset, and afraid, butwe can bounce back quickly, we are all the better for it.     If we can stop those irrational thoughts in their tracks and look at situations more realistically, we have a better chance of coping with bad news. It is dficult, but a healthy habit to get into. Talking to a friend, a partner, a family member – anyone really, about how you feel can help massively, evenyour instinct is to hide away and let those thoughts carry you away. Talking is what I did, and with supportive words from a few good friends, I faced the situation head on. Those six weeks, which ultimately turned into three months, were some of the best weeks I have had in years. It is easy to forget how to live these days. If we’re not rushing to leave the wains at school, we’re rushing to work, worrying about bills and running errands of all sorts – we tick all the boxes of how we’re all supposed to spend our daily lives.Having three months off with no deadlines, no pressure, no work-related stress was alien to me, so I did something I hadn’t done regularly in years. I walked. Remember the weather in the first lockdown  It was perfect. So I took a book off my neglected bookshelf, and I walked the back roads around Sherf’s Mountain. Every time I told someone I was out walking reading they thought I was mad and that I was a cert to be plowed down by a passing carI wasn’t careful. That didn’t stop me – I took my sweet time about it, and I read as I walked and I walked as I read. I spent hours on those roads, getting fresh air that I hadn’t experienced in years, and catching up to something I have loved all my le in reading. I would find a nice spot and sit in the sun and read and then I would walk some more.  The Covid circumstances aside, it was perfection. And I’ll tell you another thing. When Covid hit I was in agony with my leg and hip, so much so that it was a real struggle to get up off the sofa or walk up a set of stairs. It had only been getting worse. Within a few weeks of walking every day – and I’m not talking ridiculous miles here – the pain had gone completely and I was like a new man. I may have looked like a hobo with a multi-coloured beard, but I was feeling better, physically and mentally, than I had in literally years. I remember saying it then and I’ll repeat it now – it felt like my le was on hold, and I was all the better for it. I know people will empathise with that. I had been putting too much focus in the wrong areas and I was suffering because of it. My priorities were all wrong. We’ve all heard of self-care, but do we understand what it means  For me it was walking, reading and fresh air, something that I could have realistically done every day. I had just forgotten how to do it, or more accurately, that I needed to do it. I felt like Morgan Freeman at the end of the Shawshank Redemption – walking those Maine roads as he fulfilled his promise to his friend Andy – I felt the freedom that only a free man could feel. And I was free – for the time being. If I wasn’t walking with my book, I was walking with my wains, and it I wasn’t doing either of those things, I was walking with friends, social distancing of course. I knew I would get the call toto work, and I knew I would be devastated when I did. That came in June and I was back at it – but I was back at it with a new attitude- evenit took me a while to get fully back at it – I can still have pride in my work and do a good job without making it the be all and end all. If Covid has taught us anything, it is the importance of ourselves, of our family, and of friends we’ve lost and friends we still have. Those are really the only things that matter.  I started this piece aiming to reflect on the dficulties of a sports reporter working in a world with no sport. That has been hard – but it has also been rewarding. So many local teams have gone above and beyond to help out in the community, and their creativity in keeping themselves fit and active over the past year has been inspiring. That team spirit has never wavered despite the lack of competition, and there have been so many examples of the importance and the power of sport in our lives. Sport itself is self-care. Training is self-care. Being with team mates is self-care. Covid has tried to take that and so much more away from us, but, as we see a small light at the end of a long tunnel, we know that it has only strengthened us. For me, that strength came simply from rediscovering something which I had lost. For you it could be music, running, painting or swimming. Whatever it is, when this finally comes to an end, please make room for it. Please remember what it is about le that you actually enjoy. It’s not a race to get the bills paid or the wains to bed so you can relax for a few hours. It’s about making time for yourself, doing what’s right for your mind and your body and enjoying ourselves while we’re still young. I’m back at work a while now, but I am still making time for walking – it really clears the head and blows the cobwebs of a day aside. I’m now , but as long as I can walk those roads and read my book , I’ll be doing myself a massive favour. Take care of yourself, every day. No one  is going to do it for you.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Redcastle hotel is located in the once proud and independent peninsula of Inishowen. The last of the Irish chieftains with whom this site is associated was Cahir ODoherty. Cahir became chieftain at the age of  in , after the death of his father, Sir John O Doherty. In order to secure his position, Cahir changed his family’s side in the Nine Year War year and swore loyalty to Queen Elizabeth, because of Inishowens important strategic location and the defeat of the Confederates at Kinsale in . googletag.cmd.push The war ended in . It resulted in the Flight of the Earls from Rathmullan in  and the Plantation of Ulster. Cahir thought his reward for his help and loyalty would be great. But apart from being knighted and acquiring the title Sir, he was to be disappointed. In frustration the -year-old chieftain rebelled in , sacking the English held city of Derry and burning it to the ground. He was killed shortly after this in the Battle of Kilmacrennan, just outside Letterkenny. Because of this rebellion King James I ordered the great walls of Derry to be built. After Cahir, the last Inishowen Chieftain, was killed, all his lands in Inishowen were seized by the James I for plantation and ided between The Established church and Arthur Chichester. The two separate entities that were then Inishowen and Tyrconnell were joined and made into one county. It was named Donegal. googletag.cmd.push The first house built on the site of the Redcastle hotel was built by the Carey family. The Cary family were landlords who received plantation lands from Moville to Muff. The family lived here from about  to , almost exactly  years. Unfortunately for the Careys, they had money problems and eventually were forced to sell the Redcastle house and Estate in . Thomas Doherty from Muff purchased the house from the Careys, but because of legal issues it took  years for them to complete the sale. The most famous of the Careys was Joyce Carey. Joyce Cary was listed in the top  writers in English by The Sunday Times. Some of his books were made into film. His son and grandson continued in the creative theme and were involved in TV series such as Dr Who and Captain Pugwash.     Thomas Doherty left the estate to his youngest daughter, Jane, who was married to Dr Richard Doherty, a lecturer in midwery in Queens University, Galway. Dr Richard Doherty died in  and his we Jane in . Richard converted to Catholicism late in his le and left the Redcastle estate to his daughter, Elizabeth and her husband Captain Ernest Cochrane, on the condition that the children be brought up as Catholics. The year before Elizabeth died she was in dispute with the local land league on the reduction of rents. Armed men were employed to secure her crops after locals refused to harvest them. They were unsuccessful at getting the crops harvested, but it is said they did get through quite an amount of Jameson whiskey and food. Captain Ernest Cochrane was the son of the famous and notorious Lord Thomas Cochrane, on which the films Master and Commander and Hornblower are based. Earnests famous bloodline does not end there as he is also a descendent of Robert the Bruce who actually invaded and occupied Northburg Castle in Greencastle for a short period. True love must have been very much in the air as the condition that Richard Doherty left for marriage and inheritance at this time would have been quite a diplomatic feat, given that Earnest was also the high sherf of Donegal. But they managed it. Captain Cochrane went to church in his Model T car. Reg number Hand Elizabeth and her children in their horse and carriage to Drung Chapel. To this day they are still separated, Earnest in a grand monument grave in front of the now derelict Church of Ireland Church in Redcastle. Elizabeth Francis with her children and her parents are interred at the alter area of the old Catholic Church, Drung. After the ious land acts that were introduced after , landlordism went into terminal decline. Lands were sold off and the large houses were either left to rot away or knocked down to avoid taxes on them. Redcastle House survived. Captain Earnest Cochrane died in  and Elizabeth Francis in . The Cochranes remained and turned their hand to farming and in the s opened the Redcastle House as an Hotel. The Cochranes sold Redcastle in  and the hotel is now once again back in the ownership of a Doherty.

There is not a girl woman anywhere who doesnt like a piece of jewellery or an aromatic fragrance. You could include a few men in that, too! Among them are two young Derry girls who love all things glittery and sparkly – and a nice fragrance – so much so, they have used their time during Covid- lockdown to start up their own fragrance business. Sisters Mia, , and Bella Doherty, , from Cornshell Fields in the Ballyarnett of the city, named their enterprise Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella- a combination of their names – and after almost a year of research, trials and checking out regulations, they have their enterprise up and running. googletag.cmd.push At the minute, they are making wax melts of ious fragrances and shapes along with room sprays to match the wax melts smells. They are also currently looking into other products as well. Mia, who attends St Marys College, said they began researching soon after the Covid- restrictions were introduced in March last year. She added: “We undertook online courses in candle-making tohelp our wee idea become a reality. “We tried out dferenttypes of soya wax andfragrances with our family being thetesters, much to their delight for a goodfew months. “We wanted to be % happywith our product before we decidedthey were ready for purchase.So the launch of Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella began last month. googletag.cmd.push “We are both currentlyusing our mum’s kitchen but she doesn’tmind as we clean up after ourselves and her house always smells solovely for her. “Also, by law, we have to follow certain regulations, so have to ensure CIP labels are made for every fragranceoil and then bepresently packaged. This can all take a lot of timebut we really love being creative and by adding glitter and colour and trying out dferent designs makes our wax melts stand out compared to others.Having nice packaging and how they are presented is very important to us “We make wax melts by melting soya wax and adding fragrancesoils and pour into moulds, although this sounds very straight forwardthere is temperature taking anda few step-by-step instructions that need to be adhered toin order to maintain a good quality product that will last.”     Despite the success and the enjoyment of making fragrances, Mia said she was looking forward to going back to school. “St Mary’sis a fantastic school and I love getting up to go to school every morning.” She admitted she was a bit concerned about how much catching up she will have to do but said she was sure the teachers would put everyone at ease when they were all back in the classroom. “We definitely missed schoola lot,especiallynot seeing our friends was dficult but starting this business has helpedkeep us occupied and easeanyboredom. “Learning our craft and keeping upwithschoolwork has made the wholeCovidsituation fly in for us. Weare so busy at the minutewith orders for delivery that our mum had to help out as well. She is able to help at the minute as her business is currently closed due toCovid- restric- tions.She was a great help at the start as she was able to guide us in the right direction - we have even roped dad into helping by doing the deliveries.” She added: “I hope we go back to normality as I like the hands on physical activities at school like technology and science experiments.” Bella, who ed to P at Steelstown Primary School on Monday last, said despite the enjoying of producing Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella products, school work was her priority. “I was a bit nervous about ingto school but it was great. I have a new teacher and she is really lovely. It was great seeing all my friends as well. This is my last year in primary school so I am really happy to be getting backto see everyone before I have to make the transition to secondary school.” Bella said they had been inundated with very positive reviews for their range of products. “Everyone seems to love the product going by the lovely messages we receive.Customers wish us every success andfor more orders so this makes us very happy. “When we are back at school full-time and not able to commitour time as much to the business as school is the priority, my aunties are willing to help out to keep us well stocked up with our products. “The people in our cityand beyondhave been really supportive inshopping local, it feels good to know we’re doing something right.” The girls mother, Maria, is understandably so proud of her two girls, being the owner of Miabella beauty salon next to the car wash on Racecourse Road in Shantallow which has been closed for nine months of the past year. She said: “If there’s one thing I can take from lockdownis that I work too much and the girls missed me, so spending quality time and helping them out with their wax melts was amazing. I’ve learned so much from them and how much of a work ethicis instilled into them, “I am so proud of them both andhow they have juggled both school work and their newly established business. “They both are managing perfectly so farand I can go back to work and know they are perfectly capable of staying on top of orders. “As their mum, though, I will keep on top of the social mediato ensure their safety - their page is linked to my phone so I can keep them safe.” Maria conceded she has found lockdown extremely dficultat times. She added: “I really miss my clients, as a lot of them have become friends over the years. It’s always good to catch up with each other.I’m so looking forward to seeing each and every single one of them when I canalthough trying to fit everyone in will prove to be a dficult task. “Somehow, I’ll man- ageshould I work night and day to get you all beautied again.I don’t like to disappoint anyone when they look for appointments, my clients are lovely and are very understanding.” So Chanel, Jimmy Choo and Gucci, take note of the name - Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Magherafelt has been included in the regions top three, alongside Strangford Loch and outright winner, Holywood, both in County Down. Expert judges behind the Sunday Times guide assessed a number of factors in making their decision, from schools, air quality, transport and broadband speed to culture, green spaces and the high street. They looked for improving towns, villages or city centres, for attractive, well-designed homes and locations bursting with community spirit. Magherafelt was selected as a supremely practical choice for families thanks to its convenient central location, rapidly improving town centre and excellent schools. googletag.cmd.push Local grammar school Rainey Endowed, which recently won the Sunday Times School of the Decade award, was singled out for praise. Judges were also impressed by the sports facilities at Meadowbank Multi-Sports Arena and Moyola Park Golf Club, as well as the towns choice of hairdressers, beauty salons and coffee shops. Sunday Times Property Editor, Helen Davies, said this had been a good year for small towns. “This guide has never been so important. The pandemic has taught us just how much we rely on our homes, our communities and our surroundings,” she said. “With working from home now common, it’s no surprise that many of us are reassessing our priorities and thinking hard about where we really want to live. googletag.cmd.push “Our focus for this year has been community, countryside and convenience. It hasn’t been a year for big cities or small villages. “Instead it is small towns that have shone: big enough to have everything you need within walking distance and small enough for everyone to feel connected.” Local councillor Darren Totten said the announcement was no surprise to him as a Magherafelt man. The focus of the experts is on amenities, location, educational and sporting facilities - which this study rightly shows to be amongst the very best available, he said. For me, though, the very best of Magherafelt is that we have a great community in the town and main ingredient in any community is the people.     The people of Magherafelt have proven many times in recent years that when anyone is in need, its all hands to the pump regardless of who it is needs help.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Fort George site is owned by the Department for Communitieswho is leading on its regeneration. There has been many years of debate over what the prominent riverside should be used for.

My Department is committed to maximising Fort George’s potential and is delighted to work with the Trust to accommodate this ambitious development which will deliver key health services to the community in Derry.” The department says that the development of a Cityside Health and Care Centre is anticipated to create  new permanent jobs as well as centralising approximately  posts in a modern state of the art facility. googletag.cmd.push The positions will include nursing, social work, allied health professional and administrative roles as well as the relocation of a number of GP surgeries. Health Minister Robin Swann welcomed the proposed new centre. “This is an important step towards ensuring the delivery of high quality integrated primary and community care services within the city-side of Londonderry, and also towards improving the health service infrastructure within Northern Ireland. I recognise the efforts of all concerned in securing the site for this new facility and my Department will continue to support this project as it moves to the next stage.” Alan Moore, Director of Strategic Capital Development with the Western Health and Social Care Trust,said: “The Western Trust welcomes the decision by the Department for Communities Minister to agree to the sale of part of the Fort George site to the Western Trust.     I want to thank the Minister and her local officials with whom the Trust has worked closely over the past number of months. The announcement today will assist in facilitating plans for the Cityside Health and Care Centre at Fort George, bringing together GP and associated healthcare services in an integrated model.” Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey continued: “My Department has already started a piece of work to revise the existing Fort George masterplan. This revised masterplan will determine the location of the Health and Care Centre on the site and will also provide further clarity in relation to further potential development opportunities for the wider site in the future.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey announced earlier today that she has agreed that the Fort George site can be the location of a new health centre. The site is owned by the Department for Communitieswho is leading on its regeneration. There has been many years of debate over what the prominent riverside should be used for. However, to date, only a large office block has been built on the land. After an Expression of Interest exercise, DfC entered an agreement with the Western Health and Social Care Trustso that they could further develop their proposal for the health and care centre to be located on the site. googletag.cmd.push Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey said: “Fort George is a strategic regeneration site that has huge potential to create real social and economic benefits for the City of Derry and beyond. “I am delighted to announce that I have agreed to provide part of the site to the Western Health and Social Care Trust for their Health and Care Centre. My Department is committed to maximising Fort George’s potential and is delighted to work with the Trust to accommodate this ambitious development which will deliver key health services to the community in Derry.” The department says that the development of a Cityside Health and Care Centre is anticipated to create  new permanent jobs as well as centralising approximately  posts in a modern state of the art facility. googletag.cmd.push The positions will include nursing, social work, allied health professional and administrative roles as well as the relocation of a number of GP surgeries. However, SDLP Foyle MLA Mark H Durkan has expressed reservations about the proposal for the Fort George site. “While it would be foolish not to see the merit in a new health hub, particularly in the current climate, Fort George is perhaps not the most suitable location, said Mr Durkan. “People will no doubt see this announcement as falling short of earlier proposals, promises and plans. In short, it could be deemed a reduction in terms of ambition.     I am of the opinion that this strategically important development site would be better utilised for something that adds real value economically to the city and beyond. “However, that being said, I am acutely aware of the challenges facing our health service pre-pandemic. A system already at breaking point has struggled under the weight of the past year- this state-of-the-art facility will I hope, take pressure off that system and ensure the effective delivery of integrated health services for the surrounding areas. The creation of  permanent jobs is also good news, particularly in conjunction with the transfer of Health Sciences to Magee University, which I hope will encourage more students to train and remain.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The shutting of the outlet at Lisnagelvin Shopping Centre is one of  stores earmarked for closure across Scotland, Northern Ireland and the North East of England. The companys other store in the city at Foyleside Shopping Centre on the cityside is to remain open. The closures have been prompted by ongoing challenges to high street trading, which have been exacerbated by the Covid- pandemic. Semichem, which is owned by community retailer Scotmid Co-operative, said it was in talks with landlords in several locations and would make a final decision on a small number of the  stores in the coming months. googletag.cmd.push A total of  Semichem staff have now entered a formal consultation process. Management at Scotmid Co-operative, owners of Semichem, said they were exploring opportunities to redeploy as many as possible within its wider business. Karen Scott, head of Semichem, said: “The high street was already struggling to adapt to the pace of change in shopping habits, including out-of-town developments and the rise of internet shopping. That change has undoubtedly been accelerated by the Covid- pandemic. Sadly, we have reached the point where it is no longer viable to keep some of our stores open. “We are grateful for both Scotmid and subsequent government sup- port, which has undoubtedly prolonged the le of many stores.

Many of the pieces have been dedicated to inidual key workers in the city as a thank-you for all their tireless efforts throughout the pandemic. Recent visitors to Foyleside Shopping Centre will definitely feel that Spring is in the air with the installation of the colourful handiwork which is aptly entitled ‘New Beginnings’. Beautul bunnies and charming chicks are just some of the cute characters featured in the vibrant craft masterpieces together with an assortment of intricately stitched throws guaranteed to bring smiles to the faces of visitors of all ages. googletag.cmd.push  The seasonal installation will reach an audience of millions after award-winning local production company, AlleycatsTV, produced a short film in celebration of the women whose devotion to crochet has helped them overcome the challenges of lockdown. The queen of crochet is Margaret Crabtree who has been teaching the craft for almost three decades after volunteering for a fundraiser at her daughter’s nursery school in the s. Coming from a family of crafters, Margaret now loves to share her expertise and see other women thrive with their new-found skills. Through her business, ‘Keep Her Knit’, she teaches more than a dozen classes in Derry city as well as in Counties Derry, Tyrone and Donegal. googletag.cmd.push Classes have moved online during lockdown, providing a leline for her students, many of whom are older and or living alone. Margaret said: “We wanted to do something to show that we’re together, even though we’re apart. The crochet groups I take are like a family. I’ve been taking classes by Zoom during the pandemic, but we all really miss the social aspect of meeting up. “Working on the ‘New Beginnings’ pieces gave us something to focus on and it’s fantastic to see them all up in Foyleside, they are a mix of ability levels and some of them are real masterpieces but it’s so good for everyone’s self-esteem, regardless of the level.     “All the ladies in my groups keep saying to one another, ‘what would we have done all daywe hadn’t been crocheting ’ so it’s good to know that it’s helped them get through the boredom and isolation of the lockdowns. They are a real community, stitching the city together the skill level is phenomenal and a tribute to our heritage of sewing which is in the genes and it’s just great to be able to showcase it. I’m always striving to bring these talents to a wider audience.” The project was funded by Bluebell Arts Derry through the Department for Communities. Two of Margarets students, Mary Walsh and Theresa McSwiney, are both interviewed for tonight’s programme. Niamh Minihan from AlleycatsTV said: “I have been aware of the fantastic talent amongst the Keep Her Knit members for a long time. Some of my own family love to crochet and have been taught by Margaret Crabtree. It has been a real pleasure for me to direct this film and shine a light on such a positive story for our city. Alleycats are a Derry-based company and we are passionate about telling stories from our hometown.” Fergal Rafferty, Manager of Foyleside Shopping Centre, is delighted to see its spacious mall transformed for Spring. He said: “Foyleside always loves to support and showcase the skills of local people and the communities we serve. The New Beginnings display is really eye-catching, the level of talent in our city is remarkable and the colours and theme will be so uplting for all of our valued customers and staff coming into the Centre over Easter. We have no doubt that viewers of ‘The One Show’ will love it just as much as we do too.” Tune in to ‘The One Show’ on BBC One this evening, March , at pm, to see Margaret, Theresa and Mary from the Gasyard classes and Foyleside in all its Easter glory!  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The partys Foyle MLA Gary Middleton was speaking this week at the launch of a new report into the views of Protestants living in the Derry City and Strabane District Council area. The study, which was carried out on behalf of the Londonderry Bands Forum, interviewed more than  people in the council area to find out their views on a wide range of issues. A similar study was carried out in  in conjunction with Queens University and the University of Ulster. googletag.cmd.push When compared to the  findings, the new study shows a % increase in the number of Protestants under the age of  who feel welcome throughout the city town in which they live. The study also shows that members of the local Protestant community now feel more comfortable visiting Derrys city centre. In , % of respondents said that they would not go to Guildhall Square. In the new study, this figure has fallen to %. The percentage of people who say they feel comfortable visiting Foyle Street has witnessed a similar decline from % to %. The new study highlights that the Peace Bridge and the bringing of Protestant cultural events to the cityside has had an evident impact on cross-city mobility. googletag.cmd.push The new report was launched on Monday. Speaking during a discussion to mark the launch, Mr Middleton welcomed the new report and said initiatives such as the construction of the Peace Bridge and the  City of Culture celebrations had helped make the local Protestant community feel more welcome in the city. “Thatplayed a huge role in getting people across to ious events right across the city where they felt, you know what, it doesnt matterI am Protestant or Catholic or whatever background I come from I can feel part of this and I am welcome,” he said.     Mr Middleton praised ongoing cross-community projects but said it was important that they had an impact and were not just tokenism. “There needs to be a feeling thatwe are going to be involved in this, then there is going to be a genuine partnership, it is not tick box exercise. We want a lasting legacy from some of the projects we are going to be involved in.” Sinn Fein Foyle MLA Martina Anderson also spoke at this weeks event and said there were some very positives from the new report. She also praised the cross-community work of local groups and said that efforts must continue to make people from a Protestant background feel welcome in the local area. “As someone who had felt that I was born into a state that did not want me or welcome me, I do not want people in the Protestant unionist loyalist community that they are in a city which doesnt want them or welcome them,” she said. “The fact that the research has said that a signicant number of them feel that they are not wanted or that they feel that the other community wants them to leave. “I certainly do not want people from the Protestant unionist loyalist community to leave. “I think the research is a great foundation stone on which we can build to outreach and engage respectfully and have conversations going forward,” she added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This is the daunting schedule facing Connor Coyle next week as he steps into the ring for the first time in  months. The Derry middleweight will fly to Mexico for the equivalent of a long weekend as he aims to get his professional career back on track in . The -year-old, who is -, has not been in action since January last year when he defeated Miguel Dumas, and he is eager to get going once again. On April th, he will step into the ring in Chihuahua, Mexico against hometown boxer Esteban Villalba , after a break of  days due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. googletag.cmd.push It has been a long, long wait for Coyle, who has never stopped training in the hope that he would get the phone call for his next fight. “I didn’t think I would have been out this long. I’m just happy that there’s now something in front of me,” he said. “It’s completely dferent when you have a focus. I haven’t stopped training since my last fight but you push yourself to a dferent level when you have a fight in front of you. You feel a massive dference in the gym when you now you have a focus, especially trying to get your weight down. googletag.cmd.push “You need that motivation and that hunger to be training for something. The excitement is there and I have a lot more energy because I am pushing myself for something, rather than just ticking over and training to keep myself in shape. Because I haven’t stopped from my previous fight, that helped keep the momentum up whenever I really had to put the head down.”  Daunting Schedule There is no doubting that Coyle faces a dficult schedule next week. He has very little time to adapt to the change in setting, with what plans to be a hectic few days, with just two days in Mexico before he steps into the ring.      “I’ve never done this before,” he admitted. “I know when I travel to Florida I arrive at night time and sleep that night so I’m up fresh the next morning to go training. This is basically going to be the same thing. I’m flying over at night-time so when I get over I’ll be able to get some rest and get up and weigh in and rest again until the fight. I don’t think I’ll have any problems because it’s straight over and back. I’ll probably feel it coming back because it will catch up with me but on the way over I think I’ll be okay.” Villalba will be Coyle’s third Mexican opponent in succession, but despite a rather inconsistent record, the Derry man is expecting this particular Mexican to be on a dferent level. “I don’t know too much about him but I know he’s a tough operator and he’s very, very durable,” he explained. “We’re fighting in his home town so he’ll have no travelling to do, he’ll get up out of his bed and go and weigh in, or go and fight or whatever. He’ll be well rested. “All Mexicans are tough operators so I’ll be going into the lion’s den in this one and I’ll be expecting hard rounds, so hopefully we can get him out of there early. My last two opponents were Mexican, but this guy takes it to another level. He’ll be tougher.” Ultimately, the goal for Coyle is to get back to America, with this fight seen as something of a warm up for the real action when he gets back to the States. “They are making it very dficult with the travelling and the restrictions so I’m going to try and make the most of it when I go where and stay for a few fights,” he stated. poundIf all goes well and I go over in August or September, I’ll possibly stay until Christmas time and get in as many fights as I can until then.” Sponsors Connor would like to thank the following sponsors for their continued support, especially during such a dficult time. They are: Thirsty Goat, Celebrity Slots, Classique Floor Designs, Central Site Development, Doire Designs, The Bentley Bar, Conor Curleys Cars, Frankie Ramseys, Brooklands Fencing, Archibald Construction, RB Tiling Services, Pauls Butchers and Olympus Fitness. He would also like to give a huge thanks St. Josephs Boxing Coach Cahir Duffy for the last  weeks of training as well as Strength and Conditioning coach Kyle Wallace.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He said she declined.ldquoThis scheme has been shovel ready for some time, the MP continued.ldquoIndeed, all the geotechnical surveys, public consultations and the legal stages have been complete and in order many months ago. Yet the Minister refuses to sign-off on a commencement order.ldquoThe failure to even provide a detailed, logical explanation as to why she has not yet signed off on this scheme has created a growing fear in the local community that she is inexplicably stalling on this eagerly awaited project.The MP said that once again last weekend Ballynahinch suffered chronic congestion, with cars queued for miles to get through the town on Sunday evening as people ed home from visiting the area.Mr Hazzard warned that this will be a scene repeated each and every weekend and in the opposite direction each weeknight as commutershome from work outside Ballynahinch when Covid- restrictions ease again in the time ahead.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason, who is also calling for a start date for the bypass, said the ldquotimely delivery of the long overdue roads scheme would be a great boost for both the local economy and the wellbeing of the community.She added: ldquoThe Minister must bring this issue to a speedy conclusion as soon as possible, sign the commencement order and announce a date for construction to commence.

Itrsquos a point that anglers disagree with.DERA explained the work on the banks of the river created two dedicated disabled parking spaces in the car park where previously there had been none.ldquoThere was no legal requirement to consult on the proposed improvement works and therefore the consultation undertaken went beyond what was required, to specically noty as well as seek comment and feedback from site users, said a departmental official.He also confirmed that notice of DAERArsquos intention to carry out improvement work was clearly displayed at the Quoile site in advance of it being undertaken.The official also confirmed that consultation on the car park investment was initiated with Newry, Mourne and Down Council and a number of local councillors who were contacted by telephone about the proposed investment.DAERA confirmed that regular tree inspections are carried out at the Quoile River and that after storms, areas of the Quoile Nature Reserve are checked by staff for fallen trees and branches that may have come down.In addition, it says this area is subject to regular visual inspections by staff and where any concerns are identied, advice will be sought from qualied tree surgeons or arboriculturists any necessary work carried out.In his letter to anglers, the DAERA official said he appreciates that it was not satisfactory for disabled anglers to make their way to access current angling facilities a quarter of a mile from the car park, confirming plans for two new educated stands to meet the needs of those with mobility problems.A spokesman for Downpatrick anglers said they have never suggested that there was a dedicated disabled fishing stand at the car park before it was redeveloped. He said fishermen could fish in the river at the car park from their wheelchairs as there was a small wall in place.ldquoSince the car park was redeveloped, a barrier has been attached to the wall which now makes it impossible for disabled anglers to fish from this location. As a result, they have to make their way, along with all their gear, to another stand which is a quarter of a mile away, he said.ldquoThis is highly unsatisfactory. Would it be proper to tell someone with mobility issues who stops in a car park to be told that the shopping centre, GP surgery or disabled toilet that they needed to visit was half a mile away  I suspect not.The spokesman added local anglers have been told about plans for disabled fishing stands at the car park for some time now and that the Environment Agency is being asked for its view.ldquoWhat we want to see is delivery for disabled anglers. They have rights which must be recognised, he said.The spokesman added: ldquoWe remain in the eye of a pandemic and mental health is a major issue for many health professionals who are concerned about the fall-out from the impact of the coronavirus.

Since  it has been redeveloped and sympathetically extended by local builder Trevor Nelson, but I would say itrsquos only really finished now,itrsquos ever finished.When Richard and his mother, both of whom are originally from Crossgar, bought the house, it came along with birds nests and the usual natural build-up that empty houses accrue over the years.They could see the potential of the Coach Horse Lane home in a mill development with views of the local rolling hills and have been delighted with it ever since.ldquoItrsquos all open plan upstairs and has all of the original window ledges with open granite stonework and open beams with a sunroom and a large living room, said Richard.While he has been more focused on the interior of the house, the garden has been his motherrsquos domain.However, the homersquos interior reflects both their love of quirky and edgy looks and furnishings.ldquoIt was quite tricky to get the balance right. As itrsquos quite an old building, I did not want to go down the route of the old clicheacute of pitch pine and the Laura Ashley look, said Richard. ldquoItrsquos a real mixture as there is some very modern furniture which is married together with antiques. You have to be very exacting. It may not be everyonersquos cup of tea but the basis is traditional with very modern elements.Richard did not seek out entry to the competition rather the producers came to him.He said: ldquoI was approached by the programme makers through Instagram which is a surprise as even though Irsquom an interior designer, I donrsquot toot too much about my own house.ldquoNormally they would have come out to see the house before it was selected but because of Covid I had to give them a video tour of the house and they said they would be delighted to feature it.Neither Richard nor his mother were allowed to be at home when the three judges called to view the house lastSeptember, but he revealed the filming took two days in total.ldquoThe judges never meet the home owners as the house should speak for itself, he said.ldquoIt was a real experience as therersquos a lot of prep that goes into it. Therersquos a lot of disclaimers and I wasnrsquot allowed to talk about it until the week before.

Boris Johnson advised public buildings, including theatres, to close and mass gatherings to stop.This week,  months on, campaign group We Make Events Cymru, reflects on the impact of Covid- and how the lockdown restrictions has had a devastating effect on their industry.The impact of the announcement back in March last year meant that the UK event sector came to an outright standstill, resulting in events being cancelled, theatre and music shows could not be staged and thousands of Welsh event professionals could not work.We Make Events Cymru, , has spent the last  months lobbying the Welsh Government to highlight the need for continued sector support in order for the events organisers, iniduals and supply chain to survive Covid- restrictions.After a year of campaigning, We Make Events Cymru continues to push for opportunities to re-open the sector in light of the Welsh Government Coronavirus Control Plan , which does not allow gatherings of more than  people in Tier .As a result of many conversations with the Welsh Government, We Make Events Cymru has created a survey to gather the much needed data to evidence the number of people involved in the sector and the contribution they make to Wales and its economy.Stephen Burkitt-Harrington, Director of Production  one of Walesrsquo leading Creative Events Companies, said: ldquoThe Welsh Government has been saying all along that it could not reopen events of any kind without industry specic data. We were surprised to learn that they were not collecting this information though.\"This is why we have put together the biggest survey of our industry ever undertaken in Wales. Companies big and small, venues, events, and every inidual involved in even the smallest way can contribute now.\"By giving us as little or as much as people are prepared to contribute, we can then provide the government with the much talked about data they say they need to see how valuable our wide ranging industry is to the Welsh economy, and how important it is to get it open again as soon as it is safe to.Alongside the survey, the group have also recently launched their own website which gives sector colleagues access to wellbeing and financial advice, access to a database of Welsh event organisers, suppliers and iniduals, as well as a forum to chat and exchange ideas ndash resources that the team believe is vitally important during the pandemic.MORE NEWS:We Make Events Cymru is in regular dialogue with Welsh Government to lobby, and is part of the working party preparing for Covid-safe outdoor and indoor test events. These test events are an integral stepping-stone to get the industry in Wales back working again .Sarah Hemsley-Cole, Director of Cardf based SC Productions and the Lead Coordinator for the campaign said: ldquoWhilst we have to accept large mass gatherings are not possible in  ndash it is essential that we keep up the pressure on Welsh Government to allow covid safe cultural activities in the Summer of .\"We are a creative and innovative sector, and by working with Welsh Government to develop appropriate guidance and to generate factual data and evidence from the test events, we can get performers, artists, technicians and the eco system back to work and audiences back to what they love.Working alongside partners such as Equity, Creu Cymru, BECTU, Cardf Music Board, Cult Cymru, Freelancers Make Theatre Work Freelances Task Force, What About Weddings and The Musicians Union ndash We Make Events Cymru has helped give the industry and events people a crucial voice during these unprecedented times.Following on from the recent budget announcement, We Make Events Cymru acknowledge the essential package of support already received from the UK and Welsh governments, and is pleased to hear of the further support expected with the extension of furlough, additional SEISS grants ndash which now includes newcomers to the industry who started their businesses in the   tax year, as well as the Cultural Recovery Fund.We Make Events Cymru are now waiting to hear about additional financial aid and get a better understanding of how long this relief money is expected to last business and iniduals in Wales. There are still thousands across the country who have been excluded from any kind of financial support ndash these people need to be recognised and also offered funding.The campaign group is also calling for the events industry to be considered on a par with other industries like hospitality and the Film and TV sector for things such as insurance and financial schemes.The UK is internationally recognised for delivering impressive cultural events. Within it, Wales plays a signicant role with its tremendous highly skilled workforce, many of whom have now had to ersy to work in other jobs.The impact of the lockdown will be felt within the Welsh events industry for many years to come. Rhys Maule, Managing Director of ProLX Productions in Cwmbran said: ldquoThe loss of extremely talented, hard working and dedicated professionals is really hard to see.\"These people are being backed into a corner as a result of no support and canrsquot see any way out other than to change career and move onto something more secure. Lots of these people feel they may neveras the risk is too great, which is devastating, and the impact on their metal health as a result of this is hard to hear.He added ldquoThe huge number of people falling through the gaps not receiving funding is something that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency to ensure the future of our industry.The COVID- pandemic has caused many events around Wales and the UK to be cancelled or postponed due the government-imposed restrictions on large gatherings. Among the most prominent events to be affected in Wales in  have been the National Eisteddfod, the Royal Welsh Show, Hay Festival, Abergavenny Food Festival, Cardf Half Marathon, Llangollen International Eisteddfod, Green Man and Ironman. Many of these have also been postponed for .In August  event organisations from across the UK joined forces to bring attention to the critical condition of the live events industry by lighting venues and iconic buildings in red. Wales Millennium Centre, Motorpoint Arena Cardf, Pontio,Venue Cymru and Aberystwyth Arts Centre were just some of the venues that lent their support to the campaign.We Make Events Cymru is calling on anyone who contributes to events in Wales and its eco-system to complete the survey in order to evidence the valuable contribution the sector makes in Wales.For more information about the survey, visit: https:www.wemakeevents.cymru . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe road would link Sycamore Cross on the A with Junction  of the M. A -week public consultation last year raised concerns about the impact on the environment and local communities.Responding to those concerns, the Vale of Glamorgan council has now said transport planners must analyse further how the road would fit in with the new context of Covid- and the climate emergency.In a report to the councilrsquos cabinet, which meets on Monday, March , detailed responses were given to the main concerns raised in the consultation. The cabinet will be asked to approve further analysis, before moving on to writing up a full business case for the road.The case for the road is to improve transport across the region, including to Cardf Airport, St Athanrsquos Enterprise Zone, and new housing developments. It would likely cost around pound million to build, and is dependent on funding from the Welsh Government.However, the proposals have drawn criticism from villagers in Pendoylan whose houses would be knocked down, cyclists using country lanes which could be blocked off, and Coed Cymru which has warned ancient woodland would be felled to make way for the road.Two options for the new road were consulted on: one to the east of Pendoylan and one to the west. The report revealed transport planners are edging towards the western route, as it is better value for money than the eastern one.As well as suggesting further analysis, the cabinet report addressed the main concerns including the impact on the climate, environment, walkers and cyclists, and uncertain future of the financially struggling Cardf Airport.On cycling, the new road would include a segregated lsquoactive travel routersquo for cyclists and walkers, the report said. Country lanes blocked off could have bridges or underpasses for walkers and cyclists to cross the new road.     MORE NEWS:The report said: ldquoThere is currently poor infrastructure and local connectivity by walking and cycling through the study area, and there is potential to implement new cycle connections. An active travel route is an integral component of the concept options.ldquoShould a preferred option progress to the next stage of assessment and a need to block the lanes confirmed, access for non-motorised users to safely cross under or over the bypass would be accommodated as part of the design.On climate change, campaigners raised concerns a new road would increase private car journeys and carbon emissions.Both the Welsh Government and the Vale council declared a climate emergency in , pledging to reduce carbon emissions in an effort to prevent catastrophic increases in global temperatures.A big part of the plan to reduce emissions in Wales is changing how people travel: fewer journeys in private cars and more by walking, cycling and in public transport.The report said further analysis would include a lsquocarbon assessment and climate resiliencersquo report, and would explore how to reduce the carbon impact of the road.It did not mention what these methods could include.Several areas of ancient woodland would have ldquovery large adverse impacts according to the report. But further assessment would examine the exact effects of the loss of that woodland.The report said: ldquoThe environmental assessment would examine the loss of woodland in terms of its use in flood retention, water quality, social value, carbon capture, landscape value and cultural heritage value, as well as its value to bioersity.If the ldquovery large adverse impacts canrsquot be avoided by redesigning the road, new trees could be planted where to compensate for the loss of ancient woodland.This would include moving and replanting some of the old trees and soil.The next stage would also include a wider, detailed environmental impact assessment, and recommendations on how to mitigate potential impacts on the environment surrounding the proposed road.Another concern raised has been the uncertain future of Cardf Airport, which was recently bailed out by the Welsh Government with a pound. million grant.But transport planners pointed to plans to make it easier to get to the airport on foot, by bike, bus, train, and in private motor vehicles.The cabinet report said: ldquoWhile recognising that the basis of future studies would increasingly need to consider the emerging trends and patterns resulting from Covid-, it is understood that the long-term vision of the airport remains at this present time.Responding to the report, campaigners have renewed calls for the Vale council to scrap the plans for the road altogether.A spokesperson for Vale Communities for Future Generations said: ldquoWhy the Vale of Glamorgan council is persisting in wasting public money on keeping this outdated road plan alive is hard to understand. The sheer volume of recent objections to the proposal clearly indicates the public has other priorities.ldquoThe original  Vale council assumption was that the road was needed for better vehicle access to Cardf Airport mdash which was denied by the airport management.ldquoSince then the airportrsquos passenger numbers have shrunk, millions of pounds of public money has been spent by the Welsh Government on propping it up financially and the future of air travel globally is uncertain post Covid  pandemic.ldquoThese are hardly the circumstances under which to continue promoting an expensive and environmentally destructive road building plan that was developed before the Vale of Glamorgan council and the Welsh Government declared a climate emergency in .ldquoIt is time for this plan to be recognised as a prime example of outdated thinking, and finally scrapped so that Vale of Glamorgan council can prioritise spending on environmentally sound projects. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Traders have got to remember that.Residents and friends Tracey Scott and Debra Cooper have enjoyed visiting the unusually quiet beach at weekdays through the pandemic, but said they will avoid the seafront this weekend.ldquoI hope people continue to be weary, Ms Scott, who lives alone at her home in Llandough, said. ldquoBut it seems to me recently people have stopped social distancing as much.ldquoI come here with friends and family sometimes three times a week, but I have to avoid it on weekends now.ldquoThere are just hordes of people not keeping to social distancing rules. Itrsquos a great shame.ldquoI walked with my mother here not long ago and was being bumped into by people. I canrsquot put myself at risk, and I canrsquot put others at risk.ldquoItrsquos so dficult because I live alone and I keep away from people Irsquod very much like to hug. Then someone comes and brushes past me. I know it sounds odd, but you do feel almost violated when that happens.ldquoItrsquos dficult, because I really do want the businesses to thrive here and I would like to support them on the weekends.ldquoMy message to people would be lsquogive it time, and letrsquos play it safe ndash donrsquot all rush at oncersquo.Ms Scottrsquos son and his partner, in their twenties, are also avoiding weekend trips to the seafront due to her son having asthma.Ms Cooper said: ldquoFor months now Irsquove only gone out in the week because it gets so busy. Itrsquos strange ndash the nice weather comes and the residents keep out the way.Hugh Pickford, who owns Pickfordrsquos Gallery and Bar With Rooms on the seafront, says he feels for residents, and itrsquos become dficult for traders to police overcrowding.ldquoItrsquos probably bred by us not being able to open indoors and police the situation ourselves, he said.Social distancing signs remain after the road had to be temporarily closed due to people packing the Esplanade over ChristmasldquoAt the moment people come and get a takeaway and go across the road. The problem is thatrsquos what everyone is doing. It doesnrsquot look great at times. But what can we do ldquoOver Christmas it looked almost like a carnival atmosphere to be honest.ldquoIrsquod like to look on the bright side. The seafront has really seen a revival in the last couple of years. Even at am now Piotr at Stol Coffee draws a crowd here. Itrsquos nice to see.That revival is continuing this weekend too as a new cafeacute opens inside the Pier Pavilion.The new rules mean the Pickfords can open their rooms to all people in Wales again.Hugh PickfordldquoWersquove not had much interest at the moment in the rooms, he said. ldquoPeople booked for April and then cancelled when they realised it was room service only. People donrsquot seem to want to eat off the premises or in their rooms, so thatrsquos hitting us a bit.ldquoWersquore looking forward to the summer. With staycation season likely to be ahead of us, it should be a great place to be.What you saidResidents have been responding when asked what they thought of the new changes.Jo Broad, from Blackwood, predicted: ldquoPeople will go crazy. Of course we need our lives back or at least some sort of normality. The beaches will be full again.ldquoLetrsquos hope people will be sensible, not go crazy, and letrsquos hope for safety, or I think there might be a summer lockdown coming.Newport resident Lisa Edwards said: ldquoPeople need to stop hiding behind the government. We are in charge of our own destiny and we have to resume some normality.ldquoTo do this, we need to be allowed to resume living, but sensibly.
