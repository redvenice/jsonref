The result is a supernatural riot that whisks you back to his Wirral youth, with help from music, adverts and old film footageIt’s dark in here and distant traffic can be heard thundering overhead. Mark Leckey has turned some of the ground floor galleries at Tate Britain into a single open space, transforming it into a life-sized mock-up of a motorway underpass in the Wirral, over which thrums the M53 traffic. There’s a concrete ramp and pillars – and the skylights have partially obscured by the supposed underside of the motorway bridge. This is Leckey’s O’ Magic Power of Bleakness, which presents this new work, called Under Under In, alongside two earlier videos: 1999’s Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore, and Dream English Kid 1964-1999 AD, from 2015.The motorway bridge, which appeared in Dream English Kid, is more than just a stage setting. Growing up close by, Leckey remembers it as a place of mystery as well as escape for neighbourhood kids, a feral no man’s land – and a portal to another world. A familiar trope in children’s literature – from CS Lewis to Alan Garner, JK Rowling and Philip Pullman – the prosaic entrance to an unseen world, a flaw in the fabric of reality, is an enduring fantasy. Leckey experienced something here, and it hasn’t gone away.The kids in Leckey’s M53 Plato’s Cave are first spotted high on the ramp, far above us and just beneath the road above. Distant, and shot in black and white, they are far away both in space and time. On a number of smaller screens, at ground level, we see them in their hoodies and balaclavas, their spookiness undercut by Adidas logos. The kids are all right, scaring each other as kids always do. “You’re away with the fairies, Mark!” someone shouts, in this 50-minute melange of new work and old, all folded together into something that is both haunted house and house music rave, journey into the past and premonition of the future. Leckey is having fun in this captivating and strange world.The motorway bridge, another kid tells us, was built on an old straight track, and we are plunged, onscreen, into successive undercrofts, filled with monoliths and neolithic chambers. It is a supernatural riot down here. The lights go on and off, spotlights sheer the gloom, and a dull sodium pallor casts the concrete, and us, a sickly yellow.Leckey’s work is like a time machine. I hear the grinding of the Tardis’s gears, and see shadows on the wall, and a little boy playing alone in a winter garden. Maybe it is Leckey himself. Maybe we are meant to think so. I hear, too, the echo of old advertising jingles. The smiling face of Tony the Tiger from the Kellogg’s Frosties ad (“They’re grrrreat!!!”) floats by. Carry On star Liz Fraser is doing her makeup and the carpet’s all swirly. These and other product placements pitch us back to the 1960s in Leckey’s mix of old TV and movie footage, amateur film shot at dancehalls, raves and northern soul gigs. Flares are flapping, fags are lit, the dancefloor’s heaving.O’ Magic Power of Bleakness is an invocation of childhood and youth, but also a picture of a period, of the modernity of motorways and 60s shopping precincts, of three-day weeks and Liverpool under Thatcherism, of the Mersey beat and Madchester, Joy Division gigs and leaden pianos accompanying muffled Sunday choirs. The four-to-the-floor beats, Ian Curtis’s on-stage manic gyrations and ravers dancing on E carry us along down our own rivers of memory.Leckey is in there somewhere, reliving his past. Although he never planned it this way, the two earlier works projected large on a plain wall fit seamlessly. Childhood wonders and terrors (what lurks beneath the underpass? Did something die here?) and the possibility of escape through a youth culture that hadn’t entirely been monetised even in the 1980s, make a potent mix.O’ Magic Power of Bleakness is all about escape routes, real and imaginary, and their impossibility. If the show is a kind of Bildungsroman, and a homage to the music he loves, it is also a sideways nod to the fact that Leckey made his own escape, in the days before student loans and the capitalisation of higher education, into art. Romanticism runs through Leckey’s work, but it is leavened by a strong, prickly, necessary streak of realism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/376bfae521c084234c325a5890c76f846d9f2ae0/1044_0_5011_3006/master/5011.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8c593344e7121addd38af0a1fff8558","title":"untapped treasure wallace collection to start lending artworks","story":"World-renowned London collection to allow loans after review of Lady Wallace’s willTreasures from one of the world’s finest collections of art, armoury, furniture and porcelain are to be made available for loans to galleries nationally and internationally for the first time in 119 years.The Wallace Collection in London includes superstar paintings such as Frans Hals’ The Laughing Cavalier, Diego Velázquez’s The Lady with a Fan and Nicolas Poussin’s A Dance to the Music of Time.But none have ever been permitted to leave. The collection, bequeathed to the nation in 1897, has always been considered a closed collection because of the terms of a will left by Lady Wallace.It was announced on Tuesday that lawyers and art experts had re-examined the terms of the will and decided they did not prevent loans, a conclusion endorsed by the UK government and the Charity Commission.The decision will herald a revolution for the Wallace Collection, its director, Xavier Bray, said. “For me it is a bit like the Hobbit and you see that dragon just sitting on the treasure, not letting anybody get close to it. This is a major new chapter for the Wallace, it’s likely to be transformative in terms of how we work and how our curators and conservation staff think about the collection.”The banker António Horta-Osório, who chairs the trustees, said it represented a hugely significant moment in the history of the collection. “It will enable us to put the collection in the 21st century.”The Wallace Collection has been housed in Hertford House in central London since 1870 and opened to the public as a museum in 1900.Bray was appointed three years ago and made challenging the loans policy a priority. “We are in central London and have this great collection but it has been rather isolating,” he said. “Working at the Wallace is quite a monastic existence because people know they will never get anything out of you.”The interpretation of the bequest has meant its Hals has never been seen alongside another Hals the same for its Velázquez. When the National Gallery this year put on display five of six works from Titian’s “poesie” paintings, the sixth one remained at the Wallace.The gallery also has arguably the most important collection of 18th-century French art outside France, with masterpieces by Jean-Honoré Fragonard, Jean-Antoine Watteau, François Boucher and Eugène Delacroix. Its collection of princely arms and armour is considered world-class. None of it has ever been lent.“The collection has been very static,” said Bray. “Art historically, from my point of view, it is a revolution. It means that we can start really understanding our collection better by juxtaposing it with other objects from other collections.”The Wallace stressed that loans, beginning in 2020, would be approved on an exceptional basis. “We will start slowly and then we will see how things go,” said Horta-Osório, the chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group.The interpretation has been based on a line that the collection “shall remain together … unmixed with other objects”. Bray said this did not mean loans were expressly forbidden, pointing out that Sir Richard Wallace was a proud and enthusiastic lender of objects.“This is a beautiful, untapped treasure which of course we will look after for future generations … things that can’t travel will not travel. But if things are done well and according to the rules, it is like bringing fresh air to the collection and just making it live again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/908ce228a412be4d6f5f776c8f89301febbf532e/0_0_5471_3655/master/5471.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=936dcf8e1f1856e002e47d42a15163e0","title":"it has saved countless lives readers picks of the best books this century","story":"After we published our list of the greatest books since 2000, you sent in your own suggestions – from Chinese sci-fi to a history of music“London: The Biography by Peter Ackroyd (2000) made me fall in love with London all over again.

But when a series grabs you, you are putty in its hands. The last Artemis Fowl book came out in 2012, having lit up the pre-teen market in the 00s with a complex antihero, aggressive fairies and futuristic thriller plots. Fans of Eoin Colfer – or their younger siblings – will be relieved that the Fowl name rides again.In The Fowl Twins (HarperCollins) Artemis’s younger twin brothers, Myles and Beckett, are home alone on their fortified island examining a miniature troll when a deranged nobleman starts shooting and a Spanish nun arrives with Inquisitorial intentions. Colfer’s playfulness is in full swing, as puns fly and physics bends to the machinations of the twins, who are just as bad (or should that be good?) as Artemis. It is, inevitably, the start of a new series.Sally Gardner has been absent from the middle-years lists for some time, too. Although not quite as much of a household name, the prize-winning Gardner is another dab hand at literary world-creation. Fourteen years have passed since Gardner’s last middle-years novel, I Coriander, and her latest, Invisible in a Bright Light (Zephyr), is set in a Copenhagen theatre full of backstage drama. Her assured plot swings audaciously between alternate realities, as another pair of twins, Maria and Celeste, are forced to play a confounding, dangerous dream-game: the Reckoning. The prize is the lives of their parents, and the lives of the rest of the passengers of a ship that might, or might not, have been lost at sea in the Baltic in 1870.Anyone browsing a bookshop’s children’s section in 2018 won’t have missed The House With Chicken Legs, shortlisted for a clutch of awards. The Girl Who Speaks Bear (Usborne) is not a sequel as such, but it finds second-time author Sophie Anderson ing back into the wintry wilderness of Russian folk tales. That fantastically mobile house – or one very like it – comes back, a best supporting actor in this adventure about belonging. The girl of the title is misfit Yanka, fostered by a village herbalist after being part-raised by a bear. But who – or what – is Yanka really, torn as she is between the call of the wild and her loved ones? As strange transformations befall her, she sets off one dark night to find out.Hilary McKay’s The Skylarks’ War was another hit of 2018. Her latest outing, The Time of Green Magic (Macmillan Children’s Books), is even less of a sequel, but one of those books whose title doesn’t do justice to the thrills (and skills) within. A house features prominently: an eerie doer-upper in contemporary London festooned with ivy, in which two recently merged families are trying to establish a new normal.Despite the gothic vibes, Abi’s family fall in love with the place and manage to raise cash to pay the rent just before they are evicted. McKay balances out Abi’s very down-to-earth concerns – missing her Jamaican granny, her new stepbrothers, the teenage Max and the younger Louis – and the slow creep of the fantastical. This is magic without whimsy, a story about secrets and the power of books, with enough edge-of-the-seat moments to keep you hugging a cushion.In the US, more open-ended, hip-hop-inspired “novels” in verse have been in circulation for some time. In the Key of Code (Walker) is a highlight in that relatively recent tradition. Aimee Lucido’s debut is told in the form of poems, liberally littered with computer code and musical terminology.It is a daring exercise in form that carries its story very well. New girl Emmy, 12, is the unmusical child of musicians, and starting school in San Francisco. As she navigates the mean-girl social codes and a tense home life, coding club becomes an unlikely sanctuary.

Set in the US in the 1940s, it recalled Colm Tóibín’s Brooklyn in its quiet, tightly written intensity, a novel like salt on the tongue. Her follow-up, The River Capture, is a more peculiar thing. As elegantly written as her previous book, it is more obscure in its intentions, more adventurous in its ambitions.The river of the title is the Sullane in Waterford, where Luke O’Brien has returned to the family farm, Ardboe, after time teaching in Dublin. Luke is a James Joyce scholar, and obsessed with Leopold Bloom, hero of Ulysses. He felt “an itch, a longing – a necessity even – to stay close to Bloom, to inhabit him day and night”. He has vague dreams of writing a book about Joyce (although he can’t find anything original to say about him), or establishing a school whose curriculum would be “devised using one source, Ulysses, a work of genius, as the base text from which myriad other texts will follow”. Costello has great fun dripping quotes from Joyce into the text. This is a full-frontal assault on the anxiety of influence. Luke’s life is slow, quietly unhappy (he thinks he might be bipolar, but isn’t sure) and filled with a single question: “What to do today?” Often, the answer is to go and visit his aunt, Ellen, who lives nearby and, apart from a sister in Australia, is the last family Luke has.Into this world comes Ruth Mulvey, a few years younger than him, looking for a home for her uncle’s dog. Despite Luke revealing a secret from his past that initially unsettles Ruth, they spend more and more time together, write emails (his are long, hers short) and fall in love. Towards the end of the book, Costello explains the novel’s title: “When a river erodes the land and acquires the flow from another river or drainage system, usually below it, the first river is said to have captured the second in an act of piracy.” Ruth comes into Luke’s ordered, gentle life and seizes possession of it.This geological metaphor also seems to nod to the radical stylistic change that takes place two-thirds of the way through the book, when it moves into a kind of dispute with the self, all of it in language that is increasingly Joycean. Questions are posed and answered, there are long passages of exquisite and impressionistic prose, Luke’s mind appears to have been unblocked, and all comes rushing forth.There’s a telling reference early in the novel to Peter Wohlleben. In the free indirect style of Luke’s narrative, he remembers “that German forester who wrote about the hidden life of trees, how they are bound together in families, communicating through a web of underground fungi. Mycelium. Sending warning signals when danger approaches…”It’s a potent foreshadowing of the novel’s ending, when Luke’s devotion to his family, his willingness to let go of the past, and his love for Ruth are all tested. His response, like much of the book, is beautifully crafted but baffling.This review is from the Observer• The River Capture by Mary Costello is published by Canongate (£14.99).

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Let’s open with a bang, as safereturndoubtful recommends Smonk by Tom Franklin:Smonk opens with a real bang, the first four chapters are amongst the most savage and grotesque as I have read in fiction. It’s 1911 in Alabama and EO Smonk and Evavangeline, both thoroughly despicable characters, are running amok on separate paths of destruction, sharing some bit characters in their storylines, but otherwise remaining oblivious of each other’s existence as they move toward the day of reckoning… Alone, as a blood-bath western this would have limited appeal, but with the imagery created by his terse character descriptions and his deft application of black humour make it stand-out as an outstanding work in the southern gothic genre.Death in Captivity by Michael Gilbert has inspired Kincaid to make a “major shout-out for the British Library’s crime series”:Just a few more pages to go with Someone (a snitch?) is found dead in an uncompleted escape tunnel in an Italian prison camp. Who did it? The Allies are in Sicily. When will they invade Italy, and where? Will the Germans show up in the POW camp? So many what will happens when.My Sister, the Serial Killer by Oyinkan Braithwaite has won over jimitron5000:There were a couple of things, namely the garish green on the cover and the positive review by a bookseller whose tastes seem diametrically opposed to mine, that told me I shouldn’t like it. But I did, I really enjoyed it. Although the title suggests plenty of murder in the book, it more an exploration of family loyalty and sisterly binds. Punchy and sprinkled with humour, it is a good quick read.JG Farrell’s Singapore Grip is “marvellous, as you would expect from this author,” writes SydneyH:The main thing I’ll take from it is the foolhardiness of engaging in war with Germany and Japan simultaneously, the two countries most likely to be extremely competent and efficient at it – though there obviously wasn’t much choice in the matter. After the strike on America’s fleet in Pearl Harbour, Japan were in control of the Asia Pacific, and there wasn’t much that Britain, Australia and India could do about it, especially after key battleships were sunk. The bombing of Singapore is something I was not familiar with, so it was all very interesting. If the novel isn’t quite as satisfying as Troubles, it’s probably because of the emphasis on the economic pressures that led to the tensions in the region. Also, I felt that the ending left too many tales unfinished.Pseudaletia is persevering with The Flounder by Gunter Grass:… A book I have started twice but never got past about page five. I dug it out, and I think this time it has ‘taken’. I really enjoy the mix of real and surreal. I’m not far enough into it to talk about it’s meaning, etc, but so far it’s entertaining and thoughtful.We Don’t Die of Love by Stephen May has won over pubbore:A lovely little book about masculinity in crisis. A man pushing 60 struggles to find a purpose after his wife leaves and he finds his business under threat. A bit like Nick Hornby, if he wrote about older working class men in the post-industrial north - sad, real, ultimately hopeful.Vasily Grossman’s Stalingrad is “very long” says paulburns, but that “doesn’t matter”:It’s a stunning achievement, one of the great literary masterpieces to come out of Russia in the twentieth century. Through the lives of several families, (not just the Shaposhnikovs, for those of you who have read Life and Fate ) and various iniduals, Grossman tells the story of the opening stages of the Battle for Stalingrad and its effect on the whole of Soviet society. His scope is epic and for the most part, transcends the limits of Socialist Realism imposed on him by the cultural elite. A lot of my pleasure came from how I was surprised by how Grossman portrayed events (and I thought I knew the battle of Stalingrad pretty well) so I’m refusing to engage in a series of spoilers. Read and enjoy. Delight! In a strange way it might make some weeks of this terrible year easier to bear.Finally, Vesca has just finished Robinson by the great Muriel Spark:It’s not as dark than others of hers I’ve read, which may be because it’s only her second book. Our heroine wakes up on a privately owned island after a plane crash. She and two very different men are the only survivors. Other than that there’s only a young boy and the owner and resident, Robinson. But who is Robinson?Now I want to know too.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

And their money was on the airline collapsing.For the second time in the space of two years, the Civil Aviation Authority was secretly putting together its own pop-up airline, and this was even bigger than the last one, assembled to repatriate stranded Monarch passengers in 2017.Some 150,000 Thomas Cook customers had flown abroad on holiday, many blissfully unaware that the return leg was in jeopardy. The CAA regulated Thomas Cook in two ways: through its airline operating certificate and its Atol licence, which guarantees customers their holiday should a firm go bust. Both involved scrutinising its finances for solvency. The Atol licence was due for renewal in two weeks. And the CAA had seen enough.Hope of a rescue deal still officially remained: banks extending credit or even the government stepping in. But despite that hope, Operation Matterhorn was launched.Discreet feelers had been put out for weeks, discussed under the Matterhorn codename to minimise the risk of leaks, to assess the availability of potential rescue aircraft. The grounding of the 737 Max posed an additional headache: other airlines were already using airline leasing firms to fill their schedules.But the CAA had been here before, and honed its act. The rescue of XL Airways passengers after that went bust in 2008 wasn’t perfect – officials still joke about dodgy jumbos – but the blueprint has been clear since two Monarch operations: one in 2016 that was eventually not needed as the airline hung on for grim life, and then the successful repatriation when it collapsed a year later.With non-disclosure agreements signed, and handling firms and airline operations teams sounded out in commercial confidence, CAA officials in the Canary Wharf HQ had laid out a plan for almost 50 planes to plug the gaps.It would take at least 48 hours to get alternative aircraft into position to run the Thomas Cook schedule – and that meant paying out for an entire shadow operation even though the airline could, conceivably, still be taking passengers on Monday.It also risked precipitating the very thing the CAA hoped to avoid: a collapse in consumer and investor confidence in the airline. In a world of flight-tracking website and social media, hopes for complete secrecy were faint once Matterhorn had kicked in.But the alternative to shelling out millions on substitute planes now was for the first group of Thomas Cook passengers – some 16,000 were due to fly home daily – to be stranded until Wednesday or longer.At a minimum, that would spell uncertainty and rack up hotel bills that the CAA – under Atol – would have to eventually cover. At worst, if passengers lacked accommodation, it could spell overcrowding in airports, panic and the spectre of public disorder.The button was pressed and a comprehensive website of information, matching each doomed Thomas Cook inbound flight, set to go.Volunteers at the CAA – many who had worked through the Monarch collapse in 2017 – were contacted inidually on Sunday, and posted to Gatwick and other airports around the country for 2am on Monday, ready for the announcement of Thomas Cook’s liquidation. They were to stand ready to advise any passengers arriving for flights of the overnight news, their rights and how to obtain refunds for holidays that were not to happen.The Foreign Office was meanwhile coordinating the discreet dispatch of staff to help at airports abroad – along with some Thomas Cook employees, still working for passengers without hope of a pay cheque.On Sunday night, that Malaysian Airlines A380 touched down in Manchester, part of a worldwide safety net that had brought in charter planes from the US, Canada and Portugal.Some of the contracting was straightforward: the likes of Titan Airways and Hi-Fly exist to regularly fill gaps in the scheduled airline market. They are extra planes, with pilots and crew, for hire by big names when circumstances demand.Others also stepped in to the breach, exceptionally for Matterhorn: easyJet will devote one of its 14 A320s on standby for the rescue flights, while Virgin and BA made rows of transatlantic seats available for the CAA alone.Far fewer planes will be needed next week, with no more outbound holidaymakers. The bureaucracy of dealing with tens of thousands of passengers complaints and cases through the Atol scheme is also averted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99ed6322f3f458509a44611f975d89b13aefe841/0_285_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=234eb1a2b0a76b3dee25dc6d49aace2f","title":"popular brands of uk sauce have excessive salt levels finds survey","story":"Asian products were worst offenders, with over one-third of all sauces exceeding limitsPopular brands of table sauces and marinades on sale in the UK contain “excessive and unnecessary” levels of salt, which could be putting consumers’ wellbeing at risk, a health group has warned.Action on Salt, which is based at Queen Mary University of London, is calling on the government to deliver a robust salt reduction programme for 2020 and extend targets to categories that have so far been ignored.Blue Dragon Fish Sauce has 26.7g of salt per 100ml which means that just one tablespoon would provide 4g of salt – two-thirds of an adult’s maximum recommended daily intake and the equivalent of nearly nine anchovy fillets. Also highlighted are Asda’s Dark Soy Sauce and Lee Kum Kee’s Premium Dark Soy Sauce, where just one tablespoon of provides nearly half an adult’s maximum daily salt intake.Blue Dragon’s manufacturer, AB World Foods, said in a statement: “Our Asian-style sauces and marinades are designed as food ingredients rather than as the main constituent of a meal: on that basis they are used in small quantities to flavour a range of different dishes. All of our products are clearly labelled with nutritional information, including salt content, and are designed to be enjoyed in moderation as part of a balanced diet.“Fish sauce is a traditional southeast Asian food ingredient that is commonly used as a salt replacement. Typically only a small amount of fish sauce is added to a recipe for depth of flavour.”The findings coincided with a study published in the BMJ Open, which analysed the salt content of sauces in the UK and in China. UK results suggested that over the past decade some sauces are getting saltier despite the health risks of a high salt diet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/303f36eed719806f7e89bfbdb19fbec9d055a50f/0_153_5265_3158/master/5265.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3adb8d05a5b86381ef756f215d4b2c85","title":"brexit left right voters party labour","story":"Despite the turmoil induced by the referendum, party affiliation remains strong, with many leavers likely to back LabourWe are a ided nation, torn apart by Brexit and unable even to have Christmas dinners together – or so the story goes. The 2016 referendum created a deep ide in British society around which people are increasingly positioning themselves. Some believe that this is now the defining feature of our political landscape. But while it is true that almost half of the British electorate identify “very strongly” with either leave or remain, and this can outstrip party identification, it would be wrong to imagine that any future general election will only be about this “new” politics. Older ides that have structured political behaviour in Britain for the best part of a century still have a major part to play.Looking at the values of those with very strong Brexit identities, it’s possible to see interesting “cross-pressures”. The positions people hold on subjects other than Brexit do not always line up as you might expect. This helps us to understand why someone with a strong remain identity might have ended up voting Conservative in 2017, or why someone with a strong leave identity may intend to vote Labour next time around. People’s stances on economic questions, for example, are often rooted in longstanding antagonisms that have not been entirely replaced by identities based on Brexit. Those who are very strongly attached to remain but voted Conservative in 2017 are the group most likely to have right-leaning views on the economy, for instance, while at the same time being more socially liberal than other Conservative voters. Likewise, those who identify strongly with the leave side but who voted Labour in 2017 are more likely to take leftwing economic positions, while being more socially conservative than their fellow party members who support remain.In short, the old politics of left and right, of state intervention versus market liberalism, continued to structure voting choices in 2017. It is still the key iding line between the Conservative and Labour parties. It unites the Labour vote: for example, the left may be fragmented on Brexit, but it is united on nationalising the railways and on curbs on the power of big business. These issues are not related to the EU referendum. Nor do they match up easily with the liberal-authoritarian axis that figures such as Jo Swinson have said characterise these volatile political times.For voters who seem to have voted “wrongly” in 2017 – Conservative remainers and Labour leavers – broader political goals are as important as the outcome of the never-ending Brexit process. Among Labour leavers, concerns are high about the NHS and the cost of living. Conservative remainers, while also worried about healthcare, are more likely to be preoccupied with the national economy than other groups.This, of course, has implications for any upcoming election. Brexit will simply be one of a number of issues voters factor in. While analyses suggest that a significant number of “very strong” leave identifiers who voted Labour in 2017 would be unlikely to vote for the party again (about one in four say their chances of ever voting Labour are zero), almost half say that they are “likely” to do so. Similarly, among the smaller group of Conservative voters with very strong remain identity, more than seven in 10 say they are “likely” to vote Conservative again. So even among those most wedded to a particular side in the referendum debate, the realignment of our politics is far from complete. Party loyalties seem to have been underestimated.The picture of a ided Britain is now commonplace, with commentators arguing that we have reached a state of polarisation similar to that seen in the US over the last decade. But the ides in Britain are not simply between those who voted to remain and those who voted to leave. Rather, there are now two distinct ides running through the electorate. The old separation between left and right, defined in terms of economic justice and rooted in class politics, is one. The second has been crystallised by the leave-remain binary – but it is more deeply represented by values relating to social issues. It is this ide that distinguishes Ukip voters from Green party voters, for example, something we are not able to do based on economics alone. It is also the key battleground for the Liberal Democrats, which is seeking to re-establish itself as the party for those with liberal values.These two ides cut across one another. Knowing whether someone voted leave or remain is of little use in predicting whether they also want to see strong trade unions or raise the minimum wage. This creates fragmentation within the electorate, which responds differently to different issues. And it naturally puts strain on the major political parties.Crucially, it also means that in an election campaign that is about more than a single issue, the electorate has the capacity to make surprising choices.In this sense, party dynamics in Britain are beginning to look much more “European”, just as we prepare to leave the EU. In contrast to other European nations, the electoral system in the UK has historically served to keep this fragmentation in check. In the uncertain post-referendum environment, that may be changing. But we will only know to what extent when voters go to the polls once more.• Paula Surridge is a senior lecturer at the University of Bristol’s school of sociology, politics and international studies"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3abd95207a3e3a4e06e004f3807050407c6d2663/0_56_5372_3223/master/5372.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83d98830dc71b6cdbfdadea4bc675843","title":"party conferences are all that is wrong with politics","story":"With the party system in collapse, conference season is a depressing spectacle. Couldn’t we just skip it?What happens at a party conference that can’t happen in real life? I often wonder. I’ve been to loads of the damn things, so you might think that, by now, I would have an inkling.In the olden days, I used to think the conferences were for the delegates. They work hard all year on their weird hobby: politics. Why should they not get a few days by the seaside? They deserve a hotel, a fling, a dance on a sticky carpet in the name of making the world a better place . Yet, apart from Brighton (London by the Sea), the seaside towns don’t have what slick party machines need any more. The conference halls are not big enough, the accommodation is too smelly and the food isn’t what many of our MPs have come to expect.So Blackpool was done for years ago, which tells you everything you need to know about how the Westminster-centric world works. It was simply beyond the pale to change trains at Preston, stay somewhere that wasn’t a boutique hotel and dine on lovely carbs.I am no better or worse when it comes to this. I was in Blackpool in 2007 when David Cameron made the “look no notes” speech that propelled him to the Tory leadership, but I spent most of that time in TK Maxx. Sort of hiding. Never quite knowing what to do.Obviously, once you leave the conference centre, most people in whatever city you are in do not know the conference is going on, or what it is for. My reasoning is that I may as well lurk around shopping centres because, at an event where every journalist is looking for “news”, the likelihood of there being any is extremely remote. Now, even more so. Every snitch of gossip is tweeted out: this weekend it was Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, shouting at the Momentum founder Jon Lansman that he was “the hitman that missed”, after his failed attempt to oust Watson.The big story of Jeremy Corbyn’s loss of control over his own party, the war going on between his inner circle and er … everyone else, is utterly depressing. Conference is now squeezing spots in public.If you like, you can blame the media for this, but the fact is that the splits in our main parties are not media inventions. You might have thought that what with all the current proroguery, this peculiar relocation of politicians and hacks would be suspended, but conference is about money, subsidies and funding. Good old face-to-face interaction is necessary in a digital era, but as the party system is in collapse then it has to be said that the three weeks of conference season are not fit for purpose.Now it all exists to be televised and speeches are given in half-empty halls while mediocre offerings from any dear leader are given compulsory ovations. The disconnect between representative democracy as it should be and this facade is on full display at these rallies.If you want to know which way the wind is blowing then look at the stalls and sponsorship and where the money moves to. Look at the cut of the suits. Then wander outside and away.It is really not enough to say, well, the country is deeply ided on Brexit and conference simply reflects those isions. Conference is actually part of that ision and has been for years. I don’t know how anyone can attend these events and think otherwise. The Labour MP Jess Phillips recently described it all as “a massive waste of time … I have no idea why we do it.”Some pretend it is where new thinking can be found. Really? Truth is, it can be fun – after all, who can resist a glass of something, an egg sandwich and a great discussion of how awful everyone else is? Not me.But don’t mistake it for the main story, whatever the media tell you. Conference is all that is wrong with Westminster, simply relocated. It is sometimes said of alcoholics who pretend they are solving their problems by going to live elsewhere that they are “doing a geographical”. Instead, of course, they continue the same behaviour in a different environment.

Taste to see if it needs salt (the clams might have done the job for you).From Trullo by Tim Siadatan (Square Peg, £25)This recipe feels a bit like going to some of the small museums you’ll find around Scandinavia, housing paintings by the old masters. When I eat this I can see the landscape in those paintings, the potatoes from the soil, the apples that grow on the trees, the ducks walking around in the villages, and the dark kitchens that smell of cabbage. It is a little bit like time travel.For the brown cabbage (brunkål)white cabbage 1.5kg butter 75gcaster sugar 50g black peppercorns 1 tsp allspice 2 tsp caraway seeds 2 tsp bay leaves 2 thyme sprigs 10 sea salt and freshly ground black pepperlemon juice to tasteGrind the spices to a coarse mixture using a pestle and mortar. Mix in the salt, rub the mixture into the duck legs and refrigerate for 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 200Cgas mark 6. Place the duck legs in a roasting tin and roast for 1 hour, now and then basting the duck legs with the fat rendering into the tin as they cook.For the brown cabbage, cut the cabbage into medium-thin slices. Melt the butter and cook until light brown, then add the sugar and let it melt into a light brown caramel. Stir well, then add the cabbage, spices and herbs and stir well. Reduce the heat to low, cover and let it simmer for about 2 hours. Take off the heat season to taste with salt, pepper and lemon juice.Meanwhile, cut the potatoes and apples into wedges. When the duck legs have roasted for an hour, add the potatoes to the tin and roast for another 45 minutes, then add the apples, mix well with the juices in the roasting tin and roast for another 15 minutes. Check that the duck meat is tender and, if not, continue to cook a little longer. Serve with the brown cabbage.From Scandinavian Comfort Food: Embracing the Art of Hygge by Trine Hahnemann (Quadrille, £26)I like a coarse-cut, spicy sausage to cook with haricot beans. The pork, fennel seeds and black-pepper-seasoned sausages that hang in Italian grocers, displayed in plump clusters tied together with string, to be exact. Of course, any good sausages will fit the bill, as long as they are so generously filled they look like their skins are about to burst.The recipe can be upscaled easily to cater for large numbers, but add the harissa paste to taste rather than simply multiplying the amount.Serves 2-3olive oil 2 tbspsausages 6 large onion 1rosemary 5 sprigsharissa paste 2 tsptomatoes 4 medium haricot or cannellini beans 2 x 400g canschicken stock 200mlUsing a little of the olive oil, brown the sausages in a shallow, ovenproof pan over a low to moderate heat, turning them regularly so they brown as evenly as possible. Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6.Peel the onion and roughly chop it. Remove the sausages and set them aside, then add the remaining olive oil to the pan and then the chopped onion, letting it soften and colour lightly. It should be the palest gold. Remove the leaves from 2 of the sprigs of rosemary, finely chop them, then add them to the softened onion with a pinch of salt.Stir the harissa paste into the onion. Roughly chop the tomatoes. Add the chopped tomatoes to the onion and rosemary and cook for a few minutes until the tomatoes have started to soften. Drain the beans, rinse them under running water, stir them into the onion, then pour in the stock and bring to the boil. Lower the heat, then return the sausages to the pan. Check the seasoning then bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes.Nigel Slater is the Observer’s cookery writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64772c13953cc6ac620823e7f7f8a291c2499078/0_190_3375_2025/master/3375.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f3e85d53365c1426c9ef498888c0233","title":"barcelona recurring nightmare liverpool la liga granada real madrid","story":"Pretty much the first thing Junior Firpo did as a Barça player was miss the ball. The second was to fall flat on his face. He had been on the pitch for 54 seconds and as he lay on the grass, the soundtrack provided by a bloke with a swanee whistle and a set of cymbals, he watched the men in red and white run beyond him and a familiar scene unfold. It was happening again, only faster. At Athletic Bilbao on the opening night, Barcelona had gone behind in the 89th minute against Betis a week later, it was the 17th and at Osasuna, the sixth.This time, in week five at Granada, they had only just made it to the second when Ramon Azeez scored. This time, they wouldn’t make it out of trouble. As for Junior, signed from Real Betis for €18m in the summer, he didn’t make it out for the second half. Lionel Messi did, at last making his first league appearance of the season, and so did Ansu Fati, their hope at 16. Even they couldn’t salvage anything from this wreckage. Arturo Vidal came on too. Pretty much the first thing he did was boot the ball off. The second was stick a hand out in the area. From the penalty spot, Álvaro Vadillo made it 2-0. It was all over. And, it was tempting to conclude, even this early, all might actually mean all. Barcelona had been beaten. Barcelona are beaten, it seems.On the night when Granada, with a budget that couldn’t pay Messi let alone everyone else at the Camp Nou, their salary cap 18 times lower than Barcelona’s, deservedly won 2-0, the story should have been about them. What they had done was, in their manager’s too-literally-translated words, “barbaric”. It should have been about how 11 of their players on Saturday were in the second ision while Barcelona won the league last season. About how they have lost just once, against Sevilla on their first home game back in primera, and won three in a row since without conceding. It should have been about how victory momentarily took them top. Granada. Top. But it wasn’t. And not just because Diego Martínez, their manager, insisted that looking at the league was a “waste of time”. Or even because the story almost never is about them when it can be about them.It was because there was something about the way Barcelona were defeated, the way it managed to shock and not shock at all, that ran deeper. This wasn’t just one game, and certainly wasn’t just two men – still less Junior or Vidal, or even just Ernesto Valverde – however bad it had been. And, boy, had it been bad. It was difficult to remember a performance worse than this, and yet there was no lack of contenders.This was sudden it was also a long time coming. Dreadful in defence, in midfield, up front. Nothing worked. “Not even with Messi,” ran the cover of AS, and there was something telling in that too. On Friday morning, El Mundo Deportivo gleefully splashed on Real Madrid in crisis. By the following night, it was Barcelona who were. And by the night after, Madrid were top.“This Barcelona lies in ruins,” AS’s headline ran. “Another disaster,” El Mundo Deportivo said. At the end, Frenkie De Jong approached the fans and apologised. He must have wondered where he had ended up. It wasn’t supposed to be this way. “For Barcelona, every stadium is Anfield now,” wrote Santi Giménez. “They are a drama of epic proportions, where anyone can strip them bare with startling ease.” Something broke that night. Or maybe it’s more accurate to suggest that something was revealed, and has not been remedied.They carried on regardless, reluctant to challenge the old order. But once it had happened it was more likely to happen again, a recurring nightmare. Rome resurfaced in Liverpool, and Liverpool resurfaces anywhere: Bilbao, Pamplona, Granada, Dortmund. The Camp Nou is one thing but Barcelona haven’t won away since April. “I am responsible,” Valverde said. He meant for Saturday night but there’s more. It is early, but it is their worst start in 25 years, and for all the coincidences – injuries, penalties, daft inidual mistakes – it isn’t entirely coincidental. They’ve trailed in four of their five games and conceded in all of them. No one in La Liga has conceded more goals.And this is more than that old, facile line about how Barcelona can’t defend: they can’t attack either. At Granada, they had one shot on target. Sure, they have been without Messi, Suárez, Dembélé, Neymar too, but it’s not about that either it’s about the most basic thing of all, the essence of Barcelona, perhaps hidden behind Messi for too long: the play. Against Liverpool, there was something deeper than defeat. That this is a team losing its religion is an old debate, politicised and exaggerated: Barcelona have been the best team in Spain by miles over the last two years. For all the flaws, Anfield remains hard to explain. Nor were they as heretical, as un-Barça as some accusations had it. But there is something in it, in the lack of a structure, an idea, a commitment to an identity.It has been hard to avoid the feeling that too few of those that mattered, manager included, believed in the model. Slowly, football slipped from them. Xavi and Iniesta have gone. Messi is too often the team – a process in which he may not be entirely blameless – and one day, he will be gone too. That has created a kind of desperation. After the defeat in Liverpool, Valverde’s time appeared to have come to a close, but it didn’t. It is hard to see how you can recover from a moment like that. There’s a feeling this is a season too far – two seasons too far, some critics insist. There are parallels to Guardiola’s fourth season and Luis Enrique’s third. Defeat brought opportunity, a chance to reset.But they carried on Josep Maria Bartomeu, the president, backed Valverde and some players did too: they were comfortable. Too comfortable. Valverde stands accused of allowing it. The decline went largely unchallenged. It is not that Barcelona are bad so much as that they’re nothing in particular. De Jong came, someone to reinforce the model, but not always in his place: he has played too wide or not at all. The men alongside him have changed. There have been five different lineups in six weeks.Antoine Griezmann arrived, a year late. He has two positions: one is Messi’s, the other is Suárez’s. The welcome was cold those two wanted Neymar instead. Barcelona pursued the Brazilian publicly, driven by the president. They didn’t sign him, but he cost them. The players who wanted him weren’t happy, Messi among them, and the players that didn’t weren’t either. Asked how sick of it he was on a scale of one to 10, Valverde said 9.5.Barcelona offered PSG players in part-exchange, but didn’t tell the players that. One was Ousmane Dembélé, another was Philippe Coutinho before he was loaned to Bayern Munich. The attempt to sell the players they bought to replace Neymar, at a cost greater than his, to buy the Brazilian back again was the perfect portrait of the whole sorry story.The sporting directors have rotated as much as the players, the latest happily heading off to Paris to chase a player he couldn’t get. Meanwhile, the players flew east then west, preseason trumping the actual season. Then they came back and lost in Bilbao, which turned out to be just the start. Firpo fell down within a minute on his debut. The rest of them had been falling for far longer. “We have a long, hard season ahead of us,” Luis Suárez said on Saturday night, and he meant it.• Zinedine Zidane did something even he hadn’t done before: he took Real Madrid to the Sánchez Pizjuán and won. The last time they won 1-0 there, he was playing. It wasn’t sparkling, but it didn’t have to be they just needed the victory and Zidane, under pressure, needed it most of all. “A lot’s been said,” the Frenchman noted. Now it was his turn and he kept returning to the same word: solidaridad. Whether it will work elsewhere is a different matter. As Jorge Valdano put it on Sunday night: “What Madrid did today they can’t keep doing: Hazard, Bale and James will have to go forward, not defend at the back.”• “Agua, agua.” Kieran Trippier needed a drink, so someone in the south end threw him a bottle. He took a swig and threw it back. A thumbs up and there was applause. Atlético’s fans have really taken to him. Trippier has provided more deliveries into the box than anyone else in the Atlético side, but this time it was not enough: they couldn’t find a way past Celta.• “Peter Lim, go home” read the banner at Mestalla, where a 1-1 draw was played out to protests against the owner. At one point, fans chanted the name of sacked manager Marcelino. Rodrigo wagged his finger he loved Marcelino more than anyone, but now was the time to get behind the new coach, he explained afterwards. When the supporters chanted his name instead, he applauded.• Athletic are top for the first time since the opening day of 2005-06. Unbeaten, only one goal conceded in five, they’re now unbeaten in 17 at home and this is their best start in 25 years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa742f2f3b7e8af3d8c9d78548c6fabdb15a373f/0_187_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d965e5119525d7dfd2bb99d91fbb2293","title":"megan rapinoe the worlds best player in every sense of the word","story":"The World Cup champion has been transcendent, on and off the field. Fifa had no other option but to name her the best women’s player on the planetBy the time Megan Rapinoe stood in Stade de Lyon after July’s World Cup final, arms outstretched like a statue one might find at the Musée d’Orsay, it was obvious she had arrived at an apex few of us can ever hope to reach. The heart of a World Cup-winning USA team that will go down as the greatest ever, Rapinoe was the worthy recipient of Fifa’s The Best award on Monday in the women’s player category.But a few years ago, it was almost inconceivable that Rapinoe would be standing under the bright lights, hailed as a hero. It appeared Rapinoe’s career was winding down and her best days were behind her – struggles that, in retrospect, propelled her to the stage at Fifa’s awards gala.There was the disappointment of the 2016 Olympics, of course, where Rapinoe’s US team were knocked out in the quarter-finals – the earliest exit for the Americans in any major tournament. Rapinoe made her return during the Rio Games after 252 days without playing competitive football and, in her rushed return from an ACL injury, she failed to make the impact coach Jill Ellis had hoped for. There were also the off-field ersions. Rapinoe joined Colin Kaepernick’s protest against racial injustice by kneeling during the national anthem for both club and US team games. In response, the US Soccer Federation passed a new bylaw stating that any player who didn’t stand for the anthem would face punishment, something that threatened her place on the team.All the while, Ellis vowed to upend her roster before the 2019 World Cup and veteran players soon found themselves out in the cold. Call-ups and starts that used to belong to Rapinoe had gone to young up-and-comers such has Mallory Pugh, a winger 13 years Rapinoe’s junior.It was a year that Rapinoe later admitted was a difficult one but she insisted it also rejuvenated her. On the pitch, she was resurgent, fitter and stronger than ever. Away from the game, she became more committed to speaking out, even if it meant being labeled as a “controversial” athlete.Her comeback from one of the most tumultuous years in her career laid the groundwork for her eventual breakout in 2019. At this summer’s World Cup, Donald Trump tweeted criticism of Rapinoe, chastising her for not respecting “our Country … or our Flag” after she had said she did not want to visit the White House. Rapinoe promptly scored twice in her next game, a marquee match-up between the US and France. For good measure, Rapinoe scored again in the World Cup final, which the US won, and left with a literal armful of trophies. Criticize her at your peril.Rapinoe, to be sure, is a dazzling player to watch. A crafty and audacious winger, her enthusiasm is spellbinding – she plays like she’s having the time of her life, even when it seems like everyone wants to bring her down. She’ll dribble a defender into circles, find a seam for a pass out of nowhere, or score an impossible curler and make it look routine. But her sensational 2019 was buoyed by something more than that – something beyond what she could do with the ball at her feet. Her authenticity and self-belief set her apart in the most rigorous edition of the Women’s World Cup ever played.She used routine press conferences to talk about the inequities in women’s football and, even as a Fifa media officer sat close by, she didn’t hold back in her criticism of football’s governing body. Fifa hadn’t shown it cared about the women’s game and offered lip service but not enough resources, she calmly argued.Rapinoe and her teammates have sued the US Soccer Federation over allegations of gender discrimination, and she didn’t demur as the topic came up in France. By the time she and her teammates lifted the World Cup trophy, the crowd in Lyon erupted into a rousing chant: “Equal pay! Equal pay!” If the USA’s biggest star in the tournament had been someone else – someone less inclined to speak so openly about inequality – it’s worth wondering if that chant would have happened.It was only fitting that on the night she was being honored as Fifa’s top player of the year, she again made the platform bigger than herself, calling on everyone to combat racism, sexism and other ugly elements of football.“I ask everyone here: lend your platform to other people,” she told the crowd in Milan. “Lift other people up. Share your success. We have a unique opportunity in football, different to any other sport in the world, to use this beautiful game to actually change the world for better. That’s my charge to everyone. I hope you take that to heart and just do something. Do anything.”How to define the word “best” may vary depending who you ask, and it becomes all the more complicated when trying to untangle a player’s inidual success in a team sport. But if “best” can be defined as the player who made the greatest impact with the most poise at the highest level, there is little doubt that Rapinoe was the best 2019 had to offer.Her performance has been transcendent, not just within the white lines on the grass, but at podiums and in front of crowds. Awarding the top inidual honor to any other player simply wasn’t an option."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbe499c2bcf616df929c57e790a6398e80723f44/0_424_3055_1833/master/3055.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a19f89270f06a4339d38d1c3cc9104c3","title":"eu nations lead condemnation of saudi human rights record","story":"Statement read out at UN human rights council meeting denounces alleged use of torture and unlawful detentionsSaudi Arabia’s human rights record has been heavily censured by two dozen largely western countries who took aim at its worsening record for alleged use of torture, unlawful detentions and unfair trials of critics, including female activists and journalists.The joint statement, which was read out at a meeting of the UN’s Human Rights Council in Geneva, represents the second time in six months that the body has criticised the kingdom, following a similar statement in March.Members urged Saudi authorities to establish the truth about the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Istanbul consulate last October, and ensure that the perpetrators are held to account.Leading the criticism were 15 European Union members, including Britain and Germany, who were among the signatories, as well as Canada, New Zealand and Peru.There was no immediate response by the Saudi delegation, which is among the council’s 47 member states but whose seat was empty. The Saudi ambassador left the room about an hour before to host his country’s national day reception.The kingdom has regularly denied allegations of torture and unfair detention.Among those who addressed the Human Rights Council meeting was Lina al-Hathloul, whose sister – the Saudi women’s activist Loujain al-Hathloul – was arrested last year and allegedly tortured, and whose release she called for.Loujain al-Hathloul was among about a dozen prominent activists who were arrested in May 2018 in the weeks before a ban on women driving cars in the conservative kingdom was lifted, apparently as a sop to hardline conservative elements in the kingdom, who opposed the lifting of the driving ban.In an address to the council, al-Hathloul raised the detention of her sister and other female activists.“Loujain was imprisoned for promoting the implementation of the Vienna declaration of human rights which affirms the full and equal enjoyment by women of all human rights.“Loujain did not get to drive in her home town of Riyadh because she was arrested right before the Saudi government lifted the driving ban for women.”Human rights organisations have, however, documented widespread use of torture in extracting confessions, including from iniduals subsequently executed for participating in protests when they were minors.The focus on Saudi Arabia’s human rights record has intensified since the murder of Khashoggi, which has been widely blamed on the country’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Agnes Callamard, the UN expert on extrajudicial executions worldwide, said in a report last June that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and other senior officials should be investigated over Khashoggi’s murder given what she called credible evidence against them.Although the joint statement acknowledged Saudi reforms, including the announcement last month that restrictions on the rights of women to travel will be lifted, it said deep concerns remained.“However, we remain deeply concerned at the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia. Civil society actors in Saudi Arabia still face persecution and intimidation,” Australia’s ambassador Sally Mansfield said, reading out the statement.“We are concerned at reports of torture, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, unfair trials and harassment of iniduals engaged in promoting and defending human rights, their families and colleagues,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aed77049b51f0e4a04706e53229a46a0d206fa86/1099_886_3711_2227/master/3711.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efda32e0bb2bb90fde2db678ff66f502","title":"neil rankin if you keep your food and drink simple the night is more sociable","story":"Chef, restaurateur and doyen of all things grilled, Neil Rankin explains why it’s all about quality not quantity when it comes to putting together beautiful small plates and cocktailsby Neil Rankin and  Josh LeeAny social occasion needs three things: abundant food, great conversation and even better drinks. It sounds simple, but when you want to impress, the temptation to overcomplicate food can leave you feeling overwhelmed and overworked. So how do you make food to remember, without breaking your back in the kitchen? The answer is to take inspiration from the French – not their haute cuisine, but their countryside cooking, which is just as tasty and a fraction of the effort. The secret is simply to use the best quality ingredients, which should be left to do the culinary talking for you. When the basics are really good, there’s not much more you need to do other than throwing them together.Chicken is a great example. If you buy a standard supermarket chicken, you have to cover it in herbs and spices or even marinate it overnight to get a decent flavour out of it. Get yourself a poulet de bresse, and it’s a whole different story. These birds have been bred in the same French province for centuries, they have loads of space to run around, and they’re encouraged to eat a varied diet. Because of all that, you can put it straight in the oven on a low heat for an hour, then take it out, cover it in salt, and put it back in on high for 15 minutes, and you’ve got a meal for four that tastes out of this world.If you’ve got really nice bull’s heart tomatoes, cucumber and some olive oil, it’s pretty easy to just mix it up into a great salad to go with it crap vegetables make crap salads, and then you need to make it more complicated to make it taste better, which is a false economy. French culinary sensibilities make solo dining low effort too. I remember sitting out one night in Portugal with a tin of Ortiz tuna and crusty bread, and I just spent the whole evening on my balcony eating that with some drinks. It was perfect – no mayonnaise necessary.Speaking of drinks, when it comes to cocktails the same rules apply. If you’ve got good quality Grey Goose Vodka, you don’t need to mask the taste with syrupy mixers. Rather, you should let the inherent quality of Grey Goose Vodka do the talking, using it as the perfect base for botanical and classic citrus flavours such as elderflower, lemon juice or lime juice, as they complement the vodka without overpowering it – both Le Grand Fizz and Paris to Pampelonne are cocktails that add something new to the vodka without distracting from its taste. Grey Goose cocktails are wonderfully versatile too. If you’re pairing with something sweet, an Espresso Martini with high-quality espresso will balance things out nicely.Going straight to suppliers gives your food a story as well, which makes for great dinner party conversation. Customers love it when we wax lyrical about where our produce comes from in my restaurants, and so will your dinner party guests. Around six years ago, I was Instagramming some fishermen in their boat, and they were telling me what fish they’d caught that morning, and the next day it was in my restaurant. People love to hear these sorts of anecdotes because they help them feel connected to the food, which is why “I got it from the supermarket” never quite cuts it when you’re entertaining at home. While you will probably have picked your vodka from the supermarket, with a brand like Grey Goose there’s still a story to tell. Grey Goose is made with only two ingredients: single-origin Picardie winter wheat and water from its natural limestone well – a true reflection of Grey Goose’s French sensibilities.Check out some more cocktail recipes at greygoose"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd32eb2b3b16569e035616d0ea89a510963c9809/0_284_5747_3448/master/5747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04a19e00ba1d62bf60344cdeab06b57f","title":"send us your questions for john humphrys","story":"The Today presenter has asked his final question.

The road not taken. But these regrets are typically rooted in explicit choices and decisions we’ve made. Often, however, we regret things that we weren’t even aware were options – the roads we didn’t know about. This kind of regret is particularly pertinent when it comes to managing our money. Although we make dozens of choices with our money every single day, we are blind to the options we didn’t even consider.For instance, even if we’re prudent enough to put some money aside instead of spending it on items we hardly ever use, we typically just stick it into a savings account. Or we put it into bricks and mortar. Many of us don’t even consider investing.Perhaps this is one reason why people who have successfully met some of their financial goals often credit the advice and wisdom of those with more experience. So what advice would people who’ve been there and done that give to their younger selves – and others?Debby Clarke, 54 bookkeeper, HarpendenMy advice would be to make an effort. I had no financial education whatsoever and I really wish I had. When I was growing up my dad handled the finances and my mum had nothing to do with them, so that set a sort of example. It didn’t help that when I met my future husband he was more clued up and I found it all a bit boring.Many kids still leave school without a clue now. As parents we took it on ourselves to explain things like budgeting, interest and credit to our daughter and that had the effect of making me make more of an effort.The other thing I’d tell myself is to start a pension sooner. I was in my late 30s when I took one out, but then we put all our money into getting on the property ladder, which I don’t regret. But I realise I should have invested a bit more for later in life now that I’m headed in that direction. I won’t be able to afford to retire early like my parents did, probably not at 65 either – but perhaps that’s not the worst thing.Trevor Levy, 55, financial adviser, LondonPensions seem a million miles away in your 20s and I was no different – even though I ended up working in the financial services industry. I was trying to get people to take out a pension but I didn’t have one of my own for a while. Now, I explain to people that pensions aren’t an older person’s thing. A pension is your long-term financial friend and I should have made friends sooner. People get obsessed by property but it’s about having a balanced set of options to cover all eventualities.Making money was seen as cool in the 1980s. Everyone was buying and trading shares. I didn’t know enough about it but I invested in a funeral firm. I thought: “There’s something that’s never going to run out of business” – but there was no plan and I didn’t hold them for very long. Everyone expected to make a quick buck in that era, but it doesn’t work like that. You need to take a long-term view and have a portfolio to spread the risk.Richard Southgate, 70, retired, MaestegOne piece of advice my dad gave me was: “Spend a bit, save a bit, make the devils wait a bit.” I didn’t quite heed my parents’ advice. There’s probably something in that. They knew stuff I didn’t. They were upper-working class and had to be careful with money.If I could do things again I’d have got on the housing ladder quicker. For my generation property has proved great value. Though obviously it’s much harder to get on the ladder these days.There was a tech boom a few years ago. I didn’t have a lot of money but I wanted to get in on it. I had a financial adviser and he said: “It’s too late, don’t bother.” I didn’t listen and lost a fair bit – so that was a salutary lesson. I have taken advice since and have done OK on the stock market. I learned to ride the ups and downs and take a long-term view.

That Burns is far removed from the country music industry, having no real professional or personal ties to the music or its larger infrastructure, ends up being representative of what’s most notable about the documentary as a whole. Historically, country music has viewed perceived outsiders with, at best, skepticism and, in its ugliest moments, with overt hostility. As an outsider himself, Burns approaches the genre from a perspective that gives thoughtful consideration to the experiences of artists whose contributions have been marginalized. Burns’s exploration of the genre concludes in 1996, but the greatest value of his series is in reframing conversations that have dominated discussions of country music in 2019.Arguments about the status of country music are in no way a recent phenomenon. For decades, notions of “authenticity” or genre purity have butted against the view that even the most traditional forms of music must evolve to remain artistically vital and commercially viable. Throughout 2019, that tension has frequently manifested in efforts at gatekeeping, and those discussions have centered primarily around Lil Nas X’s Old Town Road. The year’s biggest single has been the subject of controversy first for the way that Lil Nas X cleverly entered the single’s metadata so that it would appear as a country track across digital platforms, and then for decisions to include and then exclude it from Billboard’s country charts. While there’s been some hemming and hawing about chart methodology, the arguments have reduced to whether Old Town Road belongs in country music.What Country Music illustrates, then, is that singles like Old Town Road are hardly anomalies in the history of country music. Beyond considerations of what’s been dubbed the “Yeehaw Agenda” or of how often artists have actually attempted to set a cheating song with references to Wrangler jeans over a trap beat the way that Lil Nas X has done, Burns provides frequent and meaningful examples of how liberally country artists have incorporated disparate styles into their music and have done so from the genre’s very inception. The first episode alone includes profiles of both Jimmie Rodgers, whose signature yodel became an early hallmark of country music and who eagerly performed that yodel on most any type of record that might sell to a wide audience, and DeFord Bailey, an African American multi-instrumentalist who performed alongside Bill Monroe and Roy Acuff and whose career was often hamstrung by racist institutions.Country Music posits that the genre has always been more erse than its stereotype would suggest while also accounting for the reasons why that ersity is seldom recognized to the extent that it should be. What’s different in 2019 are the intensity and focus of demands for country music to hold itself accountable for its problematic history of gatekeeping, which has too often excluded marginalized groups. At the moment, that’s a matter of asking whether a gay, African American rapper who gained popularity on TikTok before enlisting Billy Ray Cyrus to sing the hook on a remix of his viral hit truly has a place in contemporary country music. Throughout the year, that conversation has extended further to include Blanco Brown, whose single The Git Up, which lands halfway between a hoedown and the Cha Cha Slide, has gained traction across radio formats. Even more recently, country has struggled to know how to respond to The Highwomen, a quartet formed by women whose solo careers range from Maren Morris’s slick commercial country to Amanda Shires’ Americana. The group’s unabashed feminism is at odds with industry practices that have deliberately removed women’s voices from country radio.Burns has drawn criticism both for not leaning hard enough into matters of institutional racism and sexism and for overstating those types of prejudices as the behest of a political agenda. Ultimately, that’s a matter of the scale of his project. Sixteen hours makes for a lengthy documentary series, but it simply isn’t sufficient to provide more than a survey course in one of American culture’s most enduring and substantive art forms. Burns is purposeful with regard to representation, but the examples he provides are not exhaustive when it comes to the contributions of socially marginalized artists. And certainly the intersections of race, sex and class within the country music industry are ripe for deep explorations that re-center unbalanced power dynamics. Indeed, that might make for a more challenging documentary than Country Music. Burns’s macro-level view, though, is still instructive in the sense that a single like Old Town Road might not be viewed as a lightning rod today had country music truly reckoned with and accounted for its biases, having had many opportunities to do so before 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cce82c273cbe1cb3784d399e494b29065d3d14f0/322_873_3857_2313/master/3857.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3923e60ef2f9084c619f2af76819a4c6","title":"ursula herrmann germany kidnapping mystery","story":"On 15 September 1981, 10-year-old Ursula Herrmann headed home by bike from her cousin’s house. She never arrived. So began one of Germany’s most notorious postwar criminal cases, which remains contentious to this dayIn the Alpine foothills in the far south of Germany is a vast lake called the Ammersee. Its shores are dotted with centuries-old villages where wealthy families from Munich buy large second homes and tourists drink beer at waterfront restaurants. At the north end of the lake is a pair of such villages, Eching am Ammersee and Schondorf, less than two miles apart. Separating them is a block of spruce forest that attracts hunters, joggers, mountain bikers and in the late summer 38 years ago, kidnappers preparing to commit what would become one of the country’s most notorious postwar crimes.After class on Tuesday 15 September 1981, the first day of the new school year, a 10-year-old girl named Ursula Herrmann returned to her house in Eching. Ursula, the youngest of four siblings, practised piano with her oldest brother Michael, and then headed off to her late afternoon gymnastics lesson in Schondorf, cycling through the forest along the lakeside path. When the gym class was over, she went to her cousin’s house in Schondorf, where she ate dinner. At 7.20pm, Ursula’s mother phoned the aunt to say her daughter needed to come home. The shadows were lengthening but it was still light, and the cycle ride would only take 10 minutes.Half an hour later, she was still not home. Her mother again called the aunt, who said Ursula had left 25 minutes before. Both of them immediately knew something was wrong. Ursula’s father rushed into the forest from Eching, and her uncle did the same from Schondorf. They met in the middle, along the path. Ursula’s name rang out through the darkening wood. But there was no reply.Within an hour neighbours, police and firemen had joined the search, torch beams raking the water and struggling to penetrate the thick undergrowth. With midnight approaching, and rain falling, a sniffer dog led its handler away from the lake, into the brush. There, 20 metres from the path, was Ursula’s little red bike. But she was nowhere to be seen.At first light the search intensified. Dozens of officers wearing raincoats and rubber boots spread out through the dense forest, on the border of which stands Landheim Schondorf, an expensive private school founded in 1905 and favoured by Bavaria’s political and business elite. As a helicopter hovered overhead, a police boat and ers scanned the shallows of the lake. Local radio carried the shocking news of the missing girl in an idyllic part of the country: 1.43m (4ft 7in) tall with short blonde hair, wearing dark green cords, a grey woollen cardigan and red-brown sandals the daughter of a teacher and a housewife.On the Thursday morning, when Ursula had been missing for more than 36 hours, the phone rang in the Herrmann house. When Ursula’s parents picked up there was silence, and then a short, familiar jingle, which they recognised from the traffic bulletin on the Bayern 3 radio station. More silence ensued, and then the jingle played again before the caller hung up. Three more similar calls – baffling and sinister – followed over a period of hours. A team from the local police department, now stationed inside the Herrmann home, began recording the calls.When the phone rang that afternoon, and the jingle sounded, Ursula’s mother agreed to pay the ransom. She also asked for proof of life: what were her daughter’s nicknames for her two stuffed toys? When the kidnappers did not reply, she became frantic. “Talk to me, say something, something from Ursula!”That same evening, the kidnappers posted a second letter, which arrived on Monday 21 September, with curiously specific instructions regarding the ransom. The kidnappers wanted the money to be paid in used 100-deutschmark bills, packed in a suitcase. It was to be delivered to an as yet unnamed location by Ursula’s father, who was to drive alone in a yellow Fiat 600 going no faster than 90kmh.Unlike some other residents of Eching, and the parents of the pupils at the boarding school in Schondorf, the Herrmanns were not wealthy. They had only been able to build a home near the lake because Ursula’s great-grandfather had purchased some grazing land there decades earlier. A neighbour raised part of the ransom, and the state agreed to cover the rest.The Herrmanns waited desperately for more instructions. But there were no more letters and no more calls. Nor did the police have any strong leads. Two weeks passed. The police decided to search the forest again. More than a hundred officers were assembled, with 10 sniffer dogs. The wood was ided into four parts, and each quarter into small grids. The teams began searching every grid, one by one, using metal rods to probe the ground.By the fourth day of searching, a gloomy Sunday, they had covered most of the forest. Ursula had been missing for 19 days. At 9.30am, there was a loud shout. In a tiny glade about 800m away from the lake path, one of the officers had struck something solid when probing the soil. Another policeman rushed over and, after wiping away the leaves and scraping through a layer of clay, discovered a brown blanket covering a wooden board. He removed it only to find second board, which appeared to be the lid of a box. It was 72cm by 60cm – the size of a small coffee table – painted green and locked from the top with seven sliding bolts. Using a spade, he forced the lid open, and peered in. There was Ursula. Her body was cold, lifeless. The officer wept when lifting her out.Two detectives were sent to break the news to Ursula’s parents at their home, a short walk away. While her mother was too distraught to ask any questions, her father asked repeatedly: had his daughter been hurt before her death? The truthful answer was no. An autopsy concluded that Ursula died within 30 minutes to five hours of being buried. Since there was no sign of struggle, or even movement, inside the box, the doctors assumed she had been drugged beforehand, possibly with nitrous oxide.It appeared that the kidnappers had planned to keep Ursula alive. The box, 1.40m deep by 1m wide, was fitted with a shelf and a seat that doubled as a toilet. It was stocked with three bottles of water, 12 cans of Fanta, six large chocolate bars, four packets of biscuits and two packs of chewing gum. It also contained a small, bizarre library of 21 books, from Donald Duck comics to westerns, romance novels and thrillers with titles such as The Horror Lurks Everywhere. There was a light and a portable radio tuned to Bayern 3, the same station that broadcast the traffic jingle. To enable Ursula to breathe, the box had a ventilation system made from plastic plumbing pipes, which extended to ground level. But whoever designed it had failed to realise that without a machine to circulate the air, the oxygen would quickly run out.The police believed they were hunting more than one kidnapper, because of the size and weight of the box. At 60kg, it would probably have needed at least two people to carry it into the woods. The perpetrators must have known the forest well, for they had chosen a remote site within it, and had avoided attention while digging the hole and hacking paths through the dense brush.In Eching and nearby villages, parents who previously let their children roam free were now terrified to let them out of sight. The shock was amplified by the frenzied press coverage. On the day of the funeral, after much harassment from journalists, Ursula’s brother Michael, a shy 18-year-old, lost his temper with a photographer who held a camera right in front of his face, and knocked the camera to the ground.Desperate to find the culprits, the police offered a DM30,000 reward for information, and tips poured in. One name that came up was Werner Mazurek. He was 31, lived with his wife and their two children just a few hundred metres from the Herrmanns. A trained car mechanic who left school at 15 and now ran his own TV repair business, Mazurek was good with his hands. He was imposing – tall, with a beer-drinker’s stomach – and quick-tempered, and not well liked in Eching. He was also heavily in debt, owing a bank more than DM140,000, so he had a motive.Questioned by police a week after Ursula’s body was found, Mazurek could not initially recall his movements on the night she went missing. It took him 24 hours to provide an alibi: he had been playing the board game Risk with his wife and two friends. But a search of his home and workshop revealed nothing that linked him to the crime. Later that month, the forensics team examining the box found a fingerprint on a piece of duct tape, raising hopes of a breakthrough. Thousands of locals, including Mazurek, were fingerprinted, but no match was discovered.The police still suspected that Mazurek was involved. At the end of January 1982, they arrested him, along with two of his friends, and interrogated them for several days before releasing them. A month later, another of Mazurek’s acquaintances was questioned. Klaus Pfaffinger was an unemployed mechanic with a drinking problem. His landlord, who was owed rent, had told police that in the weeks before the crime he had seen his tenant driving his moped with a spade strapped to the side. Pfaffinger initially protested his innocence. But on the second day of questioning, when the interrogators took a break and he was alone with the police secretary, he said a startling thing: “What if I know something?” When the interrogators returned, Pfaffinger told them that Mazurek had asked him to dig a hole in the forest in early September 1981, promising payment of DM1,000 and a colour television. Pfaffinger said he had dug the hole and had later seen a box embedded inside.Convinced they had cracked the case, the detectives drove Pfaffinger to the forest that separated Eching and Schondorf. They asked him to lead them to the burial site. To their dismay, he was unable to locate it, or even come close. On returning to the police station, he announced: “I am revoking this confession, it’s not true what I said.” During at least 10 subsequent interrogations in the following months, he refused to repeat his confession, and was eventually released without charge.By the summer of 1982, after his name was smeared, Mazurek was preparing to move away from Eching with his family. The lead detective who had pursued him was replaced, and the net cast more widely. Some 100,000 colour posters requesting help with the investigation were distributed nationwide. A television programme, Aktenzeichen XY ... Ungelöst – Case number XY … Unsolved – which would serve as the model for the BBC’s Crimewatch and America’s Most Wanted, featured a long segment on the Ursula Herrmann case. The new police team found more evidence of the kidnappers’ methods, including a wire that they had strung through the trees along the lakeside path to serve as an alert system during the abduction. But investigations of other suspects came to nothing. By the end of the 1980s, the investigation had wound down. Across Germany, most people still remembered the shocking unsolved case of the 10-year-old girl buried alive in the box.Ursula’s parents and siblings, meanwhile, were doing their best to move on with their lives. Though they grieved deeply for Ursula, who they remembered as an intelligent, energetic girl who loved to sing and paint, they did so in private, never speaking to the press. Soon after their youngest child’s death, the parents had made a conscious decision not to let the hunt for the kidnappers consume the family, or the tragedy define their lives. Without any known perpetrators to blame, they tried to think of it as a terrible accident. It was hardest for Ursula’s mother, who believed she should have gone to fetch her daughter from her cousin’s house. Ursula’s father and sister turned to their strong Christian faith to find peace. Her youngest brother eventually found solace in surfing.Michael, the elder brother, who was in his final year of school at the time of the crime, was playing music at a friend’s house on the night Ursula disappeared. When his mother called in a panic, saying his little sister was missing, he rushed home and joined the search for her in the forest. He was devastated when her body was found. “Then it quickly turned into: what can I do with this now?” he told me recently. “Because I knew the ‘why’ could never be answered. I decided: I am alive and I have some tasks to do.”In the mid-2000s, the Bavarian state office for criminal investigations started looking in earnest at its backlog of cold cases. The most famous was the Ursula Herrmann kidnapping, which had by then appeared three times on Case number XY … Unsolved, and was still a stain on the reputation of the local police and judiciary. Prosecutors hoped that the development of DNA profiling over the previous two decades might help crack the case. The mass of evidence from the original investigation, including the ransom notes and the box, was painstakingly re-examined. Numerous hairs were found, from which the forensic experts were able to build the DNA profiles of several different people. Now they just needed a match. In 2007 they got one.A genetic sample recovered from a screw on the box matched that found on a glass in the Munich penthouse of a wealthy woman who was brutally murdered there in May 2006. But the police excitement about a breakthrough was short-lived. On trial for the Munich killing was the victim’s nephew, who was only a few years old when Ursula was kidnapped. After extensive forensic investigations, the judges ruled that no link could be established between the two criminal cases, and the nephew was convicted for the Munich murder. How the match with the sample from the Herrmann case occurred remains a mystery – though very rare, mistakes do occur in genetic profiling.For the prosecutors looking at the Herrmann case, time was running out. Her death had not been deemed a murder, but rather kidnapping with deadly consequences, a crime that carried a 30-year statute of limitations. In five years, the people responsible would be in the clear. The state prosecutors went back to the 1980s case files, to look at the main suspects. Klaus Pfaffinger, the unemployed man who briefly claimed to have dug the hole, was dead. But Werner Mazurek was still alive, and living with his wife in the north of Germany, where he ran a boat accessories businesses and, with a friend on Tuesday evenings, a snack bar that bore the advertising slogan: “Norbert’s pig and Werner’s beer, the finest at the harbour pier”.In 2007, Mazurek was placed under surveillance and an undercover officer deployed to befriend him. Police planted recording devices in his car and his house, and tapped his phone. In October that year, his home was searched and he was asked to provide a saliva sample. It did not match any of the genetic profiles found on the box.The prosecutors had one hope left. Among the items taken from Mazurek’s house during the search was an old reel-to-reel tape recorder. In the calls to Ursula’s parents in the days after her disappearance, the kidnappers had played a jingle. Was it possible that this device was used to record that jingle from the radio all those years ago? A sound expert, who had access to the original recordings of the 1981 calls, spent months conducting tests on the tape recorder, concluding that it was indeed used in the kidnapping.On 28 May 2008, nearly 27 years after Ursula’s death, Mazurek was arrested and flown to Augsburg, a city near Eching. Ursula’s parents, who were still living in the same house by the Ammersee, had been notified a few days before that an arrest was imminent. They were also told they could be part of the trial. Under the German legal system, relatives of the victims of certain serious crimes are allowed to formally join the prosecution as nebenklage, or co-plaintiffs. This gives them the right to view the evidence, request witnesses and put questions to the judges.Ursula’s parents did not want to be confronted again by the horrifying details of their daughter’s death, all these years later. Instead, it was agreed that the co-plaintiff would be their oldest son, Michael, who was by then in his 40s, teaching religion and music at a girls’ secondary school in Augsburg. He was a quiet, family man, but also one who is “not content with half-truths”, as his old friend Michael Hofstetter, who was with him in Eching on the evening Ursula disappeared, recently told the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. “He has such a very deep sense of justice that drives him.”The trial opened in February 2009 before a packed court in Augsburg. Mazurek, characterised in one newspaper as a “bearded giant”, sat in front of his wife, who was also on trial as an accessory to the crime. Reading from a 20-page statement, Mazurek insisted he was innocent. “I know I was certainly not a good citizen, sometimes rude, and we’ll see many attempts to portray me as a bad person. But I have nothing to do with this act.”The prosecution had no difficulty finding evidence of his poor character. Mazurek’s daughter and stepson had few good things to say about him as a father. He had also had other scrapes with the law, including a fraud conviction in 2004 for falsifying documents. Then there was the story about the dog. In 1974, Mazurek returned from the Oktoberfest beer festival to find that the family dog, a mixed-breed named Susi, had overturned the rubbish bin in the kitchen. Mazurek grabbed the dog and locked it in the basement freezer. The next day his wife at the time, who would soon orce him, went to the freezer to get some meat only to discover Susi there, frozen to death. Mazurek later said he had punished the pet “with exile to Siberia”.The prosecution laid out the circumstantial evidence against Mazurek. He had a motive as he needed the money, and the means to secretly build a box, because he owned a workshop. While Ursula was missing he had been observed listening to police radio, and a piece of leather used in the box construction was cut from a belt owned by someone with a large stomach, like Mazurek. And, in 2007, after police searched and bugged his house, they listened in on a phone call between him and an old friend from Eching where they discussed the statute of limitations for the Ursula Herrmann case.But the key elements of the prosecutors’ case were the revoked confession by Pfaffinger – that he dug the hole at Mazurek’s request – and the tape recorder. They insisted the confession was credible. As the old police files showed, Pfaffinger’s confession was accurate in several ways: he had described the burial site in detail, from the size of the forest glade and the dimensions of the hole to the soil conditions. The lead police investigator in 1982 was convinced Pfaffinger deliberately misled him during the forest visit, when he could not locate where the box was buried. Testifying in court, all these years later, the same policeman described Pfaffinger as an “excellent actor and practised swindler”.The tape recorder was the most important, and controversial, piece of evidence. When questioned by police in 2007, Mazurek said he had purchased it only a few weeks earlier, at a flea market while on a short holiday with his wife. But he could not prove who sold it to him, and nobody at the market could recall such a device being on sale that day. The state’s expert, whose speciality was phonetics rather than audio, described how, in the recording of the ransom calls, you could hear a couple of clicking sounds – the buttons of a tape recorder being pressed during the recording of the jingle. When she pressed the buttons on the tape machine, she had, in her words, an “aha” moment. The sounds were identical. Other subtle characteristics of the recording also corresponded precisely to the specific machine in front of her. It was, she said, “probable” that the very same tape recorder found in Mazurek’s house was used in the ransom calls.Summing up, in March 2010, the senior prosecutor reminded the court that Ursula had been “buried alive in a box”, revealing the “cold-bloodedness and mercilessness of the perpetrator”. The three judges and two jurors were convinced, finding Mazurek guilty and sentencing him to life imprisonment. His wife was acquitted, due to lack of evidence. In court, everyone seemed happy that Ursula’s killer had finally been put away. Everyone, that is, except one person.At the start of the trial, few people in court had taken much notice of Michael Herrmann. Despite his distinctive appearance – he wears his grey hair in a ponytail and at the time also sported thin sideburns down to his jaw – he is unassuming, not the kind of man who draws attention to himself. After graduating from high school, he studied teaching in Augsburg, and then opened a music store, selling instruments and equipment, including tape recorders. He got married, had three children and fostered a fourth. He loved watching them grow up, seeing them share his love of music, finding their own way in life.People who knew what happened to Ursula sometimes asked if it made Michael anxious about his own kids, but for some reason it didn’t. Nor did he ever think about looking for the perpetrators himself that was the job of the police. Though he felt at peace in his life, his sister’s death still felt to him like an “unclosed circle”. The trial, and his status as a co-plaintiff, offered an opportunity to close it. While most nebenklage are passive observers in court, Michael decided to take his role far more seriously. He would not allow the family to be victims a second time.Before the trial started, to the surprise of his state-assigned lawyer, Michael had requested full access to the case files, which ran into tens of thousands of scanned pages. In the first few weeks of the trial he got through 6,000 pages, locking himself in the study at home at night, unable to stop reading. His memories of Ursula were strong: he recalled how, despite her liveliness, she was also cautious and at times sensitive, growing upset when some of her schoolmates repeatedly misbehaved. But reading through the typewritten police reports he realised he had forgotten many of the details of the horrifying days in September 1981, even the fact that he had helped Ursula with her piano practice just a few hours before she was kidnapped. It was, he felt, like his brain has somehow blanked out that part of his life. To Michael, there was much to suggest Mazurek might have committed the crime, but there were also things that troubled him about the prosecution case. He could not understand why Pfaffinger’s revoked confession was now being treated as plausible, when it was dismissed all those years before. From the police files it was clear that Pfaffinger had a serious alcohol problem. While in detention he claimed to have experienced hallucinations. He was also chronically work-shy questioned in 2008, his former wife called him a “lazy guy” who would never have agreed to dig a large hole.As the court heard, Pfaffinger’s confession was not even signed the investigator wrote it down from memory weeks later. And, as with Mazurek, there was no DNA proof connecting Pfaffinger to the crime. Before the trial, the police exhumed Pfaffinger’s body but there was no match to the genetic profiles they had discovered among the evidence a few years before.Most concerning to Michael was the tape recorder. With his background in music, he knew a lot about acoustics and sound engineering, and could not understand how a tape recorder could be definitively linked to the ransom calls all those years ago. Even if the reel-to-reel device had been used to record the jingle from the radio, as the prosecution alleged, the kidnappers would still have had to transfer that recording to a second, more portable device, since the calls to the Herrmann house were made from pay phones. The acoustic environments in the booth and at the kidnapper’s home would also have influenced what the police eventually heard and recorded at the other end of the phone line.Michael’s lawyer advised him not to make a big deal out of it. “She said: ‘you don’t do this as a nebenklage’. But I did not think about habits, I just did what I thought was right,” Michael told me. He wrote a letter to the court, calling the sound expert’s report about the tape recorder “incomplete or one-sided”. The judges were not happy, but by law they were obliged to read out the letter in court. It was a highly unusual and sensational intervention – a member of the prosecution team, the victim’s brother, no less, acting in favour of the defence. When the verdict against Mazurek was announced, Michael made a statement at the courthouse. “I am not convinced of his guilt,” he said. “But neither am I convinced of his innocence.” Instead of the circle being closed, it had opened further.Six months after the trial, in late 2010, Michael began to notice a strange, high frequency noise in his left ear. At night the hissing would wake him up and prevent him falling back asleep. Even worse, it often tormented him during the day, especially when was he trying to teach music. He had never experienced tinnitus before, and thought it might relate to the trial. The court-appointed psychologist, on hand to assist relatives of crime victims, examined him and agreed that the stress of the court case was indeed the likely cause.By then, Michael was increasingly sceptical that Mazurek was guilty. After the trial ended, Michael kept returning, night after night, his ear ringing, to the case files, which he had stored on his computer, meticulously arranging the evidence in folders. It had put strain on his marriage – he separated from his wife in 2012 – but he could not let it go. He felt he owed it to his parents, to himself, even to the German public, to pursue the truth. “What drives me is ethics – doing what is morally right,” he told me. “It was just wrong for the case to end like it did.”So he came up with a plan. In 2013, he filed a civil claim, seeking €20,000 in damages from Mazurek for causing his tinnitus. It was a legal ruse: since Mazurek would defend the case on the basis that he was wrongfully convicted and so could not be considered responsible, the court would have to reconsider the facts of the criminal trial before coming to a conclusion. It would be an opportunity, Michael believed, “to get nearer to the truth”.“The judges knew what was going on, and they were pissed off,” Joachim Feller, who has been Michael’s lawyer since 2012, told me when we met at his offices in Landsberg am Lech, an ancient town about 20 minutes drive from Eching. “They tried several times to stop it going forward.” The court insisted that an independent psychiatrist examine Michael, and to rule on whether his tinnitus was caused by the trial. After the psychiatrist confirmed it was, the case finally went ahead in 2016. It dragged on for more than two years.Unlike with the criminal trial, where the media focus was on Mazurek, it was now on Michael. He found himself having to explain to his pupils in his music and religion classes, who knew him as a reserved, kind teacher, why they were seeing his face in the newspapers and on TV. He took journalists to Eching, and into the forest where Ursula was kidnapped. Even so, apart from Herrmann’s close family and friends, few understood why he was pursuing the case. A local journalist who covered the criminal and civil cases told me his newsroom colleagues often asked him why Herrmann “could not just let it go”. “I myself am still trying to work out why Michael Herrmann is acting like this,” the journalist said. “He is quiet and calm, but still he looks into the files … There is a little obsession.”As the civil trial went on, it became clear that he was not the only person with doubts about the original verdict. Appearing for the defence was a retired physicist and amateur sound expert named Bernd Haider, who had built his first tape recorder from scratch in the 1960s and lived in a village just a few miles from Eching. He vividly remembered the coverage of the crime from 1981, though he had never heard of Mazurek before his arrest. Haider had followed the 2009 trial in the media and, like Michael, was highly sceptical about the tape-recorder evidence. Later, he had borrowed a similar machine, got hold of the ransom call recordings, and tried to see if it was possible to replicate the phonetic expert’s findings. After a year of testing, he concluded it was not, and offered his assistance to Mazurek’s lawyer.When I visited Haider this spring, the borrowed tape recorder was still in his loft. After a lunch of wiener schnitzel and potatoes, he told me: “Michael Herrmann was the only person in the original trial who understood what the problem with this evidence was. He said ‘it’s impossible’, but he was sitting on the wrong side of the court!”Towards the end of the civil case, Michael gained another ally. In London, a German academic named Barbara Zipser read an article online about his efforts to get to the truth. Zipser was a child in Germany when Ursula was kidnapped, and recalled the horror she felt then. In terms of its impact, it was the German equivalent of the Madeleine McCann case, Zipser told me when we met this year. “I thought: whoever did this, I want that person in jail,” she said.Since Zipser’s speciality is linguistic profiling – at Royal Holloway, University of London, she uses modern profiling techniques to identify authors of ancient Greek medical texts – she decided to compare the ransom notes sent by the kidnappers to samples of Mazurek’s writing, which Haider had posted on the internet. Zipser analysed the words used, and the writing style. Whoever composed the ransom notes was well educated, she said, a native speaker pretending to be a foreigner by writing in broken German. “I am sure it was not Mazurek,” Zipser told me.In August 2018, the civil case concluded and the court ordered Mazurek to pay Michael €7,000 for causing his tinnitus. It was a victory that to Michael represented a loss, since to arrive at the decision the judges first needed to agree with the criminal court that Mazurek, together with an unidentified accomplice, was indeed the man who had kidnapped Ursula.In an open letter to the Bavarian state and the media, Michael wrote: “My sister’s fate has stayed with me for 37 years, and to this day, it is unclear who was actually responsible for her death. Could it be that the Augsburg legal system is not actually interested in solving the case of Ursula Herrmann, the death of my little sister? … If the court decides to close the proverbial lid, it should be well aware that one cannot shut the truth away.”Since Mazurek was arrested in 2008, he has been represented by Walter Rubach, one of Bavaria’s best-known defence lawyers. Rubach sees things in black and white. If a client asks him whether he believes in their innocence – as Mazurek did in 2008 – he brushes away the question. “I told him I don’t believe any of my clients,” Rubach told me in his chambers in Augsburg. “My job is to work out if there’s enough proof and evidence to convict them.” In Mazurek’s case he was convinced from the start that there wasn’t.“It was clear that Mazurek was a person who could have committed something like that. But there were no hard facts – it was a circumstantial case at its finest,” Rubach said. “I am still upset at how he was convicted. What is it you say in England? Rather let 10 guilty men go free than hang one innocent one.”Though Rubach has had little personal interaction with Michael, he has watched him across the court, and likes and admires him. “What he has done, as a co-plaintiff, going against the decision of a court – this never happened before in Germany.”From his prison cell in Germany’s far north, Mazurek is still trying to clear his name. After I wrote to him this year, he replied saying he had hired a private investigator to track down the man who he says sold him the tape recorder in 2007. “I am just angry and I am awaiting the 11th anniversary of my time in jail,” he wrote.On a mild Sunday morning in April, I met Michael in Augsburg. As he had been most days in court, he was dressed casually, in trainers, blue jeans and a black jacket. Despite his legal setbacks, and the tinnitus that continues to bother him, he comes across as calm and warm, and possesses a dry sense of humour. As we drove through the Bavarian countryside towards Eching, he tried to explain the meaning of überfordert, the word he used to describe the police in 1981: “It means when the task you have is bigger than your capabilities – like Brexit.”Michael knows the case material so well – he has put in far more hours of research than any of the lawyers for the defence or prosecution – that when he speaks, it is with the precision and detachment of a special investigator, rather than a relative. After parking the car beside the road between Eching and Schondorf, he noted it was probably where the kidnappers had parked when bringing the box to the forest. An SUV track led into the woods. “We need to walk 141 metres,” Michael said, and then look 20 metres to the left, to locate the spot where Ursula was buried. “We don’t know if she was sedated and carried or if she was forced to walk there,” he said. “But we know she was taken on paths specially cut through the forest.”Michael’s father died several years ago, and in 2016 his mother moved out of the family home in the village to Augsburg. But his younger brother Hannes – the surfer – still lives in the house, along with two Syrian refugees who rent out the bottom floor. Michael phoned him – he did not want to show up with a journalist, unannounced – and Hannes invited us in for coffee. We never spoke about Ursula. As with his oldest sister and their mother, Hannes has never talked to the media about his sister’s death, though Michael says that in private his family supports his work on the case, as do his children and his new partner. But in public, at least, he is alone in his quest to reopen the case.After lunch at a restaurant beside the lake, where sailboats bobbed in the distance, we walked along the road towards the forest, the route Ursula took on her way to gym class nearly 40 years ago. The spruce trees are much taller than they were then, and the undergrowth less thick, but the path is the same: three metres wide, compact gravel. Cyclists on electric bikes sped by.After a few minutes, as we neared a small jetty leading to a wooden hut used by bathers, Michael stopped on the path. “This is where Ursula was kidnapped,” he said. “It’s where her bike was found and where the bell-wire ended.” The bell-wire is the 140m-long coil of insulated copper wire the kidnappers used as part of a warning system. Though the police had noticed the wire while searching for Ursula, they only learned of its significance more than a year later, when investigators visited the private boarding school in Schondorf to talk to pupils about the case. Two students came forward, saying that seven or eight months after the kidnapping, when chasing an owl through the forest, they had found the bell-wire strung through the trees next to the lakeside path. The boys then did a very strange thing: they took the wire down, measured it on the school athletics track, and then kept it in their dormitory in a locked box, until the police visit.On examining the wire, the investigators realised it must have been used during Ursula’s abduction. While one of the kidnappers waited for the victim, the other presumably served as a lookout further along the path, with their finger on a button that would light up a bulb or sound a buzzer at the other end of the wire.Michael believes the wire is one of the key pieces of evidence that could help identify the real kidnappers. Besides hunters, joggers and cyclists, the boarding school pupils also knew the forest well. Yet it appears that none of them were fingerprinted at the time of the investigation. Another piece of evidence also hints at the possible involvement of younger people in the plot: an impression on the paper of one of the ransom notes revealed a mathematical probability tree, of the sort taught to teenagers. Michael also notes that in a comic found in the box, one of the main characters drives a Fiat 600, the car that was mentioned in the ransom note and which was rare in Germany at the time, suggesting the kidnappers may have read the comic.Late last year, in an effort to have the case reopened, Michael submitted a dossier of all his new evidence and theories to the state prosecutor’s office in Augsburg. In April, when I interviewed Matthias Nickolai, spokesman for the public prosecutor, he acknowledged that many people still had questions about the verdict in the criminal trial, but insisted the judges had arrived at the correct decision in 2010, and that it was “final and absolute”. In August, this became official, when the prosecutor’s office announced it would not be reopening the case.Through his lawyer, Michael told the local press that he would be making no more public statements about the case, nor giving interviews, which the media interpreted as him finally giving up. But when I emailed him recently he said this was not true. “I didn’t say that I am not going to take it any further,” he wrote.On 15 September, a few days after I received that message, it was the 38th anniversary of Ursula’s kidnapping and death. As they have done for the last few years, Michael, along with his two siblings and his mother, travelled to the graveyard in Eching where Ursula is buried. Just the four of them, no partners. There they remembered the little girl who left her cousin’s house on her red bike on a summer’s evening and never came home. •"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/576c48c7a2df97278856f95f9ad93d420b20f9d4/0_148_4170_2502/master/4170.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f46a732f1e266de7cfc9ffbe9bedfc00","title":"where did it all go wrong for david cameron","story":"As the former PM publishes his memoirs, Patrick Wintour tells Anushka Asthana that Cameron’s pursuit of austerity and decision to call an EU referendum sowed the seeds of his demise.

These are the choices before you.”His approach, as set out in a statement from the national executive committee (NEC), was agreed on the conference floor with a show of hands as “composite 13”, calling for a remain stance, was defeated.A string of speakers throughout the debate at Labour’s annual conference in Brighton urged their colleagues to fall in behind Corbyn’s stance.With just months, or perhaps even weeks to go before a general election, there were fears that a show of disunity would harm the Labour leadership.When the remain motion fell after a show of hands, many stood and cheered, and broke into a chorus of “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn”.The chair, Wendy Nichols, initially appeared to say the motion had been carried but then said it had been lost, after a conversation with Labour general secretary Jennie Formby, who was sitting alongside her on the conference stage.Nichols then rejected calls for a full card-vote, which would have led to a more forensic count of delegates’ votes.Labour’s conference has been rocked by a series of rows, which kicked off on Friday night with a botched bid to abolish Tom Watson’s post of deputy leader.Watson will give his own speech on Tuesday. According to extracts released in advance, he will urge colleagues to “draw a line under” the controversy.“Turning in on ourselves is a gift to the Tories. I didn’t choose the row going into this vital week for our party and our country, I didn’t want it, I didn’t seek it and I regret it. It was damaging, isive and unnecessary. Unfortunately we cannot pretend it didn’t happen. But let us now draw a line under it.”He will urge his party to look to the future, and take on Boris Johnson and the Conservatives in the coming election.“Now, of all times, we cannot let the Tories escape scrutiny. Labour must be together. This is a time to keep our gaze high. To remember who we are, and what we believe, and what we’re trying to achieve. Social justice, equality and opportunity for everyone in our country.The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said the result of Monday’s vote showed that Corbyn still commands the loyalty of grassroots members. “The party is determined to unite behind its leader,” she said.Frontbenchers including Emily Thornberry and Clive Lewis have called for their party to declare its allegiance before a general election.Lewis said after Monday’s votes, “I think there will be huge disappointment amongst activists, members and many voters who were looking for a definitive outcome at this conference. But we know that the vast majority of MPs, the vast majority of the shadow cabinet, the Scottish party and the Welsh party will be campaigning for remain.”However, Labour strategists feared adopting an out-and-out remain position in advance of a general election would jeopardise their chances of holding on to scores of leave constituencies.The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, whose speech wound up the debate, did not explicitly call on Labour members to support the remain motion.A 62-year-old Labour veteran who joined the party in 1974 and worked for Labour icon Tony Benn during his deputy leadership campaign in the 1980s. Lansman served as director of operations for Corbyn’s leadership campaign. After Corbyn was elected as the leader of the Labour party in 2015, Lansman founded Momentum, a pro-Corbyn campaign group.Momentum, often described as a ‘party within a party’, has radically transformed the Labour party over the last four years. Local groups have challenged party orthodoxies and national membership rules, and fought to get their activists selected.“I don’t want the Labour party to become a faction fight,” Lansman said in a 2016 interview with the . “What I want is a level playing field. I want the Labour party to be able to have a democratic debate.” But in recent weeks, Lansman, and Momentum, are back in the news for being key figures behind another Labour party civil war.Lansman was behind the move to scrap Labour’s 40-year-old student wing last week, arguing the group needs reforming and had not paid its affiliation fees. Critics described the move as a cynical attempt to shut down a “moderate” wing of the party. Lansman also tabled a last-minute motion at the NEC on Friday night calling for Watson’s job to be scrapped. The motion was withdrawn after Corbyn intervened.“We need to ask the public whether they are prepared to leave with the best deal that can be secured. Or whether they wouldn’t rather remain in the EU. The people must have the final say.“A referendum in which remain should, and will, be on the ballot paper, along with the best leave deal that can be secured. We owe it to those who want to leave to secure that leave deal and put it to them in a referendum.Starmer was at the late-night meeting on Sunday that resulted in two motions being drafted. Only the one which closely echoed the NEC’s statement was passed.Speaking afterwards, Starmer told a fringe meeting that he had “mixed feelings” about the idea of Corbyn staying neutral in an election and argued that the Labour membership was so overwhelmingly pro-remain that it’s “obvious the way this is going to end up”.Earlier, Momentum founder Jon Lansman had urged members to vote with their conscience, complaining that the NEC, of which he is a member, had not had the opportunity to scrutinise the wording of the statement properly.“There was no meeting, no discussion, no consultation with the membership,” he said.Disappointed remain campaigners pointed out that Labour in Wales and Scotland has already adopted an anti-Brexit stance – and key members of the frontbench are on their side.Michael Chessum, of anti-Brexit campaign group Another Europe is Possible, said, “a fudge is not a unity position. It is deeply isive among members, and risks losing a large chunk of our voter base.”“This vote was set up as a loyalty test, but those grassroots activists who ran the campaign – Momentum activists, people who have fought for the left in Labour for years, know this is a nonsense. We have come so far in pushing Labour’s position towards a public vote, and while we might all be disappointed by this outcome, we must now prepare for the election. If Labour loses, the consequences will be dire.”Some exasperated remainers claimed the conference hall had been packed by Momentum, in order to ensure the vote was won.But a shadow minister close to Corbyn said members had put their loyalty to the leader first, saying: “This is Jeremy’s party.”Several senior Labour figures responded to the vote by suggesting they would make clear to voters that they will campaign for remain, whatever the party’s formal position at a general election.Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said, “I do not believe this decision reflects the views of the overwhelming majority of Labour members.”Other opposition parties immediately seized on Labour’s decision to continue to try to appeal to both leavers and remainers in a general election.Stephen Gethins, the Scottish National Party’s Brexit spokesman, said, “Jeremy Corbyn is stuck firmly on the fence, refusing to come down and today’s votes show the rest of the Labour party is happy to stay there. This is a real abdication of leadership.“It beggars belief that more than three years after the EU referendum, and knowing the damage Brexit will do, Labour is still arguing over its position.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed01a22740fd907e7816c854dd877572764a658c/0_98_5102_3063/master/5102.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1afd69e1b67d99914b4e5e57d6a93aa","title":"calls for uk to agree human rights backstop for northern ireland","story":"Commissioners on both sides of border urge protection of rights in Good Friday agreementThe UK government is being urged to agree to a “human rights backstop” in Northern Ireland to ensure “invisible” rights protected in the Good Friday agreement are guaranteed in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Northern Ireland and Ireland’s human rights commissioners are calling for a bill of rights or a guarantee that the EU charter of fundamental rights will remain in effect in Northern Ireland.These rights are already enshrined in Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement but will be shredded in a no-deal scenario.“They only apply to Northern Ireland. If we leave without a deal all those safeguards fall away,” says Les Allamby, chief commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.He and his counterpart south of the border, Emily Logan, have raised their concerns amid fears that the societal aspects of Brexit’s impact have been lost in the noise about border checks and trade.Human rights were listed in the Northern Ireland protocol in May’s deal, in recognition that human rights failed to keep pace with the rest of the UK, with abortion and same sex marriage two high-profile examples.They also reflected the post-conflict realities spelled out in the Good Friday agreement.Logan, head of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, said: “One of the rights listed in the Good Friday agreement is the ‘right to freely choose one’s place of residence’. Where else within the UK would have that written down, a basic right to chose where you live.”She added: “This is the reality, this is where Northern Ireland came from,” she added, pointing to page 20 of the Good Friday agreement which lists the human rights that need to be protected.Other areas of the Northern Ireland protocol include a pledge to keep pace and preserve EU law providing equality employment rights, self-employment rights, social services, and non-discrimination on race and ethnic origin.The two human rights commissions were set up as a result of the Good Friday agreement to protect and enforce rights on both sides of the border.But their respective chiefs lament the disproportionate attention given to trade, customs and tariffs. “We’ve been at the forefront of what’s been an invisible debate,” said Logan.They said too few politicians recognised that the region was already different to the rest of the UK because of the troubles.“Human rights was such a contested area in Northern Ireland,” said Allamby. “Human rights issues have not moved forward in the same pace as the rest of the UK – abortion and gay rights being two good examples.A bill of rights is a human rights backstop, an insurance policy.”They said one option is for the EU charter of fundamental rights to be preserved for Northern Ireland until an alternative is found.Allamby is also concerned that a no-deal Brexit will create a two-tier society in Northern Ireland, with Irish passport holders continuing to hold freedom of movement rights and potentially access to education and Erasmus programmes in all EU member states.He said that will breach the Good Friday agreement, where equality of those who identify as Irish andor British is enshrined.At the core of their argument is a concern that the social cohesion in cross-border communities will be washed away by Brexit.Pensioner clubs or church activities “on one side of the border or other” have flourished since 1998 helping to heal old wounds, said Allamby. “The fear is genuine for a generation who remember the troubles.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5b029eaf073fab5d0d5e540e1cc8c4b8a4ea375/0_120_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8dcd77b118cde783d158b7c16de3276a","title":"labours climate policies what are they and what do they mean","story":"The party trumpets a ‘green industrial revolution’ that unions back as a ‘just transition’What is the “green industrial revolution”?The Labour party’s answer to the climate emergency is to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions by investing in new industries and reforms to existing practices, to generate economic opportunities, particularly in areas where old industrial jobs have vanished. The ideas behind it are similar to those of the international move for a Green New Deal, espoused by leading Democrats in the US, but draw on the UK’s specific industrial resources, skills and heritage.What measures have been announced?On Monday, a £3.4bn national network of electric vehicle charging points, to ensure rapid refuelling for long and short journeys. There will also be interest-free loans for electric car buyers, with the aim of electric vehicles making up two-thirds of those on UK roads by 2030. Energy generation is another key target: home insulation and solar panels will be introduced free for more than a million people in low-income and social housing. If elected, a Labour government would renationalise the electricity grid, with a national energy agency and regional agencies taking over the task of delivering energy and balancing demand, while suppliers would remain private. Labour would also ban fracking.What other measures are likely?Labour will announce plans to remove planning restrictions that stop onshore windfarms. A large proportion of the proposed £250bn national transformation fund will be spent on the “green industrial revolution”, in ways yet to be laid out in detail. Additional Treasury policies could include adjusting the discount rate to make investments in green measures cheaper and changes to tax. Public procurement would be reformed so that suppliers to the public sector have to meet stringent green standards. And there may be a move to bring forward the government’s current target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050, enacted by Theresa May.What will this mean for jobs?Labour claims the measures will create tens of thousands of new jobs around the country, and unions are broadly in favour, backing a “just transition” from high-carbon industries to a low-carbon economy that would create high-quality jobs to replace those lost in industries such as coal.How is this being received?There is support among party members, with Labour for a Green New Deal and Momentum backing the idea, and it seems to play well among young people in particular. Businesses seem more wary, with the CBI telling the  that “renationalisation will disrupt the investment needed across water, rail and energy that all contribute to reducing emissions”.Will Brexit have an impact?Plans for green industry are being presented as separate to Brexit, representing a way forward that all sides of the Brexit debate can espouse, as they are targeted at new green jobs and an industrial revival. But a close relationship with Europe is viewed as essential, to collaborate on green standards and carbon accounting. The UK will host the major UN climate conference in 2020, called COP26, so Labour would seek to showcase the “green industrial revolution” on the international stage if in power next December.What about aviation?One key issue that must be addressed is the forecast rapid rise in emissions from aviation, and Labour has been ided over a new runway at Heathrow, in contrast to the Liberal Democrats who want a moratorium on all airport expansion. Improved and cheaper public transport is key to Labour plans: the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, pointed to flights within the UK that are much cheaper than rail journeys as one target for action."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e232fad95c65867e923b33192ad3b462866ef82/0_246_4884_2930/master/4884.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28d5b6bdd9cbb4ed7d90274c0eb10259","title":"labour unveils 83bn state windfarms plan before key climate vote","story":"Delegates at party conference to consider two motions on cutting UK carbon emissionsLabour is promising to build dozens of new state-owned offshore windfarms, at a cost of £83bn in public and private money. The plan comes as members prepare to debate the climate emergency at their party conference in what could be a fierce contest between heavyweight unions and grassroots campaigners.On Tuesday, delegates will be asked to vote on the party’s target to cut the UK’s carbon emissions to net zero. Two motions are to be put to members, one with a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2030 – which would be much more stringent than the government’s current target of net zero by 2050 – and one backed by the GMB union, which does not set a date.The motions emerged from the “compositing” process after 128 constituency parties sent climate-related motions to the conference. The 2030 motion came from the pressure group Labour for a Green New Deal and has the support of several smaller unions. Both motions could pass.Lauren Townsend, trade unionist and spokesperson for Labour for a Green New Deal, said: “Delegates have a clear choice: they can vote to lead the way on climate, responding to youth strikers’ calls for a 2030 decarbonisation target, or they could vote for a motion which risks leaving Labour with the least ambitious climate target of any major party.”The party leadership is focusing its efforts on the “green industrial revolution”, its strategy for reviving the economy, creating high-quality jobs and tackling the climate emergency, spearheaded by the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey.She pointed to the proposals for new offshore windfarms as a prime example of how the strategy would work. The new farms, which would provide electricity for 57m homes, were needed because the construction of new turbines by the private sector was too slow, despite falling costs, she said. The profits from the power generation would be reinvested to benefit coastal communities and tackle the climate emergency.A projected £600m to £1bn a year in profits would go to coastal communities for amenities such as harbour fronts, parks, leisure centres and libraries, with the remainder invested in improvements to the energy system and measures to combat global heating.Other “green industrial revolution” proposals include a £3.6bn national network of electric vehicle charging stations, solar panels for low-income and social housing tenants, and a programme of insulation for fuel-poor households.But he added: “In the huge push to reach net zero as fast and as cost-effectively as possible, renationalisation will disrupt the investment needed across water, rail and energy that all contribute to reducing emissions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f03106d88bfc2a64d2b1af614b2894e2cbf4ade/0_122_5300_3180/master/5300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdc62d16f8f6f7db13fa7b925cc172d2","title":"jonny bairstow left out of england test squad for new zealand tour cricket","story":"Jonny Bairstow has been challenged to fight his way back into England’s Test side as a specialist batsman after he was dropped for the upcoming series in New Zealand with the wicketkeeping role handed to Jos Buttler.In response to the 2-2 Ashes draw with Australia, Ed Smith, the national selector, has plumped for a reboot when England play a two-match series in late November (one that follows five Twenty20 internationals and sits outside of the World Test Championship points system).The uncapped Dominic Sibley and Zak Crawley will challenge Rory Burns and Joe Denly for spots in the top three, while the Lancashire bowlers Matt Parkinson and Saqib Mahmood also earn their first call-ups to both squads. Surrey’s precociously talented Ollie Pope gets a fresh Test chance after two fleeting appearances against India in 2018.But it is the decision to stand down Bairstow, just three days after renewing his Test central contract, that jumped off the page on Monday when Smith once again proved himself to be unafraid of shuffling the pack.The Yorkshireman boasts 69 caps but has made one half-century from 13 innings since regaining the gloves in February following a brief hiatus. Those returns sit in contrast with – but are possibly not unconnected to – his thundering performances as opener in England’s World Cup-winning team.Such is the sensitivity of the call and the cricketer concerned that Smith and his fellow selector, James Taylor, will now meet Bairstow in Leedson Wednesday, hoping they can convince a player who was previously so determined to keep wicket that he can instead convert himself into the batsman England would prefer.Smith said: “I’m using my words carefully. Jonny hasn’t been rested. That would be a cop out. However, I do see Jonny as being a top batsman, so I would say it’s an opportunity to reset and come back.“For whatever reason, whether it’s white-ball cricket, a busy schedule, keeping, I don’t have an answer. But I do have an aspiration and that’s that Jonny becomes a top batsman. I wouldn’t want to narrow his options but I want an open conversation with him. The primary issue is getting the most out of him as a batsman.”As well as diminishing returns and a growing propensity for being bowled, Bairstow’s demotion is linked with Root’s desire to return to No 4 come the first Test in Mount Maunganui on 21 November. Trevor Bayliss, the now departed head coach, felt No 3 was the right-hander’s best spot but with a replacement yet to be sourced, the captain’s personal vision has held sway.It is why England have opted for Sibley, the Warwickshire opener with 10 first-class hundreds in the past two years, and Crawley, the Kent right-hander picked more on style and potential, rather than choose between them. England also want Pope, notionally the reserve wicketkeeper for the second half of the tour with Ben Foakes placed on standby, to have an extended run at No 6 below Ben Stokes and above Buttler. The latter was first pick as selector last year, and a player now felt to be in need of a defined role beyond simply a lower-middle order wildcard.On Pope, who had shoulder surgery this summer, Smith said: “His numbers are outstanding but also his character – the way he came back in better shape is typical of him. We are excited about his future as we look to identify players with the DNA of a Test player.”With Jimmy Anderson now eyeing a return for South Africa in December – he and the similarly injured Mark Wood will attend a fast bowling camp there at the start of the month – his county teammate Mahmood comes in to offer pace and skills with the older ball. Parkinson, another rising star from Lancashire, will support Jack Leach.The leg-spinner’s big chance results from Moeen Ali’s desire to take a break from Test contention, one that has surprisingly earned the all-rounder an extended breather Smith cited Moeen as one of six players rested from the Twenty20 squad along with Jason Roy, who has lost his Test spot, Jofra Archer, Buttler, Root and Stokes.The World Twenty20 in Australia next October is a fresh priority for the white-ball side – Eoin Morgan will again captain after recommitting to the role – and England are keen to widen their pool of players in international cricket, allowing the more established players to further their experience in next year’s Indian Premier League.Somerset’s Tom Banton receives his first call-up as a result, following a blistering campaign in the T20 Blast, while fellow batsmen Sam Billings, James Vince and Dawid Malan all return. Pat Brown, the 21-year-old Worcestershire seamer with a deceptive knuckle ball, is another to benefit.Bairstow was also included but Smith said the decision on whether he or Billings keeps wicket will be made by Morgan and whoever is head coach. Chris Silverwood and Graham Thorpe, both in contention for the vacancy, sat in on selection.Test squad (21 Nov to 3 Dec): Joe Root (Yorkshire, captain), Jofra Archer (Sussex), Stuart Broad (Nottinghamshire), Rory Burns (Surrey), Jos Buttler (Lancashire), Zak Crawley (Kent), Sam Curran (Surrey), Joe Denly (Kent), Jack Leach (Somerset), Saqib Mahmood (Lancashire), Matthew Parkinson (Lancashire), Ollie Pope (Surrey), Dominic Sibley (Warwickshire), Ben Stokes (Durham), Chris Woakes (Warwickshire).T20 squad (1 Nov to 10 Nov): Eoin Morgan (Middlesex, captain), Jonny Bairstow (Yorks), Tom Banton (Somerset), Sam Billings (Kent), Pat Brown (Worcs), Sam Curran (Surrey), Tom Curran (Surrey), Joe Denly (Kent), Lewis Gregory (Somerset), Chris Jordan (Sussex), Saqib Mahmood (Lancs), Dawid Malan (Middlesex), Matt Parkinson (Lancs), Adil Rashid (Yorks), James Vince (Hants)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c25664d5e6360d00b4cd042d285bcfa6ee19cb96/0_86_5294_3176/master/5294.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0252c8a7a57eae1ae7a6675aebf36843","title":"kamaishi stadium rugby world cup tsunami","story":"Kamaishi, the small town in which 1,000 people died in the 2011 tsunami, welcomes the Rugby World Cup on WednesdayThere used to be a telephone box in the middle of the Kamaishi stadium. Nodoka Kikuchi reckons it was somewhere right around the halfway line. She’d know. She was the last person to ever use it. That was at a 2.45pm on 11 March 2011. She was 15, had just got out of high school, and was calling her parents to come and pick her up. A minute later, the great earthquake struck. “It started to shake from side-to-side,” she says. “It was terrible, I was holding on to the box, and my friend outside was hugging a gate, because it was the only way we could stand up.” Behind them, the earth of the school football pitch split open and water started to spray out of the ground “like a fountain”.Like all the children at Kamaishi High, and the next door Unosumai Elementary too, Nodoka knew exactly what to do. They were all supposed to meet at the evacuation point in schoolyard so the teachers could take a head count. But as she hurried there she heard one teacher shout: “We don’t have time to count! We should just run away!” And that’s what they did, all 570 of them, up into the mountains behind the school.They stopped at an old people’s home 800m uphill. The teachers were talking about what to do next when the aftershocks started. Rocks and boulders were tumbling down on them from the mountain so they ran again, hand in hand now, big kids paired with little kids, 300m further on, to the car park of a day care centre. The road was narrow, and they had to squeeze beside the cars coming up from the seafront. “There were about 600 people here, I was in the middle and I could see the people at the back didn’t have room to run in so I was shouting: ‘Making room! Run! Run! Please run!”•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterWhen they reached the car park, the teachers started another count. And that’s when Nodoka heard what she thought was a helicopter. Only she couldn’t understand why the whirring sound seemed to be coming up from all around, above and below and behind. Then she looked back.“Tsunami means wave, but it’s not a wave, I mean, that’s not what I saw. What I saw was like a great wall moving towards us.” Everyone fell silent. “Then someone shouted ‘tsunami!’ and I realised what it was.” They wanted to run higher, right up into the forests, but the ground was shaking now, and they were worried the mountains were going to fall down, just like the sea had risen up. The teachers led them safely to the highway instead, and they began the long walk inland. Two schoolchildren died. One, a friend of Nodoka’s, had stayed home, sick, and another had been collected by their parents. But everyone who stayed with the teachers survived.The tsunami killed more than a thousand people in Kamaishi, a town of just 35,000. Over 160 of the deaths were at the Unosumai District Disaster Control Centre, three minutes walk from Nodoka’s school. Many of the dead there had taken part in a tsunami drill just the previous week, but it had been so cold then that, instead of heading up the mountain where they were supposed to go, they’d stayed indoors at the Centre instead. When the tsunami came, that’s what they did again. The flood there was 11m deep.In the years afterwards, they would call what happened at Nodoka’s school “the miracle of Kamaishi”. But she and her friends have never liked to that name. “A miracle,” says her colleague Miyuki Kanie, “would have saved everyone.” And besides, she adds, it wasn’t an act of God that got them through it. The children lived because their teachers made the right decisions. And the townspeople have carved that lesson in stone at the new Tsunami memorial. “Just run! Run uphill! Don’t worry about others. Save yourself first. And tell the future generations that a tsunami once reached this point, and that those who survived were those who ran.”The “miracle of Kamaishi” has become a famous story, one which has been repeated over and again in the media here. They even made a film about it. It’s one of those tales we tell each other for succour, because it allows us to believe in hope and mercy where there isn’t any. And in that way it’s similar to how we’ll talk about the new rugby ground they’ve built on the site of those two old schools, the Kamaishi Recovery Memorial Stadium. From our remove, flying in for these few days, the two World Cup matches that will be played here – Fiji face Uruguay on Wednesday– seem a powerful symbol of Kamaishi’s redevelopment. But this isn’t our story to tell.“For most of the old people, the World Cup coming here is very meaningful,” says Miyuki, who moved here last March. “The local team were very strong a long time ago, when they won the championship seven years in a row, so rugby is especially popular with old people. But to tell the truth, young people are not so interested.” It’s a fact, she says, that the recovery has moved more quickly here than elsewhere because the World Cup has spurred it on. There are only around 20 local families left in temporary accommodation, and they will be rehoused by the end of the year. “So I don’t think many people were against the idea of the World Cup,” she says, “because of that, and because they knew how important rugby was to Kamaishi. It has given people new energy. But I know some kids have complicated feelings about it.”Nodoka is one of them. “When I heard the stadium was being built I was shocked,” she says, “because it felt like they were destroying my memories. I had such complicated feelings then, thinking about our school, and our lives, it was a big loss.” Over time, though, as she has watched the construction work, that has changed. “While I watched the stadium going up I started to digest all my feelings, the sadness, the guilt, the nostalgia. And I feel like they’ve settled now. It’s all passed. It’s just part of my history, of who I am. And I feel like if they hadn’t destroyed the school to make this new stadium, I never would have gone through that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/928e0289fd46e5c78c16b65498032ea2c547c8fd/0_302_5124_3075/master/5124.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=168a2136c3722e40914cfbec3a55e131","title":"russia face tokyo olympics ban over inconsistent moscow lab data athletics","story":"Russia faces the prospect of being banned from next year’s Olympics in Tokyo after the World Anti-Doping Agency gave it three weeks to explain apparent inconsistencies in data from its Moscow laboratory or to suffer the consequences.Wada confirmed on Monday that it had opened a formal compliance procedure against Russia and also asked it to explain how a number of positive drugs tests had been deleted from a database extracted from the lab in January.Sources close to the situation believe there is now a strong possibility Russia will be banned from the Olympic Games and it is not inconceivable such a punishment could also extend to competitions in any sport signed up to Wada’s code, including the football World Cup.On Monday, the IAAF, athletics’ governing body, said its council had unanimously agreed that the Russian Athletics Federation would remain suspended, as it has been since 2015, meaning that its athletes will still not be able to compete under their own flag when the World Athletics Championships begin in Doha, Qatar on Friday. Instead they will compete as “authorised neutral athletes”.Stanislav Pozdnyakov, the president of Russia’s Olympic Committee, admitted the situation was “very serious” and could jeopardise Russia’s Olympic participation.“We have spent vast diplomatic efforts to regain the trust of the international sports community and for Russian athletes to have the right to take part in Olympics without any restrictions,” he said. “But now we again run the risk of facing sanctions.”Wada lifted its ban on the Russian Anti-Doping Agency in September 2018, much to the anger of the wider global anti-doping community and athlete groups. Critics said the Russians had refused to accept the findings of the McLaren report that concluded its government was involved in a massive doping conspiracy.Wada said it had to compromise in order to get the data from the Moscow lab, which it had wanted since 2015, in order to build cases against athletes suspected of being involved in a state-sponsored doping programme.However, Wada’s board was told on Monday that investigators had also found inconsistencies between a data set passed to it by a whistleblower in 2017 and the evidence extracted in January.Jonathan Taylor, chairman of Wada’s committee tasked with overseeing Russia’s compliance, told the New York Times the Russians needed to “pull a rabbit out of a hat” to avoid new penalties. “There were positive findings that were deleted the question is why … We will give them a chance to explain.”The Russian sports minister, Pavel Kolobkov, said the ministry would cooperate with Wada, adding that experts in the field of digital technology would be involved.The chief executive of the US Anti-Doping Agency, Travis Tygart, who has repeatedly warned that Wada was being played by Russia, said he was unsurprised by the latest news.“Let’s hope there are no secret backroom deals but that justice is finally served in an open, transparent and public manner,” he said. “The world, and especially clean athletes, have already been yanked around enough already.”The IAAF also confirmed it would meet the German TV channel ZDF, which said on Sunday it has footage of two Kenyan athletes – one male, one female – competing in the world championships injecting the blood-boosting drug EPO. ZDF also made allegations about positive doping tests being hidden in the country.Athletics Kenya has denied any wrongdoing, with Barnabas Korir, a member of its executive, telling ZDF: “We make sure that our national team follows the rules. The athletes know the consequences: if someone has doped, they are thrown out of the team and never wear the national colours of Kenya again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0b1c5ebbdf3f50bbc7196aec056df3c8ffd68bc/0_72_3709_2225/master/3709.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4017b372761d85e1faae090aab9a4782","title":"ferrari f1 formula one gimmicks singapore grand prix","story":"The Singapore Grand Prix was a banner race for the Scuderia but Mercedes have lessons to learn before the next raceThe Scuderia’s one-two in Singapore suggested they may finally have brought the SF90 up to speed. Struggling through slow corners all season, the car at Marina Bay, with a swatch of upgrades, had the grip on turn-in and balance that allowed Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel really to attack the corners. Leclerc’s qualifying lap was a stunning piece of driving but he was able to do it because the car was where he wanted it. Though they looked resurgent, chicken counting is premature. As Lewis Hamilton pointed out, you do not find 30 points of downforce from nowhere. The car was once more in its window but it clearly works well on the C5 compound of tyre – the softest rubber Pirelli can offer. It was last used in Canada where Vettel also found the sweet spot. They have without doubt made a major improvement but performances in Sochi and Suzuka will prove just how far they have come. If Ferrari do maintain this form, they will be at the front of the field.Leclerc was aggrieved at the pitstop strategy where Vettel passed him for track position and ultimately the win. However, after being debriefed by the team the Monegasque accepted their decision to pit Vettel first made sense. Theories that Ferrari were favouring Vettel after Leclerc failed to give him a tow in qualifying at Monza simply do not hold up. Instead Ferrari made another well-judged strategy call, reflecting a team operationally on form. In first and third on track, they pitted Vettel to cover Max Verstappen and with hope that he might undercut Hamilton. They, as with every other team, had not anticipated the huge undercut that the hard tyres offered – a 3.9-second advantage. Vettel flew on his out lap while Leclerc, despite the pedestrian pace of the first 19 laps, discovered that, when asked to push, his soft tyres had gone. Both were circumstances the team had not expected, rather than conspiracy. Their call was undeniably right. They had a one-two on track and had forced Mercedes into an alternate strategy that failed.Not only did Ferrari find outstanding pace but Mercedes were not at their usual level of flawless execution. Ferrari went all out for a qualifying setup, which proved to be vital. With Ferrari’s weakness through slow corners Mercedes, understandably perhaps, expected to have an advantage and had consequently concentrated on a strong race setup. They were clearly quicker on the long runs in practice but come Saturday morning, when the Ferraris came alive, the Mercedes’ single-lap pace looked under threat and so it was. With track position so important Ferrari’s qualifying allowed them to dictate the race, hence the slow pace at the start to back up the midfield to prevent an aggressive undercut from behind. Mercedes then rejected Hamilton’s request to try an undercut and their gamble to send him long failed. Their chief strategist, James Vowles, admitted responsibility. Mercedes, however, will doubtless learn their lessons. Similar miscalculations in Germany were immediately followed by a strategic masterclass in Hungary.F1’s sporting director, Ross Brawn, has long been considering the format of race weekends as part of his process of reinventing the sport for 2021. He has said they are to try some new ideas in 2020, especially for Friday and Saturday – including the possibility of a sprint race and changes to qualifying. Ferrari’s team principal, Mattia Binotto, has said these have, in principle, already been agreed for three races in 2020.One of the ideas that has been mooted, however, was dismissed by drivers in Singapore – that of replacing qualifying with a sprint race started in reverse championship order. Hamilton sighed with frustration at the concept. “The people who proposed that don’t really know what they are talking about,” he said. Vettel described it as: “Complete bullshit. I don’t know which genius came up with that.” Other series such as F2 do use reverse grids but, much as F1 can adapt, this would be a gimmick beneath the sport. The drivers’ reactions suggest it will not be part of the three race test weekends next season.Much as Marina Bay at night sells its rich visual spectacle, on track the race was again less than gripping. Indeed , for all that broadcasters eulogise over how it looks, with grandiose helicopter shots of pleasure palace hotels looming over the circuit, it is simply window dressing for a race where out at the front it was a procession decided by strategy. Had it taken place in daylight, this would have been eerily similar to some of the least enlivening meetings at Valencia.There was overtaking and there were battles lower in the field but largely because of drivers being out of position. Hamilton asked the media if they had been “bored” and described it as “worse than Monaco almost”. It is a tough mental and physical test but that does not translate well into entertainment for fans. Nor does the near impossibility of overtaking in similarly matched cars, as proved by the top six. Hamilton at least had a suggestion that the organisers might think on: if the final corner were a tight hairpin, drivers could close properly on one another before the straight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bac40c94abcd685a259b01db9a033e1df8be845c/0_26_3831_2299/master/3831.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eddd459b19e0882995af45e57077e4e0","title":"victory for google in landmark right to be forgotten case","story":"Court rules Google does not have to remove sensitive information from global searchGoogle does not have to remove links to sensitive personal data globally, Europe’s top court has ruled in a landmark case that pits privacy rights against the right of free speech.The ruling centres on Google’s dispute with France’s privacy watchdog, CNIL, which in 2015 told Google to delist information from internet search results globally upon request, in what is called the “right to be forgotten”.CNIL fined Google €100,000 (£88,000) because it refused to comply.

Thanks to traditional production methods that create high-quality, long-lasting jeans, Japanese denim has iconic status among “connoisseur denim heads”, who are prepared to pay £250 or more for a pair.Major Japanese brands, such as Momotoro, Pure Blue Japan and Studio d’Artisan, all have stores in the big cities, but arguably the best – and certainly the most interesting – place to buy jeans in Japan is hundreds of kilometres away from Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, in a sleepy coastal district on the southern coast of Honshu, the biggest of the four main islands. An hour’s train ride south of Okayama city, Jeans Street in the port town of Kojima is a hub of 38 specialist denim shops. The “street” is actually four streets – each strung with lines of jeans as if someone has just hung them out to dry. Shopping here couldn’t be further from the big city experience of Japan – there are no crowds, no neon lights, no department stores and no subcultures on display. I strolled near-empty streets, and browsed quiet shops where I was left in peace to look around.More than just a retail experience, Jeans Street is a homage to denim, with the hard-wearing blue fabric referenced in everything from vending machines to drain covers and signs to public loos. Some stores are traditional in style, with sliding screen doors, tatami mats and tranquil gardens others are tiny modern boutiques. Inside they sell not just beautifully made jeans but shirts, jackets, skirts, coats, aprons and wallets. To understand why one of the country’s most intriguing shopping experiences is in a small, unassuming town in Okayama prefecture, you have to rewind a few decades – to postwar Japan. One of the side-effects of the US occupation during the second world war was an obsession with Americana among Japanese youth, who embraced American pop culture and created a healthy black market in used Levi’s and Lee jeans.In Kojima, textile factories that had for decades specialised in school uniforms and workwear saw a business opportunity. The first Japanese denim company chose the most American-sounding name it could come up with: Big John. And then it did the same for its women’s brand: Betty Smith. Initially, Big John used denim fabric and sewing machines imported from the US, but in the 1970s it started to produce its own denim using old shuttle looms and traditional indigo-dyeing techniques – and Japanese jeans were born.Big John is still going strong and, as the godfather of Japanese denim, is still a much-loved brand. The shop in Kojima is a vast emporium with jeans piled on tables, hanging on racks in multiple colours, stacked in huge boxes. Its walls are festooned with vintage posters and venerable pairs of jeans. I stood in a denim daze, overwhelmed by the variety on offer. The smaller boutiques, with their minimal clothes rails, were easier to navigate and more soothing. I loved Apple Do, a neat little store with beautifully made jeans, shirts and, most covetable of all, denim coats. I was welcomed by a smiling shop assistant who, dressed from head to toe in denim, was the epitome of Japanese style. I wanted everything in the shop, but resisted, knowing I could never pull off the double – or triple – denim look.I was in danger of trailing in and out of most of the 38 shops and leaving empty-handed. So I determined to get a pair of jeans in the next shop I saw: Momotaro. The name translates as Peach Boy, a character in an Okayama folk tale. I took about 10 pairs into the tiny changing room, refusing to leave until I had chosen at least one pair. They are without doubt the best jeans in my wardrobe – made of durable raw denim that will take months to soften. A more decisive shopper than me could come away from Jeans Street laden with an array of wardrobe staples that would last a lifetime, but wandering the streets is just as much fun as riffling through racks of garments.A short walk away is Cafe Wagen, opened in 1969 – around the time the first jeans were being made in Japan – by Shoichi Katayama (pictured below), who still presides over the barely changed establishment today. The cafe may serve burgers and steak alongside yakisoba (stir-fried noodles), but Wagen has a distinctly Japanese feel, calmly serving lunch to local workers just as it has for 50 years. Katayama’s other great love is vintage cars – every year he organises the Kojima car rally, with sponsorship from the two original brands: Big John and Betty Smith. Nearby is the Betty Smith museum, another spot that reflects denim’s dual heritage: the building looks like a general store from the American west but is made from blackened timbers – charring wood is a centuries-old Japanese technique for preserving it. Inside, the museum charts the history of denim, from workwear to cutting-edge brands, with some of the first pairs of Big John and Betty Smith jeans on display. You can order a pair of bespoke jeans, customising them from an array of thread colours and rivet designs.The adjoining Betty Smith shop has yet more desirable items, from denim skirts to branded T-shirts, aprons, and of course jeans. I wish I’d bought a suitcase worth of denim, but it’s worth a trip even if you have no plans to spend your yen on clothes.

The preliminary event schedule for adults includes trivia night, book, crocheting and writing clubs.“It’s a beacon for the city,” said Dennis Walcott, president and CEO of Queens Public library. “Its location is just ideal both for the borough of Queens but as well as for New York City overall … Being located between two ferries gives the opportunity for people to come over, visit and relax and surrounded by parkland as well. So it’s a beautiful place for what libraries are about in today’s society.”The opening of Hunters Point – the early design of which was reached by Steven Holl Architects in 2010, with construction starting in 2015 – is being seen as a positive sign for the health of New York libraries, and has been largely welcomed by the community despite some criticism over its price tag.When it opens today, it will become the 217th in New York, where libraries attract a total of 37.7 million people per year. In Queens, one of America’s largest public library services, Walcott says none of the borough’s residents lives more than approximately one mile away from a library.But in the age of Donald Trump, whose administration has proposed budget cuts that would close the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the government agency that gives grants to libraries and museums, the high profile opening is a political statement, too.While most library funding comes from local sources, American Libraries Association (ALA) spokesperson Shawnda Hines said federal money is still “vital” for their survival. “For three years in a row, the Trump administration has threatened to eliminate IMLS altogether,” she said.“Obviously libraries are more important than ever under Donald Trump, who is assaulting our sense of decency and who has sought to dismantle the civic space and stability as we knew it,” said Jimmy Van Bramer, local council member and chairman of New York City Council’s cultural affairs and libraries committee.He said Americans should respond to Trump by improving their libraries and other spaces where “people can come together, talk, meet and actually defend their democracy and their neighborhoods”.Despite increased internet access and growing distractions, libraries have proven remarkably resilient in the US, adapting their services to the changing needs of communities. Next year, libraries are expected to play a central role in the US census when, for the first time ever, it will be available online.According to the latest Public Libraries Survey report, published by the IMLS in May, although library funding across the US improved in the three years leading up to 2016, it remained below pre-recession levels.Meanwhile, visits remain relatively high. In 2016, there were 1.35bn visits to public libraries. This compares to 1.39bn the previous year.It’s in stark contrast to Britain, where last year nearly 130 public libraries closed.“No one would have predicted 30 years ago that of all the public institutions we have, the library would be the most adept at transforming to meet needs of contemporary citizens. But it has,” said Eric Klinenberg, director of the Institute for Public Knowledge at New York University and author of Palaces for the People.Hunters Point, he said, is a reminder of the potential of public architecture. “We don’t need to depend on tech firms and star architects to have beautiful buildings.”Citing Oodi, in Helsinki, Finland, the current star of the library world, Central library in Calgary, Canada, and, in the US, Austin Central library in Texas and the library systems in Columbus, Ohio, Seattle and Chicago, he said “there are a lot of great libraries”, but that America could still do better.“The American public library system is truly special by international standards. But that’s only because we’ve inherited a tremendous gift from the generations that have come before us and for the most part what we’ve been doing is squandering our inheritance.”There has been some criticism of the project, however. Slow Build, a 2017 report by Centre for an Urban Future named Hunters Point library as an example of a project that “grew dramatically in scope and cost” after being given the go-ahead.Last year a petition, signed by over 1,000 people called it “an embarrassment and a prime example of New York City government waste and inefficiency”.But in Hunters Point, residents were excited about the opening. At a nearby play area, Luciana Santos, 31, who looks after two young children, had already looked at the library’s events schedule.“It looks great … It took a while to get ready I think, but now everyone’s excited for opening,” she said.Reading a book nearby with her daughter, Laura Varland, 33, said she currently goes to Court Square library, which is about a mile away, but plans to switch allegiance to Hunters Point when it opens because it’s closer to home.“It’s a beautiful building,” she said. “It’s an architectural design. It’s taken a while to be built, so we’ve all been watching it with bated breath … and waiting for it to open, so we’re excited that it’s finally opening.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/09/24/FINAL_BY_CONROY.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c25251ab22449d68f3b36ae71d4f56a","title":"area 51 raid event what happened nevada","story":"No one had any idea what to expect of a plan for people to meet in Rachel, Nevada, to see for themselves if the government was hiding aliensIn the middle of the Nevadan desert, outside a secretive US military airstrip, I found the world’s strangest social media convention.Dozens of young, good-looking, often costumed people were running around filming each other with semi-professional video rigs. They were YouTube and Instagram stars – or, more often, aspiring stars – here to “storm” Area 51 for the benefit of their followers and free the aliens held captive within. Or at least film themselves talking about it.Joining them was a ragged army of hundreds of stoners, UFO buffs, punk bands, rubberneckers, European tourists, people with way too much time on their hands, and meme-lords in Pepe the Frog costumes – all here because of the Internet, the ironic and the earnest alike, for a party at the end of the earth.Three months earlier, on 20 June 2019, the podcaster Joe Rogan released an interview with Bob Lazar. Lazar is a cult figure in UFO circles he claims to have studied flying saucers at Area 51, the classified air force base in Nevada where the US government is rumored – by some – to make secret contact with extraterrestrial beings.Rogan’s millions of listeners heard the interview.One of those listeners was Matty Roberts, a college student, anime enthusiast and video gamer in Bakersfield, California. Inspired by the Rogan podcast, Roberts created a joke Facebook event: “Storm Area 51, They Can’t Stop All of Us.” According to the plan, people would meet in Rachel, Nevada – the closest town to Area 51 – in the early morning of 20 September, then swarm the defenses and see for themselves if the government was hiding aliens.Things snowballed. Within hours, the page had thousands of RSVPs. Within days it had more than a million. The air force warned that things would end badly for anyone attempting a raid. The FBI paid the hapless Matty Roberts a house call.So he came up with a brilliant pivot: why not channel this momentum into a Burning Man-style music festival in the desert? He joined forces with Connie West, the operator of Rachel’s sole inn and restaurant, to plan what they called Alienstock.Then came the first schism. Scornful of the internet interlopers, the Alien Research Center in nearby Hiko, Nevada, decided to host its own Area 51 event the same weekend – for serious ufologists.Roberts and West pressed on. But the town of Rachel (population: 54) lacked the infrastructure to handle thousands of conspiracy theorists and gawkers descending on rural Nevada. The local authorities feared potential calamity: people dying of dehydration in the desert, angry landowners, madmen with guns.On 10 September, nine days before the event, Roberts backed out. He wanted no involvement in a “Fyre Fest 2.0”, he told the media. He accused West of being insufficiently prepared for the coming flood. Budweiser offered to sponsor a free, alternative Alienstock event in a “safe, clean” venue in downtown Las Vegas. Roberts urged people to go there instead.West refused to cancel the concert in the desert. She’d already sunk thousands of dollars of her own money into the event, she told reporters as she held back tears. Alienstock would happen, she said, whether anyone liked it or not.Now there were three rival events all happening on the same weekend – one in Las Vegas, another in Rachel and a third in Hiko. No one had any idea how many people were coming.I came equipped with a duffel bag of Hawaiian shirts and a case of vape cartridges, which I hoped to use as currency in the event of civilizational collapse in the desert.But the desert would wait. The “Area 51 Celebration” in downtown Las Vegas did not get off to a promising start. When I arrived, shortly after 7pm, the outdoor venue – heavily bedecked with glowing neon alien signage – was mostly empty except for cops and local newscasters. A DJ blasted dubstep to a bare dancefloor. The venue even had a swimming pool, bathed in green light and watched by a bored-looking lifeguard.I feared it might be a long night. I ordered a whiskey-and-water the bartender filled a plastic stadium cup to the brim.Then people started trickling in. Everyone was wearing their best alien-themed rave attire: one woman wore a shiny, and discomfitingly rubbery, head-to-toe alien costume. Another had a Rick-and-Morty-patterned dress. Three men tore up the dancefloor in matching alien-motif onesies. Someone carried a sign that said GREEN LIVES MATTER.I talked to two people who’d driven six hours from Tucson, Arizona, on a whim to attend. One was wearing a Flat Earth Society T-shirt, though he said it was ironic.I spied Matty Roberts in the center of a swirling mass of people, holding court. He was wearing a Slayer hat and black T-shirt his long, dark hair flowed majestically down his back. He looked like a heavy metal-listening, Mountain Dew-drinking samurai lord, surrounded by courtiers and supplicants. I fought my way over.He was in high spirits. “I’m absolutely amazed at how things turned out, and it’s incredible,” he told me as he signed autographs. I opened my mouth to ask a follow-up question but he was swallowed up again by the crowd.By around 9pm, there were a couple hundred people jerking spasmodically to dubstep.A woman who introduced herself as Shereel (“C-H-E-R-Y-L”) said she was happy to be at the rave but disappointed she couldn’t make the event in the desert.“This is the first time since Roswell that people like us are all coming together,” she said. “Even if nothing happens, we tried.”The DJ interrupted his set to thank Matty Roberts and give a “special shout-out” to Bob Lazar. The crowd cheered.A warm wind was whipping through the arena. As the wind buffeted us and the rave lights flickered overhead, you could almost believe a UFO really was about to descend.The next morning I got in my rental car and headed north.The outskirts of Las Vegas – casinos, strip clubs, endless billboards for personal injury lawyers – dropped away rapidly. Now there was just desert in every direction, stunning in its vastness and austere beauty. Mountains towered over the highway, surrounded by hilly plains of cacti and scrub.Soon most human settlement was gone. There was nothing alongside the highway – no strip malls, no fast food joints, and, I noticed, worryingly few gas stations. I had at least two hours of driving ahead, though I knew I was going in the right direction: every vehicle I saw was a police car, an RV or a news satellite van.As I drove I listened to rightwing talk radio, then Top 40, then country, then a Bible discussion call-in show, then some Spanish-language stations, then static. A talk station interviewed the mother of a police officer killed by an undocumented immigrant. Sean Hannity made fun of the climate strike, and every talkshow discussed the New York Times’ recent, partly retracted accusation against Brett Kavanaugh. It was, they pointed out, yet another sign of bias in the liberal media.The first gas station was bustling with people buying water and jerry cans of gas. In the parking lot there was a camper van marked “AREA 51 – HERE WE COME”.Finally, two hours north of Las Vegas, I saw the exit for State Route 375 – also known, since its formal renaming in 1996, as Extraterrestrial Highway.The “Groom Lake airfield” – Area 51 – is part of a massive complex of military installations. Their activities are classified and the skies above are restricted air space. Little is known about what goes on there, though the air force tests experimental stealth aircraft, which may account for some UFO sightings.Of course, military pilots are themselves known to report seeing what they refer to as “unexplained aerial phenomena”. (Even the New York Times has reported on it.)In the 2000s, Congress established an “advanced aviation threat identification program” to study the problem. The program wasn’t classified, but it “operated with the knowledge of an extremely limited number of officials”, according to Politico. The then Nevada senator Harry Reid helped secure the funding.That’s the end of the history lesson. The reader is free to investigate further and come to their own conclusions.On the way to Rachel, I stopped at the rival festival at the Alien Research Center in Hiko. It was heavy on souvenir sellers, though there were some hardcore ufologists. A group called the Mutual UFO Network (Mufon) gave me a pamphlet offering certification to be a “field investigator”.If anything, the ufologists were more the exception than the rule. I had expected most Area 51 Stormers to be conspiracy theorists, 4chan types, or people on the fringe political spectrum, but a lot – probably most – were normies on a lark, or foreigners in search of peak Americana.Two young men – one Swiss German, the other Japanese – told me they were friends who’d met at an English as a second language program in New York. A group of Britons told me they’d been taking a road trip up the west coast, heard about the Area 51 business, and decided to take a detour.This was a common theme: “Well, I’d been thinking about taking a road trip anyway, sooo…”When my car turned the last switchback into the valley toward Area 51, the car radio, theretofore static, suddenly started blasting Smetana’s Má Vlast in eerie, crystal-perfect sound. The aliens, it seemed, were classical music buffs.Rachel came into view – a tiny, one-horse town besieged by cars and tents and camper vans. Including the cops, EMTs, festival organizers, and so on, there looked to be a couple thousand people – not the two million who had RSVP’d to the Facebook event, nor the 30,000 the sheriff feared, but more than I thought would follow through.Contrary to the wild warnings about a Fyre festival 2.0, things appeared mostly under control. Festival marshals waved me along to an assigned lot.My neighbors at the parking lot-slash-campsite were a punk band called Foreign Life Form. They weren’t part of the planned music lineup, one Life Form explained as he ate Chef Boyardee room-temperature from a can, but when they heard about Alienstock, it seemed like fate. They were trying to find the concert organizer to get added to the billing. To help seal the deal they’d painted their faces and arms green.My other neighbor, an erudite, joint-smoking history podcaster from Oregon, wore a T-shirt that said “Take me to your dealer”. He and his son had had the shirts custom-made the Life Forms were disappointed they couldn’t buy some.Getting to the actual entrance to Area 51 took another 20 minutes of driving on an unmarked, unpaved road. Clouds of chalk billowed behind the cars coming and going.At the end of the road was a drab military checkpoint flanked by concertina wire and threatening signs. The sign prohibiting photography was clearly a dead letter.Rotating shifts of law enforcement officers of every variety – sheriff’s deputies, state troopers, game wardens, park rangers – kept a watchful eye on everything. They seemed relaxed, though, and looked like they were having as good a time as the ostensible Stormers. After all, this was an excuse for them to hang out at Area 51, too.(To my knowledge, no one actually raided Area 51, besides the two Dutch YouTubers who had tried to sneak through the perimeter two weeks earlier and ended up in jail instead.)In addition to YouTube vloggers and Instagram influencers, there were more than a few actual journalists. Watching them scurry around diligently with tape recorders reminded me that I needed to find a Quirky Character who could give On-Scene Color. A talkative UFO buff would be ideal but the other journalists had already claimed most of the good ones.I couldn’t avoid noticing a pair of men in huge, papier-mache Pepe the Frog heads. The vloggers loved them, and the Pepes enjoyed mugging for the cameras. “My God,” a girl said, “they’re adorable.”Under their frog heads, the Pepes were two young Latino guys from California. When I asked them what they thought of the frog’s association with the alt-right, one seemed confused. The other nodded in recognition but claimed he just thought the symbol was fun.He said, “It’s all about the –”“Memes,” finished the other. They both laughed.I asked if it wasn’t weird for them, as Latinos, to embrace a symbol affiliated with white nationalists.“Yeah, I mean, they’re a little, like, extreme for me sometimes,” one said. “But sometimes you feel like they’re right about some stuff.”“Like the idea that we’re all living in a world of clowns,” he clarified.Tendrils of fog hung over Alienstock. The temperature was dropping fast and the sun was low and pink in the sky. The sunset was sublime but I had a long drive to my motel ahead and a sick feeling that I should have left half an hour ago.I bid farewell to the history podcaster. He reminded me that the area was open grazing land. “Watch out for the steer,” he said. “They go right out into the road.”The next morning I debated whether to squeeze in another trip out to Alienstock and couldn’t quite find the willpower. It was time to get back to civilization, I decided. Or at least Las Vegas.I stopped at the gas station in Alamo, near Rachel. The town felt hungover, and it still had a day to go. Most of the locals seemed unsure quite how to feel about the whole thing. It was a boon to the local economy, yes, but also a financial disaster for the county government. There were rumors that the district attorney was planning to sue Connie West, or Matty Roberts, or even Facebook.Most, though, just seemed excited at the idea that their corner of the world might become something bigger than a gas stop on the way elsewhere.Everyone vowed that next year, they’d be ready."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba9fc36cd57dc80313620875a9e7ebaacffa6c67/0_8_2438_1463/master/2438.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe865bdc9197d7b4a63c6e2840dc4f8b","title":"saudi arabia iran france germany uk","story":"PM says president could come up with better pact, in apparent shift from European positionBoris Johnson has sided with Donald Trump in calling the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran a “bad deal”, while praising the US president as a “very brilliant negotiator” capable of achieving a better one.The prime minister’s remarks, made in a NBC interview, marked a sharp change in UK rhetoric. British leaders, including Johnson, had until now upheld the 2015 accord between six major powers and Iran as a major diplomatic achievement.British officials insisted that the prime minister continued to support full compliance with that deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA).However, Johnson had clearly come to the UN determined to emphasise his personal relationship with Trump, who reneged on the JCPOA last year, praising him highly in the interview, comments that may prompt an interesting discussion when Johnson meets with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani for a bilateral meeting today. Asked about the JCPOA, Johnson said: “The reality is, as President Trump rightly said, it was a bad deal. It had many defects. Iran was and is behaving disruptively in the region.”“If it was a bad deal – and I’m willing to accept that, it had many, many defects – then let’s do a better deal.“And I think there’s one guy who can do a better deal and one guy who understands how to get a difficult partner like Iran over the line and that is the president of the United States.”Johnson described Trump as a “very, very brilliant negotiator” who could produce a “Trump deal”.On the prospect of a US military response to the attacks, Johnson replied: “It’s not something that I think will necessarily help the situation.”Johnson’s remarks came as the UK, France and Germany declared they were convinced that Iran was responsible for airstrikes against Saudi oil installations on 14 September and called on Iran to negotiate over its role in the Middle East and its development of missiles as well as its nuclear programme.In a joint statement at the UN general assembly on Monday, the three European governments supported the US and Saudi claim that Iran had carried out the missile and drone attack on 14 September against an oil field and petrochemical processing facility, but added they maintained support for the JCPOA.“It is clear to us that Iran bears responsibility for this attack. There is no other plausible explanation. We support ongoing investigations to establish further details,” the statement said following a meeting between Johnson, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron.The statement said that the attack raised the risk of a major new conflict, which was of concern to the whole world. It underlined the importance of collective security and multilateral action.The statement also restated the European nations’ commitment to the 2015 nuclear deal.Asked whether Johnson’s undertaking in the European statement clashed with his remarks on the US evening news, a UK official insisted there was a coherent message.“What this is about is achieving compliance, and we’re open to various ways of achieving that,” he said.“Our commitment is to working with all of our partners to find solutions to bring Iran into compliance. In his interview I think he was clear he wants to work with all our partners.”The European agreement called for Iran to return to the limits on its nuclear programme imposed by that agreement, which Tehran has begun to ignore more than a year after the US withdrew from the deal.But the statement said Iran would now have to go further, arguing “the time has come for Iran to accept a long-term negotiation framework for its nuclear program, as well as regional security issues, which include its missile programs,” the statement said.Iran has denied responsibility, insisting the strikes were launched from Yemen by their Houthi allies.On Monday night Iran ruled out the possibility of negotiating a new deal with major powers. Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a tweet that European partners have failed to fulfil their commitments under a 2015 nuclear pact.France has sent investigators to examine the weapons fragments collected at the site of the attacks. The UN has also sent an investigative team, which has yet to deliver a report. Iran has said it will not necessarily accept the results of that report, calling into question the impartiality of the UN team.The European statement comes as the US and Iran are poised to clash at the UN general assembly. Donald Trump is due to address the assembly on Tuesday, and the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, who has already arrived in New York, will speak the next day. Both are expected to blame the other for the worsening instability in the Gulf."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/613af4d4759a03e151330f305a74ab0c487f0fd3/0_320_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab07e6ab8b7f65a2d9c77f02437fab8c","title":"france debates law lesbians single women ivf","story":"Politicians brace for protests over plan to end discrimination over fertility treatmentsThe French parliament will on Tuesday begin a heated debate over Emmanuel Macron’s first major social reform: a law to end discrimination over women’s reproductive rights by allowing lesbian couples and single women access to medically assisted procreation, such as IVF and sperm donation.Under current French law, only heterosexual couples who have been married or living together for more than two years have the right to access procedures such as in vitro fertilisation, artificial insemination or sperm donation. The centrist government wants to extend this right to all women by passing a new law before the summer.But the parliament is braced for tense scenes amid vocal opposition from conservative groups, rightwing politicians and senior Catholic figures. Demonstrators will take to the streets in Paris on 6 October in a march organised by conservative groups who say the new law will “deprive children of a father”. The head of the French conference of Catholic bishops has argued it is the “duty” of all concerned citizens to demonstrate against the bill.The new law would bring France into line with many of its neighbours. In several countries including the UK, Spain and Belgium, such procedures are open to all women. French equality groups have fought for years against what they have called blatant “sexist” discrimination against single women and women in same-sex relationships.Macron himself has not spoken publicly on the issue since he became president in 2017, leaving it to the prime minister and senior ministers to insist France is ready for the change.However, Macron last week told lawmakers from his party, La République En Marche, that the draft law was fraught with risk for the government. The president had repeatedly delayed introducing the legislation for the past two years for fear of mass protests by conservative campaigners.In 2013, the legalisation of same-sex marriage in France was unique among its European neighbours in sparking months of large street demonstrations, which saw violent clashes between far-right groups and riot police and led to a rise in homophobic attacks.This weekend, the ethics board of France’s National Academy of Medicine issued a report warning that “the deliberate conception of a child deprived of a father is not without risk for the child’s development”.Several government ministers shot back that this was wrong. Agnès Buzyn, the health minister, said it was false to claim there was a link between growing up in a single-parent family and being damaged.Jean-Louis Touraine, a lawmaker for Macron’s party and medical professor who has helped draw up the text, said: “All the children born in these conditions tell us how happy they are, how they haven’t suffered from any great lack.”Many in the rightwing party Les Républicains have opposed the bill. Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party has called for the issue to be put to a referendum.Xavier Breton, a lawmaker from Les Républicains, has accused the government of “denying the difference” between men and women.Much criticism has focused on the notion of single women becoming lone parents, with hospital psychologists telling a parliament commission that a woman raising a child alone could have a negative impact on the child. Other experts insist that a large number of women in France already raise families alone.Leftwing parties have all backed the bill, which analysts say could help Macron recover some lost support on the left after he pushed through a series of pro-business tax cuts in the first half of his five-year mandate, which saw critics label him the “president of the rich”.The draft legislation would also allow children conceived with donor sperm to learn the donor’s identity when they turn 18, ending the anonymity that donors in France have been guaranteed until now.For lesbian couples, the child’s birth certificate would state the names of the “mother and mother” instead of the “mother and father”.The law would also allow women in their mid-30s to freeze their eggs – a procedure currently available only to women undergoing treatment that could affect their fertility, such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy for cancer.The government has estimated that the bill would benefit around 2,000 women annually."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e14f8533a8c8782f7ea3802353e48e5f5459a312/0_352_5800_3480/master/5800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b56aa229f4f200610052fd1891bdd463","title":"woman discovers renaissance masterpiece in her kitchen","story":"Christ Mocked, by the 13th-century painter Cimabue, could be worth up to €6mAn early Renaissance masterpiece by the great Florentine painter Cimabue has been discovered in a kitchen in a town near Paris, art experts have said.Christ Mocked, by the 13th-century artist who taught Giotto, is estimated to be worth between €4m and €6m (£3.5m to £5.3m), according to the old masters specialists Turquin.They said the work was owned by a woman in the northern French town of Compiègne, who had it hanging between her kitchen and her sitting room. It was directly above a hotplate for cooking food.The painting is thought to be part of a large diptych dating from 1280 when Cimabue, also known as Cenni di Pepo, painted eight scenes depicting Christ’s passion and crucifixion.Two other scenes from the work hang in the National Gallery in London – The Virgin and Child with Two Angels – and the Frick Collection in New York (The Flagellation of Christ).The scene in the National Gallery was also lost for centuries, and found only when a British aristocrat was clearing his ancestral seat in Suffolk. It was given to the nation in 2000.The French painting’s owner thought it was just a rather old religious icon when she took it to her local auctioneers to be valued.Early Renaissance art was hugely influenced by Byzantine art, which is still produced in a similar style today on a background of gold paint.

Photograph: Justin LaneEPAThe move announced by the Taoiseach to ringfence future carbon tax revenues to directly fund climate actions and to support those worst affected by rising penalties for using fossil fuels is a big piece of the decarbonisation jigsaw.We are committed to increasing carbon tax to €80 per tonne of carbon by 2030. This will generate the billions of euros necessary to help transition the Irish economy, on top of some € 30 billion under the National Development Plan. Given the mammoth task ahead, no one contended the revenues should go into the general pool of exchequer funds.The other option was a “fee and idend” given back to households, as advocated by the Green Party. It works in transforming human behaviour away from fossil fuel consumption. We as a small economy probably don’t have the luxury of such benevolence given the scale of decarbonisation that Ireland has to urgently pursue, though the Taoiseach flagged this option may still be possible in some form.In short, every cent will be needed to fund specific climate actions and to support those worst impacted – those in fuel poverty, and especially workers and farmers affected by the inevitable decline of old industry and a transformation in how we produce food.Addressing the emissions gapIreland is facing a huge challenge in having to arrest rising emissions, including dramatic reduction targets up to 2030 being demanded by the EU, while it has committed to an immensely demanding target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.The EU is now seeking even more ambition, notably a 55 per cent reduction of emissions by 2030 based on 1990 levels, which is an even bigger ask for Ireland. Significantly, the Government says it supports the EU’s wish for greater ambition under the Paris Agreement, but perhaps wisely has not committed to this given the scale of decarbonisation required to be undertaken by the country.All this, in any event, will entail a radical and costly overhaul of the entire economy and the whole of society the replacement of old industry and infrastructure with new industry and infrastructure built around renewable energy.Capacity gapsIn addition, Ireland is facing significant capacity gaps. This arises, firstly, in relation to the ability to generate energy, especially electricity, to serve a growing population and expanding economy, where demand from a large number of data centres will be very high.The scale of emerging ambition under the Government’s climate action plan will also place considerable pressures on the public service to deliver, backed by the right blend of expertise – again a considerable additional cost to decarbonisation.What now?The announcement by the Taoiseach at the UN Climate Action Summit provides clarity for key players. His announcement that Ireland is to end gas and oil exploration will provide stark indications to the fossil fuel sector of how the economy will pivot over coming decades.The next piece of clarity will be provided by the Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe, on how much carbon tax will increase by in the next budget. That is likely to be a hike of at least €10 per tonne, providing a timely boost to climate action coffers."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4028134.1569273354!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland to be among first countries to phase out oil and gas exploration","story":"Addressing the UN Climate Action Summit, an Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that Ireland is to phase out oil exploration as it is incompatible with a low carbon future.

Photograph: Johannes EiseleGetty Ireland’s decision to end fossil fuel exploration which was announced by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at the UN climate summit means the Republic is among the first countries in the world to get out of oil and gas production.The move is on foot of scientific advice about its climate impact. But the search for, and extraction of, gas will be permitted for some time as the country shifts to a carbon-free economy.Mr Varadkar said the Government agreed with advice from the Climate Change Advisory Council that exploration for oil should end “as it is incompatible with a low carbon future”, he told the summit on Monday.Some 60 global leaders, including Mr Varadkar, outlined hundreds of climate actions with a view to honouring previous commitments made under the Paris Agreement and to scaling climate ambition, as requested by UN Secretary General António Guterres. The most remarkable input, however, was from young climate activist Greta Thunberg. She scolded leaders for robbing young people of a future by focusing on “money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth”.The implications of Mr Varadkar’s exploration announcement was confirmed last night by a spokeswoman for the Taoiseach. Existing licences and options for oil and gas will remain valid but Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton will bring a memo to Government within a month to set out how the change will be implemented. “This will relate to future applications,” she said.No new licensing round for the Atlantic “closed” area – 80 per cent of our waters – will be brought forward by the Government. This is the area where most of the exploration is now focused. Some in the offshore sector queried the distinction being made between fossil fuel types because when carrying out exploration gas and oil are usually found together, with the gas coming up first. The Irish Offshore Operators’ Association said it will be seeking clarity on the revised arrangements. It said it remained committed to Ireland’s efforts to transition to renewable energy, “however energy security for Ireland is an important part of that process”.‘Important signal’Environmental and development organisations including the Green Party welcomed the announcement but warned that reliance on gas could not be justified and contradicted what the best climate science is saying.Friends of the Earth director Oisín Coghlan said the Taoiseach had sent “an important signal to investors that Ireland accepts the majority of fossil fuels have to stay in the ground if we are to contain climate change. However, Ireland is still running the risk of carbon lock-in by not phasing out gas exploration now also.” Meanwhile, it was confirmed that Mr Varadkar is to meet British prime minister Boris Johnson on the fringes of the UN General Assembly which opens on Tuesday. Speaking at a briefing, he warned that Ireland “cannot accept some kind of halfway house” on Brexit.“The position we’ve had all along is that we’re willing to examine alternative arrangements that achieve the same objectives as the backstop, objectives we’ve agreed to,” he said. However, he said, so far the proposals had fallen “very far short of that”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4028575.1569311878!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"climate summit government goes green in new york","story":"Addressing the UN Climate Action Summit, an Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that Ireland is to phase out oil exploration as it is incompatible with a low carbon future.

The standards and the professionalism are so high.”Similarly, Bodyguard “drove everybody round here absolutely up the wall”, Ms Dick said. “I actually did have to switch it off after about 20 minutes - the moment when the Home Secretary made a pass at the protection officer was just beyond me, I’m afraid.“But both series actually made us look a bit cool and interesting - a net positive, probably. They bring in interest and applications. Even though it’s all completely ludicrous.”She spoke to Radio Times to promote a new series of the BBC One documentary, The Met: Policing London.Explaining why she had allowed cameras to film her officers, Ms Dick said it was one of her priorities “to improve further confidence in the police, and I do believe that the more people know, the better it is.

She\u0027s been helpful and said she\u0027ll put us at the top of the list, she said.\u0026nbspThomas Cook staff have been really helpful but it\u0027s the people from above who aren\u0027t telling people what to do.\u0026nbspWeWork\u0027s biggest investor seeks to oust controversial CEO Neumann\u0026nbspAdam Neumann\u0027s time in charge of WeWork could be drawing to a close as the firm\u0027s biggest investor reportedly draws up plans to oust him.\u0026nbspWeWork\u0027s much-hyped stock market flotation was put on hold earlier this month after receiving little interest from investors worried about an inflated price, questionable business model and unusual corporate governance arrangements.\u0026nbspJapan\u0027s SoftBank, is now looking for ways to get rid of Neumann, Reuters reported, citing\u0026nbspfour people familiar with the matter.Softbank ploughed millions into WeWork at a sky-high valuation of $47bn in January.

Many analysts will use this as justification for evidence that the manufacturing recession is spreading into the rest of the economy, but the problem is that the services PMI is an unreliable indicator for such a shift.\u0026nbspIt often exhibits large swings for no reason whatsoever. That said, we don’t want to stand in the way of the main story here. These headlines are ugly, and more-or-less confirm that the German economy entered recession in Q2 and Q3. Uncertainty over global trade, and the tariff stand-off between China and the US, are now driving a deterioration in German manufacturing, which is as bad as during the 2008 crash.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMike Ashley in yet another takeover bid\u0026nbspMike Ashley appears to have an insatiable appetite for takeover deals - despite swoops for House of Fraser, Evans Cycles and Sofa, as well as interest in HMV and Patisserie Valerie, the retail mogul has launched a big for Goals Soccer Centres.\u0026nbspSports Direct, the jewel in the crown of Ashley\u0027s ever-expanding retail empire, revealed today that it put forward a 5p-a-share approach for Goals\u0026nbspon 5 September.\u0026nbspSports Direct already owns 18.9 per cent of Goals, which recently uncovered improper behaviour with its accounts dating back to 2010.\u0026nbspGoals has not yet allowed Sports Direct to look at its books.Thomas Cook collapse latest\u0026nbspJulie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor (a firm which specialises in corporate restructuring), has commented on today\u0027s news.\u0026nbspMs Palmer noted that a number of factors contributed to the collapse, such as Brexit and the rise of online bookings, but said the company\u0027s management strategy\u0026nbspcould have played a role in its demise.\u0026nbspShe said:\u0026nbsp“Questions do have to be asked of the management’s strategy. Other competitors, such as Tui, have faced similar issues yet have weathered this storm and developed a more compelling product offering.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Unfortunately, the Thomas Cook model was heavily based on a legacy model of high street travel agencies combined with a lacklustre online offering.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“But whatever the reasons for Thomas Cook’s demise, the UK travel industry will be reeling for some time with the loss of one of its most respected and historic names.”\u0026nbspTo follow all the latest updates on Thomas Cook\u0027s collapse, head over to our dedicated live blog:\u0026nbspLabour pledges 32-hour working week\u0026nbspThe UK would move from being one of Europe\u0027s most overworked nations to being one with the most leisure time, under plans unveiled by shadow chancellor John McDonnell.\u0026nbspHe told the Labour Party conference that, if elected, his party would reduce the average full-time working week to 32 hours with no loss of pay within a decade.\u0026nbspA new Working Time Commission would be handed the power to recommend increases in annual statutory leave requirements while a Real Living Wage of at least £10 an hour would be introduced.\u0026nbsp“We should work to live, not live to work,”\u0026nbspMr McDonnell said.\u0026nbspLabour would also restore powers to trade unions on day one, he added.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s political editor Andrew Woodcock has the full story:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLabour commits to 32-hour working week within a decade\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLabour’s embrace of Universal Basic Services “can renew social contract”, say academics\u0026nbspLabour\u0027s latest plans for the economy show a clear commitment to enhancing the living standards of millions in an increasingly insecure economic climate, say a group of experts at the Institute for Global Prosperity at University College London.\u0026nbspThe academics and economists praised John McDonnell\u0027s pledges to massively expand the provision of social housing\u0026nbspfree bus travel, meal provision for those most at risk of food insecurity and basic phone and internet access.\u0026nbspThey said the cost of the policy - around £42bn - could be entirely funded through changes to the Personal Allowance on income tax.\u0026nbspProfessor Henrietta Moore, Director of the UCL Institute for Global Prosperity, said:Adopting the Institute for Global Prosperity’s vision for Universal Basic Services as policy represents a major step forward in renewing the social contract in the UK. It shows a clear commitment to enhancing the living standards of millions in an increasingly insecure economic climate.Our ideas around UBS were developed in response to the changing realities of the modern economy. The livelihoods and life chances of millions of people are coming under increasing threat from rising costs for housing, food and other essentials. At the same time, too many are faced with insecure work, low pay and the prospect that their jobs and whole industries could disappear due to automation and technological change. Simply carrying on as we have before will not alter these trends.UBS provides an affordable way for us to meet these challenges, providing an enhanced safety net that can simultaneously provide the foundations for full participation in our economy and stem the rampant inequality that’s eating away at our society. To operate effectively, we have outlined how it must go hand-in-hand with democratic accountability at local level. UBS must be an expression of our shared social needs, with communities themselves in control.Billions of euros in revenues supporting millions of jobs are at risk from the “seismic” impact of a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit, Europe’s car makers have said.As the UK hurtles towards the 31 October Brexit deadline with little sign of a new deal, bodies representing the industry united to issue a joint plea to avert a no-deal. Such an outcome, they said, would have an “immediate and devastating” impact on one of the continent’s most successful sectors and employer for 13.8 million people across the EU.“The UK’s departure from the EU without a deal would trigger a seismic shift in trading conditions, with billions of euros of tariffs threatening to impact consumer choice and affordability on both sides of the Channel,” a group of 21 national trade associations, along with a number of Europe-wide bodies, wrote in a statement today.No-deal Brexit will have \u0027seismic\u0027 effect on millions of car industry jobs, say manufacturers\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThomas Cook is no more – what now for its 21,000 staff?\u0026nbspThe collapse of Thomas Cook has left over 150,000 holidaymakers currently abroad facing a premature end to their holiday.

Many analysts will use this as justification for evidence that the manufacturing recession is spreading into the rest of the economy, but the problem is that the services PMI is an unreliable indicator for such a shift.\u0026nbspIt often exhibits large swings for no reason whatsoever. That said, we don’t want to stand in the way of the main story here. These headlines are ugly, and more-or-less confirm that the German economy entered recession in Q2 and Q3.

It shows a clear commitment to enhancing the living standards of millions in an increasingly insecure economic climate.Our ideas around UBS were developed in response to the changing realities of the modern economy. The livelihoods and life chances of millions of people are coming under increasing threat from rising costs for housing, food and other essentials. At the same time, too many are faced with insecure work, low pay and the prospect that their jobs and whole industries could disappear due to automation and technological change. Simply carrying on as we have before will not alter these trends.UBS provides an affordable way for us to meet these challenges, providing an enhanced safety net that can simultaneously provide the foundations for full participation in our economy and stem the rampant inequality that’s eating away at our society. To operate effectively, we have outlined how it must go hand-in-hand with democratic accountability at local level. UBS must be an expression of our shared social needs, with communities themselves in control.Billions of euros in revenues supporting millions of jobs are at risk from the “seismic” impact of a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit, Europe’s car makers have said.As the UK hurtles towards the 31 October Brexit deadline with little sign of a new deal, bodies representing the industry united to issue a joint plea to avert a no-deal.

Instead, Labour needs to make sure that private schools are not an attractive option for parents when compared to a brilliant system of state education.”However, shadow chancellor John McDonnell argued scrapping private school fees could boost the economy.He told BBC Radio 5Live: “What I think we’ll find is that for the large number of people who would be, at the moment, spending money on private education, that money actually will go into the wider economy and stimulate the economy.”Both the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and Mr Corbyn attended private schools.On Sunday, Mr Corbyn tweeted: “Every child deserves to get the very best education, no matter their background. A Labour government will end the privilege that is entrenched by private schools.”Mr Johnson has criticised Labour’s plans to abolish private schools as being both expensive and “pointless”.The Eton-educated prime minister has said it would cost £7bn of taxpayers’ money to educate all the pupils who would no longer be educated privately.He also accused Mr Corbyn of “unbelievable hypocrisy” over the proposal, highlighting that the Labour leader, as well children of several Labour cabinet ministers, attended a private school.“It’s extraordinary that they’ve excavated this from the crypt of what I thought to be long buried socialist ideology,” Mr Johnson said.\u0026nbspAsked if he thinks he would be PM if he had not been privately educated, Mr Johnson replied: “I’ve been very fortunate in my life in all sorts of ways and I certainly owe a lot to my education.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

These qubits make use of a quantum phenomena known as superposition, meaning they exist in two states at once.The ability to act as both a ‘one’ and a ‘zero’ at the same time,\u0026nbspquantum computing systems are theoretically able to be exponentially more powerful than classical computers with every qubit added.This exponential rate was called into question earlier this year by computer scientists at Google’s quantum computing lab, who observed that their systems were gaining power at a “doubly exponential” rate.IBM plans computers millions of times faster than any beforeHarmut Neven, director of Google’s Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab, told\u0026nbspQuanta\u0026nbspmagazine in June that their most advanced quantum processor was improving at a rate far beyond what they thought was theoretically possible.Mr Neven said that such a rate of development was almost unfathomable, as there is nothing that grows that quickly in the natural world with which to draw a comparison.“It looks like nothing is happening, nothing is happening, and then whoops, suddenly you’re in a different world,” he said.The Independent\u0026nbsphas reached out to Google for comment on the leaked research paper.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Italian researchers found women living in the most polluted areas were three times more likely to show signs they were running low on eggs than those who lived in cleaner surroundings, potentially triggering an earlier menopause347 Two hours a week spent in nature can improve healthA study in the journal Scientific Reports suggests that a dose of nature of just two hours a week is associated with better health and psychological wellbeing447 Junk food ads could be banned before watershedJunk food adverts on TV and online could be banned before 9pm as part of Government plans to fight the epidemic of childhood obesity.547 Breeding with neanderthals helped humans fight diseasesOn migrating from Africa around 70,000 years ago, humans bumped into the neanderthals of Eurasia. While humans were weak to the diseases of the new lands, breeding with the resident neanderthals made for a better equipped immune system647 Cancer breath test to be trialled in BritainThe breath biopsy device is designed to detect cancer hallmarks in molecules exhaled by patients747 Average 10 year old has consumed the recommended amount of sugar for an adult By their 10th birthdy, children have on average already eaten more sugar than the recommended amount for an 18 year old. The average 10 year old consumes the equivalent to 13 sugar cubes a day, 8 more than is recommendedWhile there is not enough evidence of harm to recommend UK-wide limits on screen use, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health have advised that children should avoid screens for an hour before bed time to avoid disrupting their sleep947 Daily aspirin is unnecessary for older people in good health, study findsA study published in the New England Journal of Medicine has found that many elderly people are taking daily aspirin to little or no avail1047 Vaping could lead to cancer, US study findsA study by the University of Minnesota\u0027s Masonic Cancer Centre has found that the carcinogenic chemicals formaldehyde, acrolein, and methylglyoxal are present in the saliva of E-cigarette users1147 More children are obese and diabetic1247 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide1347 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugar1447 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active1647 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.1747 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.1847 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms. Melissa Whiteley, an 18-year-old engineering student from Hanford in Stoke-on-Trent, fell ill at Christmas and died in hospital a month later.1947 Government to review thousands of harmful vaginal mesh implantsThe Government has pledged to review tens of thousands of cases where women have been given harmful vaginal mesh implants.2047 Jeremy Hunt announces \u0027zero suicides ambition\u0027 for the NHSThe NHS will be asked to go further to prevent the deaths of patients in its care as part of a “zero suicide ambition” being launched today.2147 Human trials start with cancer treatment that primes immune system to kill off tumoursHuman trials have begun with a new cancer therapy that can prime the immune system to eradicate tumours. The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 2247 Babies\u0027 health suffers from being born near fracking sites, finds major studyMothers living within a kilometre of a fracking site were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born at low birth weight, which increase their chances of asthma, ADHD and other issues2347 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.2447 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.2547 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data. Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.2647 Cannabis extract could provide ‘new class of treatment’ for psychosisCBD has a broadly opposite effect to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component  in cannabis and the substance that causes paranoia and anxiety.2747 Over 75,000 sign petition calling for Richard Branson\u0027s Virgin Care to hand settlement money back to NHSMr Branson’s company sued the NHS last year after it lost out on an £82m contract to provide children’s health services across Surrey, citing concerns over “serious flaws” in the way the contract was awarded2847 More than 700 fewer nurses training in England in first year after NHS bursary scrappedThe numbers of people accepted to study nursing in England fell 3 per cent in 2017, while the numbers accepted in Wales and Scotland, where the bursaries were kept, increased 8.4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively2947 Landmark study links Tory austerity to 120,000 deathsThe paper found that there were 45,000 more deaths in the first four years of Tory-led efficiencies than would have been expected if funding had stayed at pre-election levels.Hours of commuting may be mind-numbingly dull, but new research shows that it might also be having an adverse effect on both your health and performance at work.  Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression3147 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part3447 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.3547 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves3647 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.3747 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.3847 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed3947 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.4047 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.4147 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.4247 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.4347 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.4447 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4547 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4647 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4747 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 147 Baldness cure looks to be a step closerResearchers in the US claim to have overcome one of the major hurdles to cultivating human follicles from stem cells.

The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.3747 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.3847 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed3947 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.4047 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.4147 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.4247 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.4347 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.4447 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4547 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4647 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4747 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. Around 31 per cent of vapers said they were former smokers who used the products to quit cigarettes.“Vaping\u0026nbspisn’t risk free, but it’s much less risky than smoking, which kills nearly 100,000 people a year in the UK,” said Ann McNeill, professor of tobacco addiction at King’s College London.\u0026nbspA further 20 per cent said they had successfully quit smoking but vaped\u0026nbspto prevent relapsing.In the US flavoured e-cigarettes have been linked to a mysterious lung illness which has killed at least eight people.At least 450\u0026nbspcases of the illness have been reported, according to health officials.Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Ash, said the reports from the US were “obviously concerning” but appeared to be linked to the misuse of e-cigarettes for illicit drug delivery.“Nothing like this has been seen in the UK to date, where a proper regulatory system is in place for nicotine containing e-cigarettes, which is not yet the case in the US,” she said.Mystery vaping-related illness kills man in eighth US deathWalmart to stop selling e-cigarettes after spate of vaping deaths“Vapers should not be scared back to smoking by the news of\u0026nbspvaping\u0026nbspillness in the US.“Nor should smokers stick to smoking rather than switch to\u0026nbspvaping. It is essential however, to only use legal vapes bought from reputable suppliers in the UK and not source illicit unregulated products over the internet.”14 per cent of the vapers polled\u0026nbspsaid they enjoyed using e-cigarettes, while 13 per cent said they used the products to save money.Only 0.8 per cent of the vapers\u0026nbsp had\u0026nbspnever smoked. Of that small number, the vast majority – 73 per cent – said they began vaping to give it a try.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The decision presumably came late in the phone\u0027s development, given the parts are still inside.The site reported that the extra connector in the battery appears to connect straight to the wireless charging coil in the back, and that it appeared to behave in a way that suggested it was watching to ensure it did not get too hot while charging up.The discovery has led some to speculate that Apple could turn on the feature at a later date, using a software update that would remotely activate it. But Apple may choose not to mention the feature at all, or only bring it to future devices.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 467 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.567 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1367 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1467 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1767 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2167 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2767 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2967 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3167 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3667 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4367 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4567 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track “Forgot That You Existed” is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. “Something magical happened one night,” she sings. “I forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t.” The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift’s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard)One could argue that there’s too much eclecticism here – that if this really is Crow’s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn’t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on “Flying Blind” – her steely determination on this record has you believing that she’ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5967 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6067 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.6167 Pixies – Beneath the EyrieTales of witchy curses (“On Graveyard Hill”) and spirit reincarnation (“Daniel Boone”) feel like they’ve been dug up from ancient folklore, and capture classic-Pixies menace and ghoulish spirit. Over the album’s 12 tracks, ghostly organs and minor-key guitar-picked sequences help to conjure this dark, Gothic vibe. Yet for all its darkness, Beneath the Eyrie is brimming with the kind of melody that we expect from these indie-rock giants from the late Eighties. “Ready for Love” is a melancholy ballad with harmonising vocals from bassist Paz Lenchantin (Kim Deal’s now-permanent replacement), while lead single “Catfish Kate” – a tale of a woman battling a catfish in a river told by Black Jack Hooligan – is a rock hit in waiting. (Elisa Bray)6267 Jenny Hval – The Practice of LoveThis endlessly fascinating artist’s seventh, full-length, album The Practice of Love is just as considered as 2016\u0027s Blood Bitch, examining one’s role in humankind and on Earth, and probing that favourite of pop-song themes: love. But where the 2017 Nordic Music Prize-winning Blood Bitch was packed with visceral imagery and disarming sonics, the themes of The Practice of Love are encased in a warm cocoon of poetry, blissed-out circling synths and trance-like Nineties beats. (Elisa Bray)This is nomy at their most ambitious and pleasurably weird. As with the dreamy “Upset My Girlfriend”, which speaks of a man about to propose to his partner despite the fight they’re in, it’s an album stranded somewhere between pure joy and unexplainable sadness like slapping on a false smile despite feeling miserable, and recognising how much it helps in the moment. (Adam White)Listening on headphones, I was reminded of the late French designer Janet Laverriere. Born in 1909, she was still a powerful, playful force when I interviewed her for this paper in her eighties. She banged a cast iron radiator with a spoon to celebrate the echoes and curves of essential pipework: “I put all the hard plumbing on the outside. In kitchens, in bathrooms, I am feminist, evidemment!”Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Why Me? Why Not. is enjoyably defiant, Gallagher embodying a settled and contented aura. “Gotta live for something besides yesterdays,” Gallagher snarls on “Be Still”. The downbeat “Once” forgoes easy Noel-bashing for a mournful glance at the years when the pair were still speaking (“I remember how you used to shine back then... but you only get to do it once”). And “Now That I’ve Found You” is even somewhat sickly-sweet in tone, a cheery tribute to his daughter Molly, whom he met for the first time when she was 21. “I know it’s late for lullabies, but the future is yours and mine,” he sings, alongside upbeat whoops and Radio 2-friendly guitars.The album takes a deep, contemplative breath on “Short and Sweet”, which is exactly what it promises, a Grace Jones-like ballad on which Howard’s voice takes precedent over inconspicuous guitar, and the background hisses like an old vinyl. On “He Loves Me”, she grapples with maintaining a relationship with God when she’s long since stopped going to church.  It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 467 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.567 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1367 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1467 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1767 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2167 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2767 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2967 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3167 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3667 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4367 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4567 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track “Forgot That You Existed” is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. “Something magical happened one night,” she sings. “I forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t.” The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift’s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard)One could argue that there’s too much eclecticism here – that if this really is Crow’s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn’t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on “Flying Blind” – her steely determination on this record has you believing that she’ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5967 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6067 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.6167 Pixies – Beneath the EyrieTales of witchy curses (“On Graveyard Hill”) and spirit reincarnation (“Daniel Boone”) feel like they’ve been dug up from ancient folklore, and capture classic-Pixies menace and ghoulish spirit. Over the album’s 12 tracks, ghostly organs and minor-key guitar-picked sequences help to conjure this dark, Gothic vibe. Yet for all its darkness, Beneath the Eyrie is brimming with the kind of melody that we expect from these indie-rock giants from the late Eighties. “Ready for Love” is a melancholy ballad with harmonising vocals from bassist Paz Lenchantin (Kim Deal’s now-permanent replacement), while lead single “Catfish Kate” – a tale of a woman battling a catfish in a river told by Black Jack Hooligan – is a rock hit in waiting. (Elisa Bray)6267 Jenny Hval – The Practice of LoveThis endlessly fascinating artist’s seventh, full-length, album The Practice of Love is just as considered as 2016\u0027s Blood Bitch, examining one’s role in humankind and on Earth, and probing that favourite of pop-song themes: love. But where the 2017 Nordic Music Prize-winning Blood Bitch was packed with visceral imagery and disarming sonics, the themes of The Practice of Love are encased in a warm cocoon of poetry, blissed-out circling synths and trance-like Nineties beats. (Elisa Bray)This is nomy at their most ambitious and pleasurably weird. As with the dreamy “Upset My Girlfriend”, which speaks of a man about to propose to his partner despite the fight they’re in, it’s an album stranded somewhere between pure joy and unexplainable sadness like slapping on a false smile despite feeling miserable, and recognising how much it helps in the moment. (Adam White)Listening on headphones, I was reminded of the late French designer Janet Laverriere. Born in 1909, she was still a powerful, playful force when I interviewed her for this paper in her eighties. She banged a cast iron radiator with a spoon to celebrate the echoes and curves of essential pipework: “I put all the hard plumbing on the outside. In kitchens, in bathrooms, I am feminist, evidemment!”Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Why Me? Why Not. is enjoyably defiant, Gallagher embodying a settled and contented aura. “Gotta live for something besides yesterdays,” Gallagher snarls on “Be Still”. The downbeat “Once” forgoes easy Noel-bashing for a mournful glance at the years when the pair were still speaking (“I remember how you used to shine back then... but you only get to do it once”). And “Now That I’ve Found You” is even somewhat sickly-sweet in tone, a cheery tribute to his daughter Molly, whom he met for the first time when she was 21. “I know it’s late for lullabies, but the future is yours and mine,” he sings, alongside upbeat whoops and Radio 2-friendly guitars.The album takes a deep, contemplative breath on “Short and Sweet”, which is exactly what it promises, a Grace Jones-like ballad on which Howard’s voice takes precedent over inconspicuous guitar, and the background hisses like an old vinyl. On “He Loves Me”, she grapples with maintaining a relationship with God when she’s long since stopped going to church.  West performed with a choir of 80 singers flown from California to Wyoming on Sunday morning.The music included 14 choir pieces focused on worship and nontraditional hymns, as well as reworked versions of songs by No Doubt and Nirvana.West recently purchased a ranch property south of Cody.He\u0027s expected to release his new album,\u0026nbspJesus is King, on 22 September.\u0026nbspHis most recent studio album\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspYe, which debuted in June last year.Additional reporting by agenciesThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateThis would result in higher car prices for consumers because manufacturers will not be able to absorb all of the extra costs, the group said.The car industry is one of the most deeply integrated across Europe, meaning it faces some of the biggest disruptions of any sector as companies with sites in the UK are forced to adapt to the new reality of tariffs and delays caused by border checks and additional administrative tasks.Across the EU, one in 16 of the workforce is employed in the car industry, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association.

By simulating all the variables, town planners would be able to figure out ways to eliminate traffic congestion and pollution issues – or at least understand them better.But if they could simulate entire cities, then why not entire universes? This was the question posed by MIT professor Seth Lloyd, who suggested that the world we exist in is in fact a giant quantum computer.\u0026nbspBeyond theories that we are actually living inside\u0026nbspThe Matrix, this ability to perform complex simulations could eventually see quantum computers simulate the beginnings of the universe and maybe one day answer some of science’s most puzzling questions.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The farmers in the region are really despairing. In the years before many faced floods, in 2018 it was scorching heat. Many grow crops that are meant to feed their cows, so when the crops fail they need to buy feed. With the price of milk so low many are fearing for their economic survival if weather cycles like this continue - Sean GallupOn the third day of the Camp Fire the flames had moved away from the town and were burning in the nearby hills.

But Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon denounced it as an “abdication of responsibility”, while Conservative chair\u0026nbspJames Cleverly said it showed Labour was offering only “more talk, more indecision and more pointless delay”.There was anger after the crucial vote, which took place amid chaotic scenes at the Brighton gathering, as disputes broke out over whether the vote by a show of hands had been passed or not.\u0026nbspNational Executive Committee official Wendy Nichols, who was chairing the session, admitted she had initially thought the vote was in favour of Remain, but was told by general secretary Jennie Formby that delegates had in fact voted against. She resisted angry demands for a card vote to get a precise measure of the balance of opinion.Under rule changes agreed last year and implemented at this conference, delegates no longer have the right to demand a card vote, which is instead at the discretion of the chair.Created with Sketch.Brexit and climate protests at Labour party conference: In pictures Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn walks past anti-Brexit campaigner on the second day of the party conference in BrightonA protester holds a sign mocking Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s Brexit stance at the party conference in BrightonActivists from anti-climate change movement Extinction Rebellion march on the Labour conference in BrightonDelegates take part in an informal vote on Labour\u0027s Brexitr stance at the party conference in BrightonShadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry leads a march in support of a second referendum on BrexitAnti-Brexit protesters take part in a People\u0027s Vote rally during the Labour party conference in BrightonExtinction RebelliActivists from anti-climate change movement Extinction Rebellion march on the Labour conference in BrightononExtinction Rebellion activists march on the Labour conference in BrightonA delegate arrives carrying a briefing from the Labour Representation Committee to the Labour party conference in BrightonProminent anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray protests on Brighton beach during the Labour party conferenceAnti-Brexit protesters take part in a People\u0027s Vote rally during the Labour party conference in BrightonActivists raise a banner calling for the Labour party to restore the original Clause 4 of its constitution, which would pledge the party to nationalising all industryLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn walks past anti-Brexit campaigner on the second day of the party conference in BrightonA protester holds a sign mocking Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s Brexit stance at the party conference in BrightonActivists from anti-climate change movement Extinction Rebellion march on the Labour conference in BrightonDelegates take part in an informal vote on Labour\u0027s Brexitr stance at the party conference in BrightonShadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry leads a march in support of a second referendum on BrexitAnti-Brexit protesters take part in a People\u0027s Vote rally during the Labour party conference in BrightonExtinction RebelliActivists from anti-climate change movement Extinction Rebellion march on the Labour conference in BrightononExtinction Rebellion activists march on the Labour conference in BrightonA delegate arrives carrying a briefing from the Labour Representation Committee to the Labour party conference in BrightonProminent anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray protests on Brighton beach during the Labour party conferenceAnti-Brexit protesters take part in a People\u0027s Vote rally during the Labour party conference in BrightonActivists raise a banner calling for the Labour party to restore the original Clause 4 of its constitution, which would pledge the party to nationalising all industryOne Labour\u0026nbspRemainer\u0026nbspsaid: “It was the grassroots against the party machine and the machine won.”Remain-backers’ hopes were boosted earlier in the day when a string of trade unions, led by the country’s largest union Unison, came out in favour of a motion tabled by more than 80 constituency Labour parties, calling for the party to campaign “energetically” for continued EU membership in any referendum.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer left little doubt where his sympathies lay, telling delegates moments before the vote: “I have a very simple message today: if you want a referendum – Vote Labour. If you want a Final Say on Brexit – Vote Labour. If you want to fight for Remain – Vote Labour. Labour will let the people decide”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s what the Labour Party does.”Sir Keir said he would continue personally to campaign for Remain, and said that the NEC position represented “quite considerable movement” over the past 12 months.Mr Corbyn’s plan, approved by a show of hands, envisages a Labour government negotiating a “credible”\u0026nbspBrexit deal within three months of taking power, with the UK remaining in the EU’s customs union and maintaining a close single market relationship, while safeguarding European-style workplace, environmental and consumer protections.The plan commits Labour to a referendum within six months, but leaves the question of which side the party would take to be decided at a special conference after the election. Starmer announced that Labour would legislate to fix the date of the referendum\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp”immediately” after taking office.Following the vote, close Corbyn ally Ms Abbott said: “The message is –\u0026nbspdespite the chatter from commentators –\u0026nbspthe party is determined to unite behind its leader.”But Michael Chessum of the pro-EU Another Europe Is Possible group, which drafted the Remain motion, said:\u0026nbsp”Labour members, 90 per cent of whom want to stay in the EU, will be deeply disappointed with this decision. It is possible that the Remain motion had a majority in the constituency Labour parties, but because there was no card vote we will never know.”Mr Chessum said it was “not too late\u0026nbspfor Labour to make clear that it opposes Brexit outright”.“Though it is not the policy we supported, the calling of a special conference to democratically decide Labour’s Brexit policy was a concession which we won,” he said. “But a fudge is not a unity position. It is deeply isive among members, and risks losing a large chunk of our voter base.”Andrew Lewin, founder of Remain Labour, said “We were told the Labour Party would embrace democracy, but today it was the grassroots against the party machine – and the machine won.“If this fudge is the Labour policy at the next general election, we will drive Remain voters away. It simply isn’t viable to be ‘neutral’ on Brexit.”Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, whose own party committed to revoking Brexit at its conference last week, said:\u0026nbsp“Jeremy Corbyn has again shown a total lack of leadership on Brexit and settled on yet another fudge on the biggest issue facing our country. Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly had the opportunity to put the full force of the Labour behind a Remain position, but he has once again shown today that he is a Brexiteer at heart.”Ms Sturgeon tweeted: “Labour rejects a clear pro-Remain position and instead stays firmly perched on the Brexit fence... It beggars belief – from a practical and principled point of view – that Corbyn thinks he can go through a General Election without saying if he backs Remain or Leave. The SNP’s\u0026nbspposition is unequivocally Stop Brexit.”Labour’s mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: “I\u0026nbspdo not believe this decision reflects the views of the overwhelming majority of Labour members who desperately want to stop Brexit. Labour is\u0026nbspa Remain party. I will continue campaigning with London Labour to give the public the Final Say and stop Brexit.”Labour MP Ian Murray, a prominent campaigner for Remain,\u0026nbspsaid:\u0026nbsp“It’s important to recognise that we now have a policy of a public vote on any deal with the option to Remain. That’s really the only show in town.“But it is of course deeply disappointing that we have not chosen to campaign for Remain at this stage, as that certainly does not reflect the strong views of the overwhelming majority of our members and supporters.“It is simply not tenable for our leadership to be neutral when we face the biggest crisis our country has witnessed in modern times.”And Green MP Caroline Lucas said: “After the climate crisis, the biggest issue we face – and Labour refuses to take a side. At a time when we need a strong opposition more than ever, they’ve left the pitch. This is a tragedy for our politics and our country.”Mr\u0026nbspCleverly said: “Jeremy Corbyn and Labour have once again dodged making any decision on Brexit, proving yet again all they offer is more of the same – more talk, more indecision and more pointless delay.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Heres the latest on her ongoing ordeal.In August  it was revealed that tough new prison rules had been imposed on Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe. reported that she is no longer allowed to call her husband in the UK.The hours she can see her daughter Gabriella have also been restricted.Free Nazanin tweeted:New rules have been issued for Nazanin’s ward restricting children visits to only once a month as part of the wider family visit  preventing international calls.This means Gabriella can now only see Nazanin once a month  Nazanin can no longer speak to Richard.Nazanin has written to the authorities to protest the change. She told her family: I am so upset. I feel like I could suffocate. I can’t even think what to do. I haven’t cried so loud in the middle of the ward for ages. How cruel they are. How unjust this is.Boris Johnson PM was due to make renewed calls for Nazanins release when he meets Hassan Rouhani at a UN summit in New York.Mr Johnson told reporters: I will not only be discussing Irans actions in the region, but also the need to release not just Nazanin but others who in our view are being illegally and unfairly held in Tehran.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe is a British-Iranian mum, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation – the charitable arm of the news agency – and a former BBC employee.She was arrested in Tehrans Imam Khomeini airport on April , , and accused of plotting to topple the regime.Nazanin was stopped from ing home to Britain after visiting family with her daughter Gabriella, now four, and thrown into prison, where she spent months in solitary confinement.Her family says Iran’s Revolutionary Guard tried to get her to confess on camera that she trained and recruited spies - a charge she denied.In June  Jeremy Hunt issued his latest pleas in support of Nazanin, was she went on hunger strike.The Foreign Secretary told the Commons: Whatever disagreements you have with the UK, do not punish this innocent woman.Mr Hunt said that Mr Ratclfe, who was also on hunger strike outside the Iranian embassy, was a very brave man who was doing a remarkable job.Nazanin was convicted of plotting the soft toppling of the Iranian government and sentenced to five years behind bars in September .She was set to become eligible for early release in late  or early  but was hauled back to court and confronted with two new charges that could see  years added to her sentence.She was accused of joining and receiving money from organisations working to overthrow the Islamic Republic.Iran says Nazanin’s former employer, the BBC, is trying to topple the Islamic theocracy.The dual national is also accused of protesting outside the Iranian embassy in London.On August , , she was given a three-day release from prison to visit her daughter - who is staying with an Iranian family.Fears had been growing for her mental wellbeing, as reports claimed Nazanin was suicidal as she awaited a round of sentencing.The mum is just one of several dual nationals held in Iran on espionage charges, likely to be used as bargaining chips in future negotiations with the West.A UN  of experts described the practice as part of an emerging pattern since the  Iran nuclear deal.On May , , she was dealt a fresh blow when an Iranian judge told her to expect another conviction after appearing in court over a new invented charge.On December , , Nazanins husband Richard joined Mayor of London Sadiq Khan to brand her incarceration in Iran on spying charges a travesty of justice.Campaigners have launched a fresh bid to free the British mum.Foreign Office minister Andrew Murrison pressed Iran for the urgent and unconditional release of the British mum during a trip to Iran.But Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman, Abbas Mousavi said: Mrs Zaghari is an Iranian. She has been convicted on security charges and is spending her sentence in prison.Her dual nationality is not recognised by Iranian laws.A ray of hope emerged before Christmas  after Nazanin was told she was eligible for early release.Nazanins lawyer told the -year-old that her case was marked on the Iranian judiciary database as eligible for early release.However, nothing came of the matter and she was stuck in the prison.In August  she was given a three-day release from jail to visit her daughter.Emotional pictures released by the family showed smiling Nazanin hugging her daughter Gabriella as they were reunited.She spent time with her family in Damavand, a town north east of Tehran.The Free Nazanin campaign claimed Evin prison guards told her she had just ten minutes to get ready before leaving.It added that she dressed and packed quickly as her cellmates gathered round.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe was hauled back into prison on August .The -year-old had spent three days with four-year-old Gabriella and was hoping to get an extension to her temporary release.However, despite promises from prosecutors that her furlough from jail would be extended, hours later she was back behind bars.Speaking of the moment she was told to go back to prison, her husband Richard Ratclfe said: Nazanin waited for Gabriella to wake up before saying goodbye, and left her family home toto Evin prison.She promised Gabriella that the next time she saw her it would be forever not just for a few days, for proper freedom, not just for furlough. And next time they will go back to London to be with daddy.Nazanin decided to go into the prison voluntarily rather than be dragged out of the house in front of Gabriella when the Iranian authorities refused to prolong her release.Nazanin’s husband Richard Ratclfe, an accountant who lives in North London, was not with her when she was arrested, and has been campaigning for her release ever since.He called on the Government to do more to secure his we’s freedom and set up a petition last year demanding action.Richard blasted the latest charges by Iran, dismissing them as “games” that make the country “look foolish” and bring its legal system into disrepute.In , Boris Johnson was accused of making the situation worse by telling MPs Nazanin was teaching journalism when she went on holiday in Iran - a statement her family and her employer said was untrue.Three days after Johnsons statement to a parliamentary committee, Nazanin was summoned before an unscheduled court hearing, where the foreign secretarys comments were cited as proof she was engaged in propaganda against the regime.Johnson admitted he feels a deep sense of anguish of the fate of jailed mum Nazanin.But NoJo again denied that he is responsible for the fact shes languishing in an Iranian prison.The couples daughter Gabriella is being cared for in Tehran by her grandparents after the tots passport was initially confiscated.On August , , an Iranian journalist tweeted that the British mum had been hospitalised.Ershad Alijani, who works for France, tweeted: Nazanin Zaghari, after an anxiety attack in the prison,transferred to hospital,according her friends in the prison, she was not able to move her arms and legs and finally fainted.And her husband Richard Ratclfe told : She definitely had two panic attacks ... and passed out.She was definitely transferred to the prison clinic. I have not had it confirmed she has been sent to an external hospital yet.On December , , it was reported she had been denied a doctor visit despite finding lumps in her breast.The British mum went on a hunger strike in her Iranian prison cell after being denied access to medical care  after finding lumps in her breast, however they have now ended their strike.Her husband Richard claims she is also in constant pain due to an undiagnosed neurological condition and needs a mammogram and MRI scan, but prison officers have allegedly refused to let her see a doctor.In protest of the refusals for medical help, Nazanin went on a hunger strike in her cell at Tehrans Evin prison.She announced her decision in a joint letter with a fellow prisoner, the human rights activist Narges Mohammadi.The women said they have planned an initial three-day hunger strike, which was going to be extended until their demands are met.Richard and Nazanin went on hunger strike again in June .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was eating our chickens and rabbits.Name: Champ ChampyLocation: Lake Champlain, USA and CanadaAppearance: Massive water snakeNessie isnt the only lake-based monster to capture the imagination of terried locals.Champ or Champy is a giant monster said to swim beneath the surface of Lake Champlain, which is split between New York, Vermont and Quebec.Over  sightings have been made of Champ, with the first recorded in .A sailor named Captain Crum said he saw an enormous serpentine monster which he reckoned to be around  feet long with three teeth and eyes the colour of peeled onions.He added that the creature had a belt of red around its neck and a white star on its forehead.P.T. Barnum, the historical figure played by Hugh Jackman in The Greatest Showman, even offered a reward to whoever brought him the monster.Interest in the lake snake exploded in  when Sandra Mansi snapped a picture of a huge creature sticking out of the water, and dozens of other images supposedly of Champ have been captured since.In , an article was published in a peer-reviewed scientic journal describing the discovery of sound measurements in the lake consistent with killer and beluga whales — neither of which are known to live in Lake Champlain.Name: Underwater panther MishipeshuLocation: Michipicoten Island and Great Lakes, CanadaAppearance: Scaly lynx with a spiked spineThe underwater panther or Mishipeshu is one of the most important mythical beings to the indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands around the Great Lakes in the USA and Canada.It has the head and claws of a giant Lynx-like cat, but has scales all over its body and has sharp spikes along its tail and back.The underwater panther is known for guarding huge copper reserves in the Great Lakes, with the copper on Michipicoten Island considered especially sacred property of the beast.A seventeenth century missionary called Claude Dablon told a tale of four Ojibwe people all being ripped apart by the underwater panther for taking its precious metal.Name: RompoLocation: Africa and IndiaAppearance: Skeletal body with the arms of a badger and the legs of a bearRompo is one of the strangest mythical creatures reported anywhere in the world.Its thought to have the head of a hare but with human ears on top a of a skeleton-like body, dragging itself around with the arms of a badger and the legs of a bear.Most disturbing of all, it only feeds on human corpses, making a soft low noise as it does so.When it finds a body, witnesses claim it circles the dead person several times before it begins feasting.Its also claimed that the Rompos skin changes colour, turning green when it moves among bushes and trees.Although sceptics think the Rompo is actually an old world porcupine, encounters with the beast have been logged in both India and across Africa.Name: Jersey Devil Leeds DevilLocation: New Jersey, USAAppearance: Goat-headed flying beast with hooves and the wings of a batThe Jersey Devil or Leeds Devil is a terrying bat-winged kangeroo-like creature with the head of a goat and cloven hooves.Its said that the devil moves quickly and cries with a high-pitched blood-curdling scream.The legend of the Jersey Devil began in , when New Jersey resident Jane Leeds cursed the baby in her womb when she found out she was pregnant for the thirteenth time.Then, on the stormy night when the child was born, it changed rapidly from a normal baby into a nightmare creature with a forked tail.Witnesses present at the horric event claimed the devil child screamed and growled before flying up the chimney and off into the woods.And then  years later, in , hundreds of sightings were reported in local newspapers about sightings and attacks of the Jersey Devil.Cops say they shot at it without effect and schools were closed in the Delaware Valley because of the widespread fear and panic.At the time, vigilante groups even took up arms to rid their communities of the beast.The fearsome legend lives on in the terrying -storey Jersey Devil rollercoaster set to open at Six Flags in New Jersey next year."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn labour brexit policy fence sitting","story":"He said a Labour government would seek to negotiate a dferent deal with the EU then put that and Remain to the country in a second referendum.And which side would Corbyn be on  Well, he’ll get back to you on that. Corbyn hasn’t committed to either side. In an interview yesterday, he refused to answer the question EIGHT TIMES.So, we are in the absurd position of a man running to be Prime Minister not being able to say where he would stand on the biggest issue facing the country in decades.Little wonder that more than three quarters of voters are dissatisfied with his performance.Corbyn is betting that he can quarantine the issue of Brexit. His strategy is to offer a second referendum then fight a general election on classic Left Right lines.The problem with this plan is that British politics is so dominated by Brexit that you HAVE to have an answer on that before you can talk about anything .Is Jeremy Corbyn really intending to spend the entire election campaign refusing to say how he would vote in the referendum he is calling for Corbyn’s equivocation is a particular problem, given the clarity in the other parties’ positions.The Lib Dem conference agreed this week thatthe party won a majority in a general election — stop sniggering at the back — they would simply revoke Article .This clear policy is helping them scoop up more and more Remainer votes. One poll this week had them overtaking Labour and pulling in support from more than  per cent of those who backed Remain in .If the Lib Dems get anywhere near this level of support in a general election, then Labour will lose seats to BOTH the Lib Dems and the Tories.As one gleeful Cabinet minister points out, the Lib Dem position “shines a spot-light on Labour’s ambiguity”.Many in the Shadow Cabinet are worried about Corbyn’s refusal to say where he stands. Many of them want Labour to state clearly that it is the party of Remain.Expect an effort at next week’s Labour conference to change the party’s position to make it clear that as a party Labour WILL IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES campaign for Remain in a second referendum.The other problem with Corbyn’s position is that it means this whole debate will just drag on. Another negotiation with Brussels followed by another referendum would take at least six months, and maybe more.This isn’t going to be popular with an electorate that wants this issue resolved so the country can move on and start addressing the domestic issues voters care about most.At the last election, Corbyn managed to skilfully straddle the Brexit ide.He hoovered up the votes of Remainers but with a manesto that promised to respect the referendum result, held on to heavily Leave-supporting seats too.It will be far harder,not impossible, for Corbyn to pull off that trick again. The danger for him is that his fence-sitting ends up alienating both groups.AT his book launch, David Cameron told the assembled guests that he had tried to avoid writing too much about scandals in the memoir.But he did remember when a Tory peer got caught up in an SM sting early in his leadership.It was put to him that he should remove the whip, to which Cameron replied: “Shouldn’t we take the handcuffs off too ”“WHAT was he thinking ’ one loyal, long-time supporter of David Cameron declared to me after the former PM revealed how he had worked behind the scenes to get the Queen to make an intervention in the Scottish independence referendum.The Palace is understandably cross about the revelation, which undermines the Queen’s political neutrality.One Whitehall source tells me the Palace are “apoplectic” about it and can’t understand why a former Prime Minister would break such an important confidence in such a pre-meditated way.Belatedly, Cameron seems to have realised the trouble he’s caused – refusing to answer further questions on it for TV.But as someone who has worked for three Tory leaders tells me: “It is one of the weirdest unforced errors I have ever seen.”As part of efforts to deal with this problem, Operation Anson has been launched. This week, the team involved arrested  people on suspicion of involvement in this activity after targeting  marinas and harbours.The test of this surge in enforcement activity will be whether it stamps out this vile trade before more people perish in the Channel.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is not clear who runs it, but it also operates two websites: globalclimatestrike.net and peoplesdemands.org.On the latter, it publishes what passes as its manesto. Read it, and it becomes very clear what lies behind the climate strikes.It is really the anti-capitalist movement — the lot who used to demand an end to globalisation — in green disguise.Astonishingly, it opposes not just nuclear energy but also “mega hydro” , biofuels and carbon capture and storage.These are all technologies central to the Government’s ambition to cut UK carbon emissions to net zero by .Yet FridaysfortheFuture wants the world to move to zero carbon energy by  —  years earlier.How on Earth does it expect to achieve that  It wants humanity toto living in pre-industrial conditions.And it wants to “support non-market approaches to climate action”.In other words, it wants some kind of primitive socialist society.The trouble is thatwe went back to living in pre-industrial conditions we would very rapidly end up with pre-industrial levels of hunger, disease and child mortality.There is another way to tackle climate change, which is to invest in renewable energy and other low-carbon tech through a liberal, market economy to build a proper energy infrastructure.Children are right to be concerned about the planet, but they might care to take a closer look at the  ideology behind their climate strikes. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We were promised that we would.But a half-hearted and incompetent strategy from Theresa May, alongside a well-funded, relentless campaign to undermine the referendum and the Government’s negotiating position, has left us still in the EU after three years of drt and doom-mongering.Matters have been made worse by Speaker John Bercow’s bias, which has brought Parliament into disrepute.But in response, Jeremy Corbyn is in danger of adopting a still more absurd and tragic position, urged by senior figures Emily Thornberry and John McDonnell.To renegotiate a deal, to put it to yet another referendum, and then to campaign against that deal and in favour of remaining in the EU after all.What a self-defeating proposition. To give credit to the EU negotiators, they have played hardball all along and used every trick to avoid concessions.Imagine how they would negotiatethey knew that our Government would be committed to telling the public to reject that deal afterwards!Unfortunately, this policy may become a reality. All too many activist delegates to Labour Conference are out of touch with the history and the values of the party, and do not respect traditional voters’ opposition to EU federalism and neoliberalism.This is leading to anger and disillusionment in leave voting areas, which a majority of Labour MPs represent. Many decent, patriotic Labour voters feel alienated by the suggestion they were at best foolish to vote to Leave and should know better next time.Labour should take warning. Labour voters in seats we must win to take seize power may never dream of voting Conservative. BUT they now have a credible option.The Brexit Party has a clear promise to follow through on the referendum vote. It includes left-wing MEPs and cannot be dismissed as simply UKIP mark II.If Labour does not recognise this danger and recommit to our existing policy of honouring Brexit, its future may be bleak.

Until your taxes are educating those displaced kids in newly-overwhelmed comprehensives, while their wealthy parents suddenly have £, free for even better holidays.And once Labour has seized schools’ private property, why would they stop there  Nothing is safe — not your business, ­savings, pension or home.Who will want to live, or invest, in a country run by class war extremists who don’t even respect property ownership  No one, as Venezuela discovered.This is before we even get to Labour blowing our taxes on “reparations” to other countries for our colonial past. Or the “free everything” splurge with which they hope to dupe the slow- witted. It would require hundreds of billions of pounds. Where from Not the “rich” — you won’t see them for dust.But Labour has somehow equalled this madness with their Brexit policy. On the biggest issue since the war they have literally no view. They’re neutral.Good luck selling that to Leavers — or Remainers. Everyone, in other words.And yet there are ex-Tories who apparently still prefer the risk of this shambolic horror show running the country over fulfilling the promises they once made to the Leave-voting majority.It is a historic error.London Mayor Sadiq Khan tweeted this evening: I do not believe this decision reflects the views of the overwhelming majority of Labour members who desperately want to stop Brexit.Labour IS a Remain party.The decision is a victory for Labour boss Mr Corbyn, who was saved by his union paymasters backing his fudge as an official position.Hes been desperate for years to keep both sides of his warring party on side - promising them they could have it both ways.James Cleverly MP, Chairman of the Conservative Party, said: Jeremy Corbyn and Labour have once again dodged making any decision on Brexit, proving yet again all they offer is more of the same – more talk, more indecision and more pointless delay.It is now official Labour policy to delay Brexit until at least  and even longerthe EU demand it.Only Boris Johnson and the Conservatives will get Brexit done by  October, whatever the circumstances, and get on with delivering the change that people voted for.Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir told the party just minutes before the vote: If you want a referendum - Vote Labour.If you want a final say on Brexit - Vote Labour.If you want to fight for Remain - Vote Labour. Labour will let the people decide.He said this evening he was disappointed the party had voted to hold off on a decision but was confident the party would back Remain later.I think most people will realise that the Labour Party membership is so overwhelmingly in favour of Remain, it’s obvious where this will end up, he told Politico.But Lib Dem boss Jo Swinson said he was a secret Brexiteer and refused to show leadership.She stormed: Jeremy Corbyn has again shown a total lack of leadership on Brexit and settled on yet another fudge on the biggest issue facing our country.Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly had the opportunity to put the full force of the Labour behind a Remain position, but he has once again shown today that he is a Brexiteer at heart.The party will spend thre months trying to get a new Brexit deal with the EU.And they will then have a special conference to decide whether to campaign for or against it in a second referendum.Mr Corbyn could also give his shadow cabinet a free vote on the issue, meaning they could campaign however they liked.Unions Unite and GMB saved Mr Corbyns skin by backing his plan this evening.Unites Len McCluskey told conference: Please give Jeremy the support he needs later.But Unison OPPOSED Labours ruling bodys motion - in a huge break with tradition which could have tipped the balance towards Remain.Earlier MP Stephen Kinnock joked that Labour has had more Brexit positions than the Karma Sutra.The Aberavon MP described the first few days of the conference as utter shambles and slammed the partys move away from respecting the referendum.Our position on Brexit is being treated with ridicule on the doorsteps in my constituency, he said.Momentum boss Jon Lansman blasted: I’m incredibly disappointed with the process by which today’s NEC statement on Brexit was produced. There was no meeting, no discussion, no consultation with the membership.And Tories immediately launched into their confusing Brexit stance.Jake Berry MP said: Labour will negotiate a new Brexit deal, then hold a special conference to decide which side to back.Theyll then ignore the  referendum and hold another, where theyll either support Remain, the deal theyve negotiated or stay neutral.Got it  🤔Jeremy Corbyn launched into a huge rant this morning as he crumbled under Brexit pressure.The Labour boss raged at the media just hours before the crucial showdown.As he was followed by reporters this morning Mr Corbyn shouted: This is our conference, these are our stalls!Your behaviour, pushing past people, pushing people over and pushing people who want to visit stalls, is totally unacceptable!And he blasted: I’m asking you to behave with respect to our members and our conference.It comes after he snapped repeatedly at BBC boss Andrew Marr yesterday during an interview.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said this morning: I think people should express their own judgement on this.There will be some who think we can get adeal, but there will be others like myself who think you cannot get a better deal than Remain.If the Labour boss had lost it would have been a huge blow to his authority.Andrew Gwynne Shadow Communities Secretary told Radio s Westminster Hour on Sunday that the shadow cabinet have been told by Jeremy Corbyn that they can campaign as they want on Brexit in a future referendum - just like in the  EU vote."},{"url":null,"title":"steve irwin family feud joy bob australia zoo","story":"The Crocodile Hunter star died in Batt Reef, Australia, after a stingrays barb pierced his heart.Joy says she would have spoken about the rt earlier, but there was a confidentiality agreement stopping her from doing so.But since it has now lapsed, Joy told the Daily Mail, the state of her familys current relationship is very sad.She added: I keep away from all that.

Being too heavy raises a person’s risk of type  diabetes, liver and heart disease, and several common cancers.A new report from the British Psychological Society calls for an end to fat shaming.And said ministers must tackle the obesity crisis in the same fashion as smoking.Researchers argue people pile on the pounds as a result of a complex combination of factors, including genetics, stressful childhood experiences, busy lestyles and easy availability of junk food.Chartered psychologist Dr Angel Chater from the University of Bedfordshire, one of report authors, said obesity levels have rocketed by nearly a fth between  and .She said: “This cannot be explained by a sudden loss of motivation across the four nations of the UK.“The increase in obesity can in part be attributed to changes in the food supply and physical activity environment.“So the people most likely to be an unhealthy weight are those who have a high genetic risk of developing obesity and lives shaped by work, school and social environments that promote overeating and inactivity.”Experts added up to half of adults attending specialist obesity services have experienced childhood adversity.The report warns dieters are also particularly susceptible to emotional eating.The British Psychological Society does not support following the example of the World Health Organisation and classing obesity as a disease.But said it remains important to avoid language and explanations that locate the problem of obesity within iniduals.Sarb Bajwa, chief executive of the BPS, said: The Government acknowledged that obesity was a threat to the health of the nation back in , but the problem has continued to get worse.We need a similar effort on obesity to the one we have seen on smoking.It has taken action at all levels for decades, from government policy to helping inidual smokers, but we are now seeing signicant reductions in the level of smoking and the health problems it causes.Psychologists have the science and clinical experience to help the health service do the same for obesity.” Matt Lambert, from the World Cancer Research Fund, said: “People do not become overweight or obese overnight.Instead we are faced day-in and day-out with unhealthy environments that make junk food convenient, cheap and all too readily available.“Once we stop blaming iniduals maybe we can start taking action so that future generations are not crippled by this epidemic.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Only a ­couple of weeks ago some Christian “End is nigh” nutter was roaming the market and the show had no qualms about introducing Rev Lucas Johnson, who was driven to kill by his Christianity.This slanted agenda defines EastEnders as much as all its murders, rapes and abductions.The only thing that’s changed here, since the dawn of time , is the amount of ­scrutiny and competition it gets, which, given that ratings have recovered, means the misery will probably continue indefinitely.Still, on the positive side, Adam Woodyatt’s tenderloin of Iberico pork, with parsnip three ways, has seen him through to the next round of Celebrity MasterChef.#PrideOfWalford.Sent in by the brilliant Reenie E.Picture research: Marta Ovod.STRICTLY Come Dancing came out of the traps like Johnny Vegas on the opening leg of a x metres relay on Saturday.Two weeks they’ve been rehearsing and viewers still aren’t trusted enough to vote.Instead, the contestants laid out their nervous credentials over  testing minutes.“Eighteen years in the Premiership and I’ve never been as nervous as . . . ”We know, we know.There was an awful lot of “great energy” flannel from the judges as well, including Craig Revel Horwood, who needs to ignore any “be more positive” instructions.This ’s already compromised enough by the fact Motsi Mabuse’s sister Oti has – by accident rather than design – ended up with Kelvin Fletcher, who’s one of the favourites.Mercully, there are two dancers no amount of “great energy” can save.

The ambitious pledges will be unveiled after the number of emergency food parcels handed out by the Trussell Trust charity soared to .million last year. The targets will not be legally binding and food banks will not be shut down to meet them.But they would lay down the gauntlet to an incoming Prime Minister to stop Brits going hungry under a Labour government.   Green-fingered Jeremy Corbyn will also oversee a £m fund for allotments - alongside other measures like community kitchens and healthy eating classes in  deprived areas. And Labour will announce plans for a Fair Food Act to ensure everyone in the UK has a legal right to food, similar to other human rights. The new law would create a National Food Commission - an independent body that could take legal action against the government or councilsthey breached peopleaposs rights. Shadow Environment Secretary Sue Hayman, who will announce the measures on Tuesday, said: “This government’s mean-spirited welfare policies and failure to think dferently has brought the situation to crisis point. Food is a basic human right. We will make sure no one in the country needs to go hungry.    The policies come after the number of food banks in the UK topped ,, with millions of children living in poverty.

Mr Ratclfe has flown the US to launch a campaign group called Families Alliance Against State Hostage Taking. A spokesperson said: “We will also again attempt to meet with President Rouhani or Foreign Minister Zar while they are in New York.” Speaking to reporters during his flight to New York for the summit, Mr Johnson also pledged to challenge President Rouhani to release jailed British mum Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe when the pair meet face-to-face in the sidelines of the summit.    He said: “In the course of my talks with President Rouhani …I’ll not only be discussing Iran’s actions in the region but also the need to release Nazanin and others who are in our view being illegally and unfairly held in Tehran.” He will also use the face-to-face meeting to confront President Rouhani over the attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities.

Yemen-based Houthi rebels, who are locked in a war with Saudi Arabia, have claimed responsibility for the attacks, which sent global oil prices soaring.    But a Senior UK Government Official said last night their claim of responsibility was “implausible” because of the sophistication and range of the weapons used in the attack. Iran has denied responsibility. Mr Johnson said: “Clearly the dficulty is how do we organise a response - what is the way forward - and we’ll be working with our American and European Friends to construct a response that tries to de-escalate tensions in the gulf region.” He wouldn’t rule out military action, but said it would only happen at the request of Saudi Arabia or the US.

There are ongoing tensions in my family which is all caused by Mr Beddall’s manipulative and isive lies to cover his criminal activity. I am unable to trust anyone  and I feel I cannot give his position to anybody, which gives me less time to grow the company. She said she also felt responsible as she had interviewed Beddall and judged him fit for a pivotal senior role. Ms Hayes added that the offending was a contributing factor to the loss of  jobs, affecting the businessapos reputation: Yet we feel like he has been taunting us by showing his extravagant spending on his social media.    The thefts began soon after Beddall took up his post at the firm in June . Arthur Gibson, prosecuting, said Beddall was on a £K salary and had an expense account, a company car and a laptop. The court heard Beddall had signicant access to the companyaposs financial tools, including control of its bank account. The prosecutor told hte court how on September , , while she was on holiday, Mrs Hayes, was contacted by the fraud department of Santander who said the bank had picked up a payment of just over £, to a regular supplier but noticed the banking details had changed. She and a fellow director inspected the companyaposs accounts when she got home and they discovered a number of discrepancies. One transaction showed a payment of more than £, to a motorbike supplier. Mrs Hayes searched Beddallaposs desk and found a piece of paper referring to a Suzuki machine delivered to his home. He was subsequently fired from his post. Beddall, from Warrington, denied theft, attempted theft, and fraud. He claimed his bosses were aware of the transactions, but was convicted after a trial.    He will face a Proceeds of Crime hearing in January. The firm have managed to recoup £,. In mitigation, defence lawyer Charlotte Kenny said: His we is shocked by his convictions and that will impact on her and currently as she cannot financially support herself. Jailing Beddall for two years and  months, Judge Nicholas Barker told him: I find you to be a devious and dishonest inidual and it seems to me that you began your dishonest enterprise with alarming speed. You had what you describe as a aposdream jobapos, one that many aspire to be a aposdream jobapos.

A no-nonsense defender in his time, Parker also helped England to the World Cup semi-final at Italia ’ before that well-documented defeat to Germany characterised by Gazza’s tears. What Parker, now an established broadcaster, seldom talks about is the racist abuse so horric back then that his parents did not go and watch him in a single game. Or the times thousands of fans, home and away, would chant at him: “There ain’t no black in the Union Jack!” among other, far worse insults. Parker broke that silence during the Mirror’s Boot Out Racism event at #Lab. “My parents never watched me play one professional game,” he said. “Not one. “It was not because they didn’t want to come. They were two people who worked very, very hard and mostly wanted to come. But I was scared of what would happensomeone said something in front of them. My mum was a ft in aggressive woman!”    Yesterday, his levity drew laughter but the poignant message echoed the one sent out by Tammy Abraham two weeks ago. In an exclusive interview with the Daily Mirror, the young Cha striker revealed how his mother had wept after he’d received racist abuse on social media. It is the reason why the Mirror’s Boot Out Racism campaign has been so important for so long. Footballers don’t just need a vehicle to tell their stories. They need to know that something will be done to protect them. That football will take action to bring their playing conditions into the st century. Tooting MP Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, the Shadow Sports Secretary, is leading that fight in Westminster. On the  in Brighton yesterday, she said: “I want every single young black boy, young black girl – any child who watches the TV – to say, ‘I’m not afraid to bring my mum to a match’. “I want us to be proud of our national game and every single player in it.” For that to happen, we need to turn words into action.

Dylan Hutchison, who had already paid for his stay, had to find new accommodation after the Dynastic Hotel told his family to either hand over more than £ or get out. The dad said managers were worried they would be aposbottom of the pileapos as a Thomas Cook creditor, the Daily Record reports. Mr Hutchison, , his we Charrelle, , and their son, Leo, five, had to leave the hotel as they did not have enough cash to meet bossesapos demands.    Along with pals Leigh Crombie, his partner Vicki Butchart and their son Archie, four, the gutted holidaymakers spent yesterday trying to find somewhere to sleep. They were among thousands of families caught up in the tour operator’s plunge into administration on Monday morning. And , tourists stranded worldwide are being brought back to the UK by the Civil Aviation Authorityunder Operation Matterhorn – a £million flight programme.  Dylan and his party, from Glenrothes, in Scotland, had flown from Edinburgh Airport to the Spanish resort last Wednesday for a week’s stay. They had booked the holiday last September and paid £, for each family-of-three. Dylan said: “It had been a great holiday until this happened. “Then we woke up and saw on the news that Thomas Cook had gone bust. We went to the hotel’s reception to try and check what was happening.    “We were then told by the head of reception thatwe didn’t pay €, for each of the families by pm, we would be removed from the hotel. She told us that was coming straight from the company director. “They claimed that was the hotel bill for the week even though we’d already paid Thomas Cook. “They said although we were Atol-protected, the hotel would be on the bottom of the pile to receive payment from any liquidators. “I contacted the CAA, who spoke to reception via my mobile phone but the hotel was adamant they were not accepting any guarantee of payment. It was pay €, or leave. “We didn’t have the money to pay it evenwe wanted to. “So we had to pack up our cases and hand over the room keys. We were left on the street.” The families went to a nearby bar to find shelter out of the C sunshine while they tried to find another place to stay. After a number of hours, they managed to find an apartment online costing £, along with a £ deposit, to stay in until they fly out.    Dylan, who works as a master technician, said: “It was all-inclusive package holiday with Thomas Cook which included meals, drinks and a shuttle transfer to Alicante Airport. “Our airline was easyJet so we’re told the flights back to Edinburgh Airport on Wednesday are still OK but we’ll have to get a taxi or something there. “We’ll also have to pay for food and everything until then. It’s ruined the holiday.” Last night the hotel said no one was available for comment. Transport Minister Michael Matheson MSP said: “We are saddened by the collapse of Thomas Cook which has a long history with many jobs in Scotland, the UK and overseas. “We are working closely with the UK Government and the CAA as the situation progresses and the CAA is providing detailed information for customers on their website, via a call centre and through representatives in the resorts and airports. “This will be a very worrying time for employees in Scotland, and Scottish staff based overseas, and we recognise these job losses will have a disproportionate impact on women.

Prince Rowe, , is accused of entering the hotel room with Nathan Coleman, , to try and capture incriminating footage of the footballer with Natalie Wood, . The player, who cannot be named for legal reasons, jumped out of the window wearing only his underwear after the two men entered the room. Rowe, from Birmingham, said he agreed to go to the hotel after his friend Tyrone Coleman - a former contestant on ITVaposs Take Me Out - discovered Wood had been contacting the footballer.  He said to me that his girl had some form of contact with the player -they had met on several occasions previously, Rowe told police after his arrest. He was a bit upset - he was looking to progress the relationship. He wanted to go and catch them in the act.” Rowe told Bristol Crown Court he went to the hotel with Tyrone Coleman waiting outside while he went up to the room with Nathan Coleman, . He told officers Tyrone Coleman believed Wood was playing away with the footballer and did not want to see the pair in bed together. I just wanted to seeit was that person - the footballer, Rowe told police. I was a bit star-struck by the situation. I donapost know how we got into the room. She was lying on the bed. He was sitting there with his thing out. She jumped off the bed in panic.  Before I knew it, I saw him e out of the window. When asked to described what the pair were wearing, Rowe said he was not sure about Wood but believed she was in her underwear. He described how the footballer was naked but grabbed his boxers from the side of the bed and pulled them on after he and Nathan Coleman entered the room. I didnapost know what he was jumping to - Iaposm just panicking thinking aposIaposd better try and save himapos, Rowe said. I was actually star-struck for a bit because I play football, Iaposve met footballers but to actually be in that situation with him... I was thinking apositaposswith his ding-a-ling outapos. The jury has been told the footballer jumped out of the hotel room wearing only his underwear and took shelter in a nearby restaurant for police to arrive. Rowe said he was a bodybuilder who owned a vape shop in Birmingham and did not need to be involved in anything like this.  I was just interested that I was going to see the footballer, he told officers. Thataposs all it was for me. I just feel really upset with the whole situation. He denied taking either the footballeraposs Rolex watch or designer tracksuit, which he was wearing when arrested days after the hotel room incident. Rowe insisted the tracksuit, which still had tags on, was handed to him by Wood who told him she had purchased it for the footballer. Tyrone Coleman told police Wood was not his girlfriend at the time but they had been seeing each other after meeting on social media. He said Wood revealed she previously met the footballer and had sent him videos and pictures, which he had asked for. I didnapost believe her at first, Tyrone Coleman told police. She said aposheaposs a nice guy, itaposs crazy how footballers live, he has a nice carapos. He said Wood had since discovered the player had a partner, which she had not known when they previously had sexual contact. He told officers that a plan developed for Wood, of Cleethorpes, to be filmed with the footballer in a hotel room. After the sportsman jumped out of the window, Rowe and Nathan Coleman left the hotel and met Tyrone Coleman outside, with Wood following a short time later.

The couple seemed delighted to be starting their tour, and neither of them could resist a dance with the members of the community who had turned out to greet them. Meghan and Harry both gave moving speeches during their visit, in which Harry spoke about honouring and protecting his we and being a positive role model for Archie.     Nyanga, which is about  miles from Cape Town, is known as the country’s “murder capital” after recording more murders -  - than any other police precinct in  . Meghan is wearing a £ black and white patterned dress by Mayamiko, a sustainable Malawi brand, with dark wedges. The dress has already sold out online. Harry is in dark trousers and a white shirt.  They were also wearing matching red and white beaded bracelets bearing the word aposJusticeapos, a nod to the charity they are visiting. During their visit both Meghan and Harry gave speeches, and the Duchess told the crowd: When women are empowered the entire community flourishes. You are all powerful. Harry stopped halfway through his speech to go and pick up a picture which flew out the hand of a child sitting in the crowd, before ing to the stage and carrying on. Harry said: “No man is born to cause harm to women. This is learned behaviour and we need to break that cycle. Your strength is in your spirit which for me means honouring and protecting my we and being a positive role model for my son. Meghan and Harry watched a workshop that teaches children about their rights, self-awareness and safety and provides self-defence classes and female empowerment training to young girls in the community.  Specialist British police have spent months scouting Nyanga to ensure the safety of Harry and Meghan. They are in the township to learn about the work the Justice Desk, a human rights organisation, is doing to support the development of Nyanga township children. The organisation is supported by the Queenaposs Commonwealth Trust, which has Harry as its president and Meghan as vice-president. Jessica Dewhurst, Justice Desk founder, and Theodora Luthuli, a Justice Desk community leader, were hosting the royal visit and Ms Dewhurst took the couple on a tour of ious activities being showcased in the grounds of the church.  Later today, Harry and Meghan will visit a museum dedicated to telling the story of , inhabitants of ious races who were forced to relocate during the apartheid regime in the s. The District Six Museum will be a focal point for the Duke and Duchess to learn about the history of the area and meet former residents. However, the committee which represents  families who have who have fought for decades toto the homes from which they were forcibly removed by the apartheid regime, has slammed the couple saying they have not been invited.    Shahied Ajam, chair of the District Six Working Committee, said: “I’m perplexed that the committee hasn’t been invited.”He called on Prince Harry to apologise for “the monster that his forbears created”.“Prince Harry is a representative of a former colonial power that was the architect of what transpired in District Six. Forced removals and the other apartheid evils had their roots in colonialism. “The English don’t have a good history in South Africa. They enforced and implemented segregation,” he said.    District Six is about “the people and the place, and not about a museum”, said Ajam.Earlier today they were pictured landing at the airport in Cape Town , however their British Airways flight from London Heathrow was delayed.As they stepped of the plane at about .am local time, Meghan was carrying Archie who looked adorable in a white bobble hat.

They also face a probe into their conduct in the years before the travel giant collapsed yesterday. It is expected to mean all , staff losing their jobs and thousands more among its suppliers. Directors at Britain’s oldest travel agency received £million in pay and perks in the past  years. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: “They have a moral responsibility totheir bonuses.    “They created this mess and there are large numbers of people losing their jobs. [Bosses] should hand the money back to compensate those workers.” The firm’s rivals are being accused of taking advantage of the collapse by hiking prices by hundreds of pounds.As the Government began the biggest peace-time repatriation – with an estimated , Brits stranded abroad after the company’s demise – Boris Johnson stopped short of demanding the bonuses be paid back.The Prime Minister said: “It’s not possible for me to know exactly what happened with the directors of the board... and how it came about when they paid themselves x, y or z. “But we’ve got to have a system in the future whereby we make sure that tour operators are in some way prevented from simply going belly up and then requiring the taxpayer to bring everybody home.” Hundreds of thousands of people who were yet to leave have had their holiday dreams shattered.    They include terminally-ill Matt Dominic and we Lyndsay who were given £, from well-wishers to fly to Tenere today for a kids-free week. It was to be their last holiday. Former Rolls-Royce employee Matt, , who has brain cancer, was given six months to live more than a year ago. The pair, from Derby, expect to get the money back as the holiday is covered by ATOL, but Lyndsay, , fears there will not be enough time to arrange another break. She said: “He was really looking forward to it. He’s not got a lot to look forward to.” A wedding party of  people were stranded at Manchester Airport yesterday after their Thomas Cook flight to Jamaica was cancelled. Distraught couple Lindsay Coupe, , and Lee Bramhall, , were set to jet out ahead of the ceremony on Saturday. Lindsay, of Sheffield, said: “I am gutted. You spend all that time planning and looking forward to your wedding day.” Nine-thousand of Thomas Cook’s workforce are based in the UK.    Some were in tears as they left the firm’s HQ in Peterborough, Cambs, after news broke they had lost their jobs. Peterborough MP and former Thomas Cook employee Lisa Forbes said: “These are good, hard-working people who deserve better.” The firm’s suppliers, including , hoteliers, also risk being out of pocket, with some not paid for months, threatening a wave of job losses. The first Thomas Cook “rescue” flights arrived in the UK last night. Operators including easyJet and Virgin have supplied aircraft to help with the operation co-ordinated by the Civil Aviation Authority.  The CAA admitted it could take two months for those who booked Thomas Cook hols and have yet to travel to get a refund under the ATOL scheme. Customers face the choice of either cancelling their holiday, or paying out for replacement flights and accommodation. The Insolvency Service will probe the circumstances surrounding Thomas Cook going bust, with the role of directors part of the inquiry. Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom called for a “fast-track” process.    Thomas Cook’s board, led by chief executive Peter Fankhauser, threw in the towel in the early hours of yesterday after a £.billion rescue bid failed. Cabinet ministers face criticism after rejecting the firm’s late plea for a £million bailout. Mr Fankauser insisted they had “worked exhaustively” to salvage a deal. The Swiss businessman said: “I know this outcome will be devastating to many people and will cause a lot of anxiety, stress and disruption.” The £.million he has received since taking charge in  includes a £.million bonus in . Mr Fankhauser and his two previous full-time chief executives got roughly £million between them in the past  years. The collapse has sent shockwaves through the industry. Alan Bowen, of the Association of Atol Companies, warned of a “domino effect”. Brits have hit out at “greedy” travel firms for hiking prices after Thomas Cook went bust.

Kristine Barnett, , and Michael Barnett, , allegedly dumped their Ukrainian-born daughter Natalia Grace, who has dwarfism, in a flat in the US and moved to Canada. A doctor who examined Natalia in  - the year she was adopted - determined that she was eight-years-old, but in  the Barnetts - now orced - legally changed her age to . After being charged with neglect, Kristine has bizarrely claimed Natalia was an impostor pretending to be a child and tried to kill her in a plot mirroring the horror film The Orphan.    Kristine claims -ft tall Natalia threatened to stab her and her then-husband in their sleep, pushed her towards an electric fence and poured bleach in her coffee. Kristine told DailyMailTV: She would make statements and draw pictures saying she wanted to kill family members, roll them up in a blanket and put them in the backyard. “She was standing over people in the middle of the night. You couldnapost go to sleep. We had to hide all the sharp objects.  I saw her putting chemicals, bleach, Windex something like that, in my coffee and I asked her, aposwhat are you doing apos She said, aposI am trying to poison youapos. In an interview with WISH-TV, Kristine claimed Natalia was diagnosed as both a psychopath and sociopath. Kristine denied accusations that she neglected Natalia, and claims that Natalia is an adult and was not a child when she was adopted. She claims Natalia - initially said to be as young as six when she was adopted - had already started her period and was trying to cover it up, had adult teeth and full pubic hair.  She also claims doctors examined Natalia and concluded she was suffering a severe psychological illness only diagnosed in adults. Kristine alleges the illness led to Natalia jumping from moving cars and smearing blood over mirrors. She claims the couple had Nataliaaposs age corrected after a physician told them Nataliaaposs  birth date was wrong and the daughter had made a career out of pretending to be a young child. Natalia suffers from a rare form of dwarfism that means she is ft tall and has problems walking.  Because of her condition it has been dficult for doctors to determine her age. When she was adopted it was claimed she was six. In  a doctor said she was about eight, and an evaluation in  showed that she was a minor aged about , according to a police affidavit. The Barnetts had Nataliaaposs age changed to  and later rented an apartment in Lafayette, Indiana, in  and left her there alone.  The foster parents moved to Canada with their two sons, where one of them was attending a prestigious physics school west of Toronto. Police have charged the Barnetts with neglect. According to the affidavit, Michael admitted to police that he and Kristine had Nataliaaposs age changed to  even though doctors had determined she was a minor. The document states: Michael Barnett admitted Kristine Barnett told Natalia to tell others Natalia looked young but was actually .  One of the coupleaposs friends back in Indiana told TV station News  that the Barnetts were scammed into adopting the girl. The friend, who wasnapost named, said: She just found out two weeks ago through the media that sheaposs in trouble. She said there were two trials years ago to re-age the girl. It wasnapost like its something the state doesnapost know happened. Sheaposs very confused as to why all of this were to come up.

The -square mile island of Ikaria claims to have more nonaganerians than any other place on the planet. Research suggests one in three inhabitants of the picturesque island reach the age of .  So itaposs no surprise that researchers have been trying to decode the secret to the elderly islandersapos longevity - finding clues in their Mediterranean diets, midday naps and sex well into their vintage years.    Anthropologists have long pointed to fresh, healthy Mediterranean diets rich in fish and olive oil as an elixir of long-le. The so-called blue zone describes the regions dotted around the world where populations are thought to live the longest. Along with Ikaria, in the Aegean Sea, anthropologists have identied the worldaposs blue zones to include: the Japanese island of Okinawa, claimed to be home to the worldaposs longest-lived women, Costa Ricaaposs Nicoya Pensinsula where there were lower than normal rates of middle-aged mortality, and Italian tourism beautyspot Sardinia. Backed by National Geographic, bestselling author and longevity Dan Buettner and his research team of demographics experts have in recent years explored blue zones including Ikaria in hopes of unlocking their secrets to long le.   He wrote in the New York Times in  of his visit to the island - noting how previous claims of long-living populations were often debunked - but Ikariaaposs reputation held steadfast.Researchers found record-keeping in some villages storied for localaposs longevity meant many people didnapost actually know their own ages. Whataposs more, some beauty-spots discovered that reputations for longevity drew tourism. But researchers in Greece found solid documentation to back Ikariaaposs claims of a long-living population. They discovered locals reached the age of  at two-and-a-half times the rate Americans do.    Successive studies have found the islandaposs villagers were in comparatively better health, and living longer before they were beset with cancer, cardiovascular disease, dementia and depression. A University of Athens School of Medicine study analysed the diet of hundreds of Ikarians, finding they consumed plenty of beans and fish - and ate meat only about five times a month. The Ikaria Study also found the elderly islanders had a diet low in refined sugar but high in olive oil. They noted the islanders consumed two to three cups of coffee and two to four glasses of wine a day. Mr Buettneraposs own research teamaposs interviews found islanders enjoying diets low in heart disease-inducing saturated fats found in meat and dairy, and high in antioxidant-rich and pesticide-free greens grown in their own gardens.

Luna Fenner was born with Congenital Melanotic Nevus - an abnormally dark skin patch composed of pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. It affects just . per cent of the worldaposs population and puts sufferers at an increased risk of developing a cancerous melanoma. In Lunaaposs case, she was born with a large dark aposnevusapos on her face which is reminiscent of a Batman mask. Her mum Carol, , of south Florida, has been searching for a treatment and only found doctors in the US willing to perform laser surgery.  But following media attention earlier this year a Russian surgeon came forward and offered to perform pioneering treatment which is not available in America. Carol said: “They have technology there that isn’t available in the US yet, in the US it would take four years for Luna to be treated, but in Russia I’m told it will be  months. “The doctors in the US kept giving me dferent advice, I felt so lost, and didn’t know what to do. “Everybody thinks I’m crazy to go to Russia but I have done a lot of research and gained advice from several doctors and I really think that this is the best option for Luna right now.”    It took doctors six days to diagnose Lunaaposs condition after her birth in March . Carol said: “I was in complete shock. When Luna was first born nobody in the room knew what the condition was. “My last ultrasound before the birth had revealed nothing abnormal. MRI scans did not detect cancer but Carol was warned that the condition could evolve into the disease in future. She began desperately searching for surgeons who could perform operations to help her daughter’s condition.    Full-time mum Carol said: “A surgeon in Boston all told me that Luna must be subjected to over  sessions of laser treatments. “I didn’t feel comfortable with that, I wanted her to start school at the right time and feel like she could fit in with the other kids. “Other surgeons in New York, Chicago and Florida told me that laser would be the worst thing for Luna. They all had very dferent opinions about what to do and when.” Just as Carol was losing hope a new message arrived from across the world.She received a message from the office of surgeon-oncologist Pavel Borisovich Popov, MD, PhD of  laserterapy.ru .Carol said: “He had seen Luna’s case in a Russian newspaper and he said he had some options for Luna that weren’t available in the USA yet.    After discussions with Dr. Popov, Carol and her husband, Thiago Taes, , who works in construction, decided that they would give it a try. Carol said: “They will check her and do some exams.” “Dr. Popov agreed for me to meet some parents of patients who have done it before.” “My husband will stay here to pay for bills and everything.” If her initial tests go to plan then Luna will receive six to eight surgeries over the course of  months, with each procedure costing around , USD - a total of ,. A GoFundMe page set up by the family has so far raised , out of a target of , to pay for her ongoing treatment. Carol said: “It’s been very dficult for us to raise the money. We still have a long way to go.” Tomorrowsix-month-old Luna will head to Krasnodar in southern Russia with her mother for tests.    Amid all the uncertainty regarding Luna’s condition Carol says she hasn’t taken time to process what is about to happen. She said: “I haven’t stopped to think about it yet. I think I am probably going to freak out when we get to the airplane.” “It will be a huge reliefit works for Luna.” Carol says that besides her unusual skin condition Luna is just like any other six-month-old child. “She just learned how to jump and she giggles all the time, she’s very calm, she doesn’t cry often. “I want to finish the surgeries before she heads to school. “I don’t want her to get bullied.

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources.

Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate. We are asking adults to step up alongside us and make this a turning point in our history.#Greta Thunberg was welcomed by the Speaker of the House of Commons, the leader of the Labour Party and the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. She also spoke at the elite gathering of business leaders in Davos and at the UN.In March , school strikes took place in more than , cities around the world.

This area is also very popular with families who picnic on the flat land beside the river. Haylodge Park has always been a well-manicured park and this is what makes it such a beautul place to visit and use.He questioned whether the plans had been ldquoproperly thought through given that such meadows require upkeep and maintenance.He added: ldquoThese proposals seek to change the very nature of Haylodge Park which is central to recreational le in Peebles.ldquoThe intention to increase bioersity is a noble one, but where needs to be carefully considered.ldquoThe areas identied are heavily used, particularly along the waterrsquos edge and, in my view, should not change. I recognise that others may have a dferent view and hope thatthey do they let us know what they think.SBC leader Shona Haslamis supportive of the plans, she said: ldquoThe way that we manage our green spaces is a hot topic at the moment but one that requires reflection and a reassessment of how we view these essential parts of our town.ldquoOur knowledge of bioersity has increased hugely in the past few years and we are all very aware of the challenges that we are facing with regards climate change.ldquoWe all have to do our bit to ensure that our wildle has the space that it needs, balanced with ensuring that our public spaces remain popular and useable.ldquoWe are all very used to carefully manicured paths, but actually how wildle-friendly are they  Or are they actually sterile green spaces that, while pretty, are not actually doing anything much good ,params: .pushldquoBy leaving the grass and wildflowers to grow we are creating valuable habitats for our wildle, we are protecting our river banks.ldquoWouldnrsquot it be amazing to see otter families back in that stretch of the river as we have seen in other stretches  It also helps to limit access to the river without the need for unsightly fencing.Councillor Haslam said a mown path would ensure everyone could still enjoy the space and walk along the riverside.ldquoWe cannot continue to do what we have always done and expect a dferent result. We have to look at new ways of improving our public spaces, for the benefit of all, including our wildle.Councillor Stuart Bellsaid he welcomed the introduction of bioersity but warned that the council must be wary of making changes simply to save money.He added: ldquoIrsquove seen the introduction of bioersity areas in other parts of the Borders and these do need on-going and specialist care and attention or they just become an unsightly mess of weeds.I trust that the councilrsquos neighbourhood services team have the skills to manage the changes."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-week","story":"This weeks Pet Of The Week, from Borders Pet Rescue, is a bonded pair of rabbits called Mfy and Boo.The charity told us: \"Mfy is a seven-year-old neutered brown girl and Boo is a two-year-old black and white boy.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

Itrsquos just that we have stopped noticing the magic that is real.In our world, a frog may not turn into a prince with a kiss, but a caterpillar turns into a butterfly, a tadpole into a frog.And such magic is all around us. Leaves change colour with the seasons, magic transformation is everywhere. Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power. It was scary but also spectacular.In  such a storm was believed to have been the result of magic conjured by the ldquoNorth Berwick Witches.That storm, like the recent one, was indeed magic, conjured by nature, which can whip up a whirlwind more effectively than any wizard or witch.Magic is real.

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule.

Wood denounced the councilrsquos decision to block the parades as ldquostupid. This seems harsh, although the immediate backlash does show this cautionary step backfired. As Wood commented in a newspaper article, outright bans simply allow resentment to fester and violence to erupt where.Explosions of sectarian aggression and abuse are an obvious outrage, but even entirely peaceful religious marches through Glasgow are a blot on the cityrsquos reputation. Whenever a Grand Orange Lodge goes past, banging drums, playing flutes and waving banners, I feel I have stepped back three centuries. In theory, Orange marches are harmless and legitimate expressions of faith and historical commemoration. In practice, in the west of the country at least, they are the unlit end of a fuse that doesnrsquot take much to ignite. Everyone knows these are potentially inflammatory occasions, and a marching season that passes without incident is the very definition of a miracle.As is all too evident, sectarian prejudice is alive and well. Those who say it is nearly extinct are either optimists or judge todayrsquos level of confrontation against a much bloodier and more ignorant past. By that measure, certainly, things are considerably better than they were even as recently as when I joined this newspaper when on my first day a new colleague commented on the arrival of yet another Protestant. Anti-discrimination laws have helped promote more enlightened attitudes, but even without this statutory inducement to scrupulous fairness, the majority of us these days make no distinction between Catholic and Protestant,indeed we even notice it at all.:Faith no more  Have catholic schools had their day, asks Kevin McKennaThe country has come a long way since the Church of Scotlandrsquos disgraceful and virulent anti-Catholicism in the s, and the barefaced discrimination and hurtful jibes Catholics of all ranks endured. No wonder separate schools were considered necessary. Yet while levels of abuse and discrimination are dramatically lower than before, in some quarters hoary old grievances and antediluvian attitudes continue to smoulder.You could argue that the answer is education: an ongoing challenging of closed minds that will eventually lead to a state where nobody cares what religion other people follow. It is Tom Woodrsquos contention, however, that in order to eradicate sectarianism we need to abolish Catholic schools. These, he believes, are the root of the problem.With some reluctance, I have to agree their time is up. This, despite knowing that endorsing this view would appear to be rejecting the liberal values that I consider essential for a fair and well-run country. If parents wish to send their children to a school whose principles are guided by the Catholic faith ndash or any other for that matter ndash surely they should be allowed that choice  By all accounts, the education students receive in Catholic schools is impressive, and in some cases so enviable that lapsed members of the church appear to have a Damascene reawakening in order to get their offspring into the classroom.Yet the existence of this archaic system of schooling is tangible evidence of a problem that refuses to wither. From early childhood, separate schools reinforce the idea of dference, segregation and distinction. Whatever side of that school fence you walk, you are made aware from Primary One onwards of the concept of Them and Us.Therersquos another distasteful aspect of segregated schools too. Richard Dawkinsrsquos new book, Outgrowing God, which is aimed at young readers, tries to help ldquobreak the cycle of indoctrination. That word will be offensive to those who think they are doing their best by their children in instructing them in their own religious beliefs and culture, be they Catholic, Protestant, Muslim or Jew. But, even when done with the best intentions, sending a child to a school affiliated to a church is a form of intellectual and emotional programming. It represents the opposite of liberal values.:Catholic schools are rated higher by inspectorsFor as long as it is possible to put a child through a denominational education, society is tacitly acknowledging the power of religion to define who people are. In an age when the state is increasingly non-religious in its decision-making, in order to maintain strict neutrality and equality, it makes no sense. When single-sex institutions are frowned upon as out-dated, when discrimination based on ethnicity, background or sexual orientation is considered abhorrent, it seems odd that this particular expression of dference is allowed to continue. Onlysectarianism were unheard of, rather than a persistent blight, would it ndash just about ndash be acceptable.Back in the real world, the existence of educational pigeon-holes like these means there is little hope of religious bigotry being eradicated. Those on either side of the school gates live in an environment that allows this shameful stain on our country to persist, and even flourish. Initiatives to raise awareness or to banish deep-rooted prejudices can never be wholly successful so long as the public statement of religious identity is allowed such a state-sanctioned .This is not to attack faith itself. What iniduals choose to believe, and the ways in which they introduce children to their religion or creed at home, is their business. Nor should schools cease to teach pupils about world religions, or to help them understand the huge cultural influence that Christianity, both Catholic and Protestant, has exerted on countless aspects of our lives, for good and ill.Complete integration, however, should be the goal. The building blocks of society must mirror the kind of world we want future generations to inherit. No matter how you look at it, denominational schools have become an anomaly. If sectarianism is to become a thing of the past, then so should they."},{"url":null,"title":"Labour s self-destructing Brexit policy     negotiate and reject     is incoherence on stilts","story":"Labour are of course correct that the Liberal Democrats have made a nonsense of their own party name by refusing to recognise the democratic vote for Brexit in .

The Liberal Democrats, who were in government at the time with the Tories, would simply have just rejected it. Impossible to implement. Scots didnt know what they were voting for.

It is marginally more democratic, at least in offering voters a choice. But what a choice.Jeremy Corbyn says that he will negotiate a new and better Brexit than the Tories. Britain would remain in the EU Customs Union with the closest possible alignment with the European Single Market. Britain would retain all the work place and environmental protections that Theresa May offered to add to her Withdrawal Agreement that Labour rejected.Under Labours plan the UK would therefore remain under the rules of the single market, overseen by the European Court of Justice, and would have all trade policy set by Brussels.

However, just how would this look to a Brexit voter Labour is proposing to put Remain and their Norway Plus as the only choices in their Final Say referendum. But is that really a choice  It sounds like Remain v Leave-in-name-only. Thinking back to the Scottish vote, it would be like holding an independence referendum in which the choices were: Remain in the UK versus Federalism. That would have been condemned, rightly, because independence supporters were denied any say.I am a supporter of remaining in the European Union. I have long argued that the Norway option is the obvious compromise. But it seems to me inconceivable that a referendum on leaving the European Union could exclude the option of, er, leaving the European Union. What are they thinking The trouble with both Labour and the Liberal Democrats is that theyrsquore talking to themselves. Brainwashed by their social media feeds, they think that Brexiteers are a species of bigots who dont deserve to have the vote at all. Some academics have actually said that there should be an educational qualication before people are allowed to vote.But this isnt the worst of Labours Brexit policy. Mr Corbyn first has to negotiate his ldquocredible Leave option\", a bespoke deal that allows the UK to have all the benefits of membership of the European Single Market without actually being a formal member of it. But Labours Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, and the Shadow Foreign Secretary, Emily Thornberry, say theyll campaign for Remain in the Final Say, against their own partyrsquos policy.What is Brussels going to say  Well, Mr Corbyn, we really dont see why we should be bending over backwards, sideways and upside down in order to offer a deal that your lot are going to reject in a referendum. Thank you for coming.If Labour get a deal that meets all their criteria on jobs, environment, trade, free movement etc, so why on earth would they vote against their own negotiating triumph, their own policy  ldquoWe the Labour Party have reached an agreement with the European Union that gives us everything we asked for, so we are going to reject this disgraceful sell-out.Not so much a Final Say as Famous Last Words. No wonder Fiona Bruce was confused on Question Time. This incoherence explains why Labour has been overtaken by the Liberal Democrats in the latest YouGov opinion poll.The opposition have lost the plot on Brexit. Its not a good look when political parties make fools of themselves. Im almost tempted to say: come back Theresa May, all is forgiven. Perhaps the Labour MP, Stephen Kinnock, is right: Labour should have voted for Mays compromise, or at the very least abstained, when they had the chance.Her Withdrawal Agreement is the best that Brussels was prepared to offer, and she conceded quite a lot to Labour on employment rights and the environment. The UK was going to be allowed to remain, effectively, in the single market and customs union until a new trade deal was negotiated. The idea that the EU would offer more to Jeremy Corbyn, only for his party to reject it, is for the birds.Boris Johnson is clearly going to bring back a version of Mays Withdrawal Agreement, sans the Irish Backstop, even though it was rejected three times in parliament. And yes, I know it wasnt rejected solely over the backstop, but times change. Anyway, there will still be a backstop, only it will have moved to the Irish Sea in Boriss cunning plan. But parliament is going to have to take a good look at itself when this is put before MPs on October .The Benn Act, that compels the government to avoid no-deal, will surely be null and voidparliament rejects the only deal on offer. The only certainty then will be Article , which triggers Britains departure from the European Union whether or not there is a deal. MPs voted by a majority of  to trigger Article  in . They have voted down every alternative since then.I dont actually believe that Boris Johnson wants a crash-out Brexit: he is proud that he has managed to get movement from Brussels. But make no mistake. If parliament continues to preicate, and fails to come up with a majority for any kind of compromise, then Britain is scheduled to leave the EU on October . It is irresponsible to demand a further extension of Ait is to no purpose.It sickens me to say it, but there is a half-decent Brexit deal on offer and MPs will have to think very carefully before rejecting it. The alternative will not be revoking A, or a referendum, both of which have been rejected by MPs. The alternative will be a hard-right Brexit. And parliament will be as much to blame as Boris Johnson."},{"url":null,"title":"orange-order-not-surprised-marches-pass-peacefully","story":"No arrests were made during four Loyalist marches including a parade led by Govan Flute Band at the weekend which involved around  people from  bands from across the West of Scotland.The three other parades were in Springburn, Drumchapel and the city centre.Jim McHarg, Grand Master of the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland, said: ldquoWe were pleased, but not surprised, to hear that the weekendrsquos parades passed off without incident.ldquoOur members and supporters simply wish to be able celebrate their own heritage, as others are free to celebrate theirs.ldquoIf we all show a mutual tolerance and respect to each other, we can all continue to promote our own faith, culture and heritage in our great city.Glasgow City Council also recognised that tensions in the city had reduced following two previous weekends of disorder and signalled they will continue to have talks with organisers of marches.A spokeswoman said: ldquoIt looks like tensions around marches have reduced after the appalling scenes wersquove seen in recent weeks.ldquoWe look forward to continuing a dialogue with organisers, the police, the Government and local communities to move toward a state of normality.It comes after it emerged council officials asked organisers to consider withdrawing the Pride of Govan Flute Band march to reduce tensions in the city.Police intelligence suggested that the band, who have marched the same route for  years, would be met by as many as Republican protesters who were expected to carry out a signicant protest with elements of ldquoviolence and ldquodisorder.The force confirmed, however, that the parade passed without incident or arrest.They added that no protesters had been identied at any of the marches throughout the day.Chief Superintendent Hazel Hendren, isional commander for Greater Glasgow Division, said: ldquoAll four of the processions passed off without incident, with no protesters identied on any of the routes or anywhere  in the city.A signicant police operation was however in place for the parade.

The chemical industry creates .%, printing .%.So the great problem to be figured out is: how do we rein in production and consumption in order to tackle climate change, while still maintaining economic growth, the guiding light of every government The collapse of the travel company Thomas Cook sits slap bang in the middle of this debate. Of course, Thomas Cook wasnrsquot destroyed by consumer choice linked to climate change ndash it collapsed due to commercial challenges from internet rivals. But the collapse proves two things: firstly, people arenrsquot travelling less, theyrsquore just travelling more cheaply with online companies not high street ones. So even as climate change becomes the biggest global issue, people are still not changing their lestyles in any meaningful way.

To achieve this, Labour would remove independent schoolsrsquo charitable status ndash something the Scottish Government has been consulting on for much of this year ndash redistribute their endowments, investments and properties to the state sector, and require all universities to take just seven per cent of their students from independent establishments, reflecting the make-up of the wider population.It was just the kind of posturing that Corbynistas have been crying out for and, with the anticipation being that the policy,ever enacted, would spell the end of private schools altogether, the Abolish Eton campaign greeted it with jubilation. Campaign organiser Holly Rigby, a state school teacher who had helped push the issue up the partyrsquos agenda, called it a ldquoreally big victory for the left, adding that ldquothis is a really positive moment for the Labour Party because itrsquos the strongest commitment that the party has made to deal with the problem of private schools in a very long time. Itrsquos a really radical commitment as well.But how much of a victory can Labourrsquos motion really be when all it does is make private schools the problem that needs to solved rather than addressing the very real issues that hold back too many in the state sector too  Is the policy really worth crowing about when, far from making all state schools that little bit better, it may actually stand more of a chance of making them that little bit more crowded, that little bit more stretched and so that little bit worse It is a lie perpetually spun by those running private schools that what they offer is a superior education when in fact all they provide is an expensive, resource-rich and selective one. Indeed, study after study has shown that when things like socio-economic status are controlled for, the type of school a child attends has little or no impact on their academic attainment. Yet while it would be nice to imagine a wider distribution of the little things that set private-school kids apart ndash the polish of one-to-one tuition, the confidence of knowing your opportunities are endless ndash the opposite is likely to be true in a state-school-only world. Parents, after all, are hardly likely to continue paying for an education that has been taken over by the state, while without parental funding the ability for schools to provide those things will disappear.Given that state-school kids are every bit as capable of achieving academic success as their privately educated peers, some may feel that removing the added extras that money has bought for the latter may be enough to level the playing field in and of itself. Nothing could be further from the truth, though. Because while capability is one thing, actuality is another, and the vast dferences that exist within the state-school sector are way more pernicious, and way more worthy of addressing, than those that have grown up between it and the private one.Indeed, while it cannot be right that the universities of Oxford, Cambridge and St Andrews ndash all of which are renowned for propelling graduates into the best of careers ndash take per cent of their students from private schools, neither can be it right that state-educated children in the poorest parts of the country are left trailing behind those from wealthier backgrounds. The fact the Scottish Government-funded Growing up in Scotland study found children from low-income families to be  months behind their more affluent peers in vocabulary skills and  months behind in problem-solving skills on day one of school is unacceptable, but closing down private schools will have no positive impact on that.Yes, Labourrsquos plan to require universities to address their admissions policies is long overdue ndash and some institutions are already taking action off their own bats to do just that. But unless something drastic is done to close the poverty-related attainment gap, only wealthier state kids, whose parents may well have paid a premium to live close to supposedly \"good\" publicly funded schools, will stand to benefit. And while seizing and selling swathes of valuable land owned by the likes of Eton College may seem like a good way to fund the closing of that gap ndash and it would certainly win the votes of those on the hard left ndash does anyone really believe they would give it up without a long and costly fight  What would happen to attainment in the meantime There is no doubt that British society is as unequal today as it has been at any time in its history, with the rich continuing to get richer while the poor go on getting poorer. Private schools, which send their pupils down gilded paths that equally bright and equally talented children from poorer backgrounds are too often excluded from, undoubtedly have a part to play in that.But the solution to social inequality does not lie in eradicating every privilege enjoyed by the wealthy when they will simply be able to use their wealth to find ways to overcome that. Yes, it is right to expect private schools to pay their fair share of taxes and, yes, universities and workplaces should be required to reflect the make-up of the population at large, but abolishing private schools altogether  Thatrsquos just a distraction.If the Labour Party really wanted to be radical,it really wanted to score a big victory for the left, it would focus on finding ways to make schools at the bottom of the educational tree better, rather than trying to make those at the top worse."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-must-citizens-assembly-climate-change","story":"In fact since the Scottish Governmentrsquos declaration of climate emergency in April, there has been no discernible addition to plans that were indicated months ago.

Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable. For items like tea bags, coffee grounds or banana skins, recycling food waste is a vital piece of the puzzle in tackling the climate emergency.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.motherwelltimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The public is being asked to look out for squirrels  both red and grey  for the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey. \"  \"  Join in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey this weekviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.motherwelltimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"\"  \"  Obituary: Graeme Gibson, Canadian author and conservationist viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"MTHW | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"MTHW | Article Teaser\"According to the Scottish Government’s  Scottish Household survey, only  per cent of Scottish households say they recycle their food waste, despite around  per cent having access to a food recycling caddy."},{"url":null,"title":"four fifths of our carbon footprint is down to our consumption habit","story":"Businesses that don#t act now to meet growing public pressure to tackle the global climate emergency risk being left behind.That’s the warning from Zero Waste Scotland which says organisations must do more and examine how they produce, consume and dispose of everyday items just to stay in the race – and urges them to embrace the circular economy.Zero Waste Scotland stresses firms achieving a more sustainable way of working would deliver huge results in cutting Scotland’s carbon footprint. This is because four fths of Scotland’s carbon footprint is generated through the heat and energy required to grow, make, process, transport and provide materials that are often tossed aside at the end of their le.Only by considering how to make products with less reliance on raw materials, and by remaking items at the end of their original le into goods that can be used time and again, will businesses be able to signicantly reduce global emissions.Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, who launched the organisation’s corporate plan before an auduence of business leaders last week, said: “We must radically change the way we think about and consume our goods and materials, and we must do that now.” “Too many businesses assume that reducing the cost to the planet means increasing costs for them. “But as we have and will continue to make clear, the opportunities are plentul, with massive savings to be made. “The current way of working cannot continue in the years ahead and successfully adopting a circular economy approach is the only long-term option.”Everything has value and in a circular economy nothing should be wasted. In simple terms, it can be explained as ‘make, use, remake’ as opposed to ‘make, use, dispose’. The ultimate goal is to maintain and improve our quality of le, while simultaneously reducing our material consumption and, by extension, our impact on the planet.Mr Gulland added: “Many Scottish firms are already leading the way, with our help, changing how they design and trade goods to keep materials in use for as long as possible to maximise their value. “Successful circular economy enterprises range from refurbishing computers and upcycling furniture to producing sustainable animal feed using waste generated by our world-famous whisky industry.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kirkintilloch-herald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Felicitasis just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"   is just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"  Throw a Porridge Party for Mary’s MealsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kirkintilloch-herald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"These are the most popular Disney inspired names\"  These are the  most popular Disney-inspired names viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Zero Waste Scotland estimates that the circular economy would save Scottish businesses collectively at least £ billion every year through benefits including the creation of longer-lasting relationships with customers, as firms switch from a model centred on simply selling products to providing products as services. Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: “We should not underestimate our achievements to date in tackling climate change – we have already almost halved emissions since . “We cannot, however, be complacent.

They are then being asked to report where and when they saw them on the Saving Scotland’s Red Squirrels websitescottishsquirrels.org.uk.Saving Scotland’s Red Squirrels is a partnership project led by the Scottish Wildle Trust that is working to protect red squirrels where they are most under threat from the spread of non-native grey squirrels. Squirrel sightings received from the public help the project understand how red and grey squirrel populations are changing over time and decide where to focus conservation efforts.Prject manager Dr Mel Tonkin said: “We monitor squirrel populations throughout the year, and in  we received an incredible  squirrel sightings from members of the public.“This year, thanks to support from National Lottery players, we’re trying something a bit dferent.“By going out and looking for squirrels during the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey people can help us create a more detailed snapshot of the current situation on the ground.”Autumn is an ideal time of year for squirrel-watching. With leaves falling they can be easier to spot as they move through the treetops, foraging for the autumn harvest of seeds, nuts and berries. They will also be spending more time on the ground, building up stores of food in preparation for the colder months ahead.Mel added: “During the survey week you could visit a well-known squirrel stomping ground to help us keep our records up-to-date. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Jon Marshall, Zero Waste Scotlands recycling sector manager, and chief executive Iain Gulland want recycled food waste to be used to power vehicles, just like the DeLorean car in the movie Back to the Future. \"  \"  Food waste really can power cars like in the s’ Back to the Future movies viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"“Or,you’re feeling adventurous, you could visit a woodland where few sightings have been recorded before. “The more information we receive from the public, the better our understanding of Scotland’s squirrel populations will be.” Gordon Buchanan, wildle filmmaker and Scottish Wildle Trust ambassador, said: “The red squirrel is an iconic Scottish species. “Thanks to conservation efforts their populations are beginning to stabilise, but their future is still under threat. “Taking part in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey is a really simple way you can help.”The results of the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey will be published later this year.

This year Orkney boasts seven venues — some of which are participating for the first time,As far as local people are concerned, Doors Open Days is about getting into buildings for free and seeing things that you don#t often see. If buildings are usually charging an entrance fee they can take part by offering to open for free,The event benefits the organisations or venues by attracting more visitors. It helps them by becoming more involved in the community, as a volunteer or a visitor, and enhancing appreciation of local architecture and local heritage.The seven venues taking part in Orkney all have free entry.

He said: #We want to thank our residents for doing a great job in increasing the amount of metals they recycle at the kerbside.#However, we want to take that even further now by focusing on foil. I was amazed to learn that an average household can expect to use  foil trays and  metres of foil wrap each year.#The good news is that recycling a tonne of aluminium saves nine tonnes of C emissions and four tonnes of bauxite, the raw material from which aluminium is made. And aluminium can be recycled indefinitely.“So it’s clear that each household converted to foil recycling really does make a dference environmentally. The council also gets a goodfor metals recycling, which helps offset the costs of all our waste disposal activities in Orkney.“But we know from speaking to the public that some people are unaware they can recycle foil in Orkney, or aren’t aware of the benefits. That’s why, with Alupro’s help again, we’ll be highlighting foil recycling during Recycling Week and beyond.”As part of awareness-raising, the council will be installing banners provided by Alupro at recycling centres and other public places around Orkney.OIC’s waste team are also featuring facts and figures about foil recycling on the EcoActive Facebook page, and carrying out visits to schools over Recycling Week.In Orkney, householders can put aluminium foil and foil trays in the metal recycling banks at one of the council’s Household Waste Recycling Centres , or into their recycling bin. The advice is to just rinse off food residue and put in your recycling binalongside other metals you can recycle such as food and drink cans and tins, and metal lids and tops from jars and bottles.For smaller pieces of foilit#s best to make a larger ball of foilby scrunching pieces together # it will prevent smaller pieces falling through machinery during the recycling process.For more information about waste and recycling visit the council#s website or email recycling@orkney.gov.uk .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Successful generators still sell the electricity they produce on the wholesale market but receive a #top-up# payment over the course of the -year contract.Changes made to rules which had forbidden all onshore wind projects from competing in the electricity market in  meant projects in the Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney were able to compete.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it’s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.“Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.”Though they may have won favour with the government, Hoolan#s two Orkney projects have previously been met with protest from the public and rejection by councillors. More than  protestors took to School Place, last September, when the projects appeared before the OIC planning committee. Though there were no statutory objections to either project, there were  letters of objection and  of support for the Costa project. The Hesta Project, meanwhile, received a total of  objections and nine letters of support.Though councillors elected to reject the wind farms, this decision was later overturned by the Scottish Government. This sparked criticism from former planning chairman, Councillor Owen Tierney, who accused the government of #lacking faith# in the local planning system.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I look forward to the project progressing.”Led by ZeroAvia, developers of hydrogen fuel cell powertrain solutions, HyFlyer will demonstrate a phased approach from battery power to hydrogen power, integrating the new technology aboard a Piper M-class six-seater aircraft which will perform test flights out of Cranfield and Orkney.Project partners Intelligent Energy will optimise its high power fuel cell technology for application in aviation while EMEC Hydrogen, producers of green hydrogen from renewable energy, will supply the hydrogen required for flight tests and develop a mobile refuelling  compatible with the plane.The HyFlyer project will see conventional piston engines in propeller aircraft replaced by electric motors, hydrogen fuel cells and gas storage.If all goes well, ZeroAvia, based in Calornia, are aiming to supply the technology to commercial manufacturers by .Following this demonstration, the next goal then is to power an aircraft, carrying up to  passengers, to travel  miles.According to the Air Transport Action Group, aviation is responsible for  per cent of CO emissions from all transport sources and is one of the fastest growing sources of global emissions.Val Mtakhov, founder and CEO of ZeroAvia, said: “The substantial backing provided by the UK Government underlines the potential that hydrogen holds as a fuel source for commercial aviation and provides signicant validation of ZeroAvia’s approach to zero emission flight.“Our project goal of  NM is equivalent to the distance from London to Edinburgh and will prove that zero emission aviation, powered by hydrogen, can play a key role within the UK and other countries’ transport strategies — enabling net zero targets to be met and improving productivity and regional prosperity.”Richard Ainsworth, Hydrogen Project Specialist at EMEC Hydrogen, said: “HyFlyer is another key step in Orkney’s aim to decarbonise leline transport services for islanded communities.#Hydrogen has the potential to help meet our emission commitments where electrons and batteries can’t.#This project sees us one step closer to meeting our fuel and energy needs from abundant local renewable energy resources using green hydrogen.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

So when they retire the feeling of sadness is akin to a death in the family.John Humphrys of the Today programme was the irascible uncle, the kind who at dinner would be very likely to start an argument while grace was being said – but first thing in the morning his rigour and tenacity as he, metaphorically at least, pinned an evasive politician under the wheels of the radio van until the poor sap answered the question would set me up for the challenges of the day.: Jackie Bird reveals she has quit Reporting ScotlandFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereBut we in Scotland are soon to suffer a loss far more grave. When we bid farewell to this bitter and isive year Jackie Bird won’t be around to point the way towards a hopefully better . Stop all the clocks. Stop them around .pm on  December. Cancel Hogmanay!Bird has fronted BBC Scotland’s Auld Year’s Night shindig since back in the auld century. If Humphrys was the grumpy uncle then she was the whoop-it-up aunt in the sparkly dress, capable of embarrassing you in your teens with slobbery festive-season kisses, but who you’d eventually come to appreciate was a good laugh and crucial to every party.Well, the party’s over. Hogmanay Live is to be revamped – it will probably get a name-change – and won’t be hosted by Bird. Unlike Humphrys who has gone willingly and was granted a long goodbye last week and one final opportunity to rough up David Cameron, Bird had rather hoped to stay involved, despite having quit newsreading duties earlier this year. But she was only offered a ten-minute slot leading up to the bells in Edinburgh – “You’ll have had your black bun” as they sometimes say in the capital – and has declined. Now I can’t get out of my head the sad image of Bird trudging the streets on a broken heel, her carryout bag about to burst, as she peers up at tenements looking for a light in a window, flickering to the beat of Prince’s , the year she first presented Hogmanay Live. Oh, and she’s got Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain propping each other up behind her as it doesn’t look like the trusty duo will be part of the new-look show either.Maybe Bird hasn’t been your glass of warm prosecco these past  years. If that’s the case, then it’s typical of the complex relationship Scots have with Hogmanay. It’s summed up for me by memories of my mother looking out the Crabbie’s Green Ginger Wine in anticipation of first-footers on that specially Scottish night of nights – and at the same time my father bolting the door.Everything about Hogmanay is complex, including the black bun. It looks luxurious but after you’ve gorged on it you feel like you’ve swallowed a depth-charge. The idea of a gigantic party sounds great but before too long you’ll be stuck in a corner having zoned out of a conversation with a woman about schools – this is an Edinburgh party – but becoming more and more morose as you reflect on the year ending and the diddly-squat you’ve achieved during it.For a long time Scots liked being viewed as unofficial world champs at Hogmanay, partly because our dear friends in England seemed to struggle with the concept. But when that status became official and Edinburgh started hosting the biggest open-air rave-up on the planet some of us thought: “This isn’t us. This rampant exhibitionism, frolicking in the Firth of Forth and all that, isn’t Scottish. Let’s get back to drinking an estuary’s worth of beer in the privacy of our own parlours then sleeping off the hangover while everything’s shut for two whole days.”Putting Hogmanay on TV is certainly complex. As any film director will tell you, party scenes are tricky to pull off. The nightclub looks half-empty because not enough extras have been hired and when the party is in a house, actors can prove themselves surprisingly bad at dancing, though I suppose the glass heron figurines can be inhibiting. When the programme is live, the date is  December and the entertainment are pished, though, then you’re asking for trouble. There was one notorious show, Live into ’, where comedian Chic Murray “died” and actor John Grieve “corpsed” and a drunken reveller groped singer Maggie Moone mid-song. Actually there were quite a few notorious shows, presenting a portrait of Caledonia that we thought the rest of Britain and, by extension the world, wanted to see. BBC Scotland producer Iain MacFadyen was the master of these hoary heather ’n’ haggis-stuffed heuch-athons, earning him the nickname of the Ayatollah Hogmanay.To minimise risk Grampian used to drape country houses in tinsel and pre-record their New Year celebrations in August. But, you know, I reckon Bird could have coped with one of those Hogmanays from hell. I can see her smiling sweetly while Tennent’s Lager Lovelies cavort with men dressed as Lee’s macaroon bars and a flying caber knocks out the foremost authority on William McGonagall just as Simple Minds roar into a medley of their hits.Unfortunately I’m not going to see this. I’m not going to see Bird again on Auld Year’s Night and that’s a great pity. In a dignied farewell, she says she knows what’s in the re-styled show but won’t comment on it, simply wishing Beeb Scotland well with their new endeavour. Should the rest of us be worried  Perhaps. Much as I would like to be more like my mum, I fear I’m turning into my dad. Thus, not only will the door be bolted, I might have to switch off the TV as well.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"leader comment there is no travel insurance for the thomas cook employees","story":"Within hours of the Thomas Cook collapse, accusations were surfacing about rival holiday firms cashing in by hiking their prices. Meanwhile, the UK’s largest peacetime repatriation swung into action as the Civil Aviation Authority worked out how to bring , stranded tourists back home. Families turned up at airports not knowingthey were going to get to go on holidays, other stories surfaced about honeymoons and weddings thrown into chaos. It is, however you look at it, an appalling situation, and our sympathies are with everyone affected. Amid all the rolling coverage yesterday, however, one element appeared all but overlooked. The fact that , people, , of whom are in the UK have not lost their holidays with Thomas Cook’s failure but their livelihoods. While the £ million Operation Matterhorn is bringing tourists home, another looming challenge for the governments in both London and Edinburgh will be the thousands now out of work. The arguments over whether the UK Government was right to refuse a bail-out to the stricken travel giant will continue. There are questions around what it knew when and whether it could have stepped in sooner to prevent catastrophe. There is further anger over the lack of scrutiny of its actions caused by the proroguing of parliament. But none of that changes the simple fact that a -year-old business, a mainstay of the British high street for so long, has disappeared forever. Once the immediate challenge of repatriation is complete, efforts have to turn to supporting the Thomas Cook employees into alternative employment as quickly as possible. It is reassuring to see the Scottish Government has already made an offer of support through its Partnership Action for Continuing Employmentinitiative, and the support available on a UK-wide scale should be far greater.The thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos can retain some comfort that their holidays were protected by law and they will be refunded, albeit they may face a long wait. Others waiting to fly home, can be reassured that the Government will arrange alternative flights for them.The thousands out of work as a result of Thomas Cook’s demise have no such reassurance today. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"alex salmond s production firm spent 10k promoting tv show on facebook","story":"A production company co-owned by Alex Salmond spent more than #, on Facebook adverts to promote the former first minister#s chat show in the past year, data from the tech giant has revealed.More was spent on targeted adverts placed through his Facebook page than for any other inidual politician in Scotland from October  until September this year.Mr Salmond, who left front line politics in  after losing his Westminster seat, remains a dominant figure in the independence movement with a huge following on social media.Slainte Media spent a total of £, on Facebook adverts linked to the former SNP leader’s official page, which is followed by almost , people.Former SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, editor of The Alex Salmond Show on Kremlin-backed broadcaster RT, said the adverts were used exclusively to promote each episode that premiered on Facebook.She added the advertising was focused on England and overseas as the show “already has an established following in Scotland”.Mr Salmond joins a list of hundreds of inidual politicians and elected officials who have placed nearly half-a-million pounds’ worth of promotions on the site in less than a year, analysis by JPI Media can reveal.In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook began publishing details of who places - and pays for - adverts promoting political or social issues.Spending on these adshas totalled more than £.m since last October.The Scots Tories spent just over £, on adverts promoting former leader Ruth Davidson’s Facebook page in the same period, while new Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson spent £,.But nothing was spent on promoting Nicola Sturgeon’s official Facebook page, which is followed by more than , people.

Well done to all those who bothered to go out to make their feelings known, rather than sitting at home making supercilious comments online.Surely all Shetlanders are either incomers or the descendants of incomers John Ridland presumably wants to see some form of Apartheid with multigenerational residents receiving greater recognition and status.This rednecked social exclusionary nonsense just gets so tired. It might helpit can be appreciated that there are dferent types of Shetlanders, with all Shetlanders being equally valid.Maybe Shetlander is a state of mind, of wanting to care for, share in and build the community for the greater good, doing weel for the common weel and persevering.I sincerely hope John Ridland’s atypical attitude will one day be consigned to the dustbin of history.It should be challenged wherever it raises its ugly head.So far as he knows John did nothing worthy in a past le to be born in Shetland.He could equally have been born where.It’s the lottery of birth that entitles him to don that mantle and there is no need for him to be making others who also care for where they live feel unwelcome.Can he not see this inward and backwards looking approach is harming his community, not strengthening or celebrating it Shameful. #xenophobiasucks#getoveritYes Peter totally agree.Becauseyou went to live with the Pigmy people of equitorial Africa for several months you would be just as big a Pigmy as they are.That is because they #are just incomers or the descendants of incomers#.There is obviously no dference.The IPCC calls for collective international action and condemns unilateral actions e.g. #declaration of climate emergency#, as ineffective. From IPCC  Report , Summary for Policymakers, Paragraph SPM .. .“Climate change has the characteristics of a collective action problem at the global scale#, and.#Effective mitigation will not be achievedinidual agents advance their own interests independently.#The current, tawdry campaign is disreputable. It is based on Old Testament-style, apocalyptic prophecies, cynically intended to raise public alarm for grubby, political purposes and the Green Party is up to their ocksters in it.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September.

Launched officially on July , it was a case of getting straight down to business! The volunteers cover quite a large area, including Broughshane, Kells, Ballymena and the surrounding rural local areas.The group has  volunteers, however by August it had responded to  purple and red incidents in support of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service.This translates into  inidual responses. The group prefers to send more than one responder to each patient in case their needs are beyond the capacity of a single person. Cardiac arrest is a case in point and while only three of patients have been in this specic condition, many more have been suffering from chest pain.Responders grow in experience and expertise, with the group aiming to have an experienced person at each incident to support them. The four committee members have ided this task between them.The more active members are learning fast, particularly through their exposure to NIAS crews and rapid response paramedics, who have been patient and helpful with them.The group held their second monthly members meeting and training event at the end of August and used this to reflect on their experiences, share what they had learned and build vital patient care competence.More members are needed and they are asking people to get in touchthey want to volunteer. Working with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and Dalriada Urgent Care, there is a planning and training programme organised for January soyou are interested check the group out on Facebook.The group posted recently: “One thing has become clear in the course of our first month’s activity -we need to recruit and train more responders. “We are working with NIAS on dates for another training course and this will determine our recruitment timetable.”A spokesperson added: “We owe huge thanks to those who made our new service possible.“The people and organisations who contributed so generously to help us meet our funding needs.“The NIAS Community Resuscitation Development Team, who guided us through the complexities of setting up the scheme, trained our members for us and continue to support us.“The Governance team at Dalriada Urgent Care, who supported us in our recruitment efforts and other vital matters such as insurance.“The front line staff of NIAS who have supported and guided us on scene.“And, last but certainly not least, our volunteers, who continue to give the community their time and newly-acquired expertise and to meet their new challenges with great resilience and good humour.“Its a privilege to work with you.”Follow the Braid Valley Community First Responders on Facebook to keep up to date with all their news and to see how you can become involved.

Two of the sculptures from the popular Julia Donaldson-penned Gruffalo tale were completely destroyed after they were set ablaze while others were defaced. Colin Glen Forest Park is home to the unique Trail and has visitors and families from across the city visit daily to see the attraction. Mother-of-two Nicola Marley said that it is “upsetting” for her children when their “favourite character or activity is signicantly damaged or missing” along the Trail.“I participated in a project with the Princes Trust to create a small memorial garden for victims who have lost their lives as a result of mental health issues,” she said. “A lot of hard work and time went into it, many close friends and family of the victims use the garden as a peaceful space to sit and reflect. It is sad that this has now been destroyed too. The park would be a nicer and safer placethe constant vandalism stopped.”Another parent, Janine Belton, spoke of how the Gruffalo Trail “gives the children a wonderful experience and provides them with some learning within nature.” “However, the animal statues have been destroyed, leaving the children confused and sad as they believe that the animals were being ‘hurt’,” she said. Bernadette Devlin, from Colin Sure Start said that vandalism on the Gruffalo Trail was impacting the learning and development of children in the area.“We use that facility a few times a year to bring parents and our children from nought to four age range,” she said.“It promotes the kids’ speech and language, it promotes their social interaction, it helps them learn about their environment and, most of all, it allows them to have fun. It’s local and it’s free of charge, but they are unable to enjoy it as much because of the vandalism of the statues on the Gruffalo Trail. It’s a health and safety issue too because the children like to get their photos taken with the statues, but obviously they can’t do that now. There is one near the entrance and you wouldn’t even be able to identy what it is now.“We just want to make people aware of the impact it’s having on the families who are living in the community.“It’s resource that we’ve had many an enjoyable outing to, and we would like to continue to do that. It has so many benefits for community, butthis vandalism continues we’ll no be able to use it. The safety of the children is paramount to us. We would be very wary of bringing families there because of the vandalism.”Sinn Féin Councillor Séanna Walsh described those behind the destruction as “a handful of disgruntled vandals who are attacking their own community”.“Colin Glen Forest Park is a major asset for this area, the community, council and departments are investing heavily into it and we are looking at a £ million investment package for it,” he said. “The Glider has really opened up the opportunity for people and families to access the park and we have a handful of youngsters who are turning up to try and vandalise it.“The park is set to launch its latest attraction, the toboggan, soon and planning applications are in for zip lines and mountain bike trails. There are big projects planned for the park. We would ask those who behind this vandalism to stay out of it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"it could pay to back the boks in japan","story":"World rankings are a funny thing. Apparently, Belgium are the top-rated team in world football, ahead of Brazil and the actual world champions France writes our rugby tipster Paddy Tierney.In golf, Englishman Justin Rose moved to world number one ahead of the US Masters despite his one and only major victory coming at the  US Open. With the Rugby World Cup taking centre stage over the coming weeks, it is worth pointing out that Ireland are back to being the top-rated team in the world. That’s Ireland, who are rated as   shots to lt the Webb Ellis Trophy.That’s Ireland who were obliterated - in last month’s warm-up game at Twickenham.It seems back-to-back wins over Wales at Cardf and then Dublin were enough to promote Joe Schmidt’s side back to number one. Yet, Ireland have a painful history at the Rugby World Cup and have failed to make it past the quarter-final stage in eight previous attempts. In , they topped Pool D, but were humbled - by a ravenous Argentina side in the quarters. Their pain was only lessened by the fact that hosts England failed to make it out of Pool A behind Australia and Wales. However, the  winners look a dferent proposition four years on and Eddie Jones’ side are a real threat. They are   to top a Pool C group containing France and Argentina and look set to take on either Wales or Australia, who should finish first and second in Pool D, in the quarters. Pool B looks a shoot-out between world champions New Zealand and South Africa, while Ireland’s opening game against Scotland on Sunday could well determine who tops Pool A. Hosts Japan might have something to say about that and neither side will take them for granted after they caused one of the biggest upsets in the history of the competition by beating South Africa in their opening game of the  World Cup when managed by the aforementioned Jones. Either way, Ireland will face an almighty challenge to better their horrendous World Cup record as they will face either New Zealand or South Africa in the last eight.I think both Ireland and the All Blacks will top their group meaning it will be Scotland versus New Zealand and Ireland against South Africa. While Ireland have proven that they can beat any team in the world on their day, I can’t help but feel like the World Cup arrives  months too late for Schmidt’s men, who seem to thrive when they are written off. The decision to leave Devin Toner at home has ided opinion, while captain Rory Best is now  and will retire after the World Cup. Fitness doubts continue to linger about Johnny Sextonand Keith Earls, while Robbie Henshaw has been ruled out of the Scotland game with a hamstring injury and Ireland look destined for another quarter-final exit with most firms going   on that outcome. Elsewhere, I like the look of Wales at   to top Pool D and I think they’ll end up playing France in the quarter-final. If my predictions are correct, that would leave Warren Gatland’s side taking on South Africa in the last four. Wales are one of the few teams who should match the brute force of the Springboks and I wouldn’t be surprised to see them reaching the decider.That being said, almost every betting preview I’ve read has tipped South Africa as the winner and as much as I hate hopping on the bandwagon, they looked to have assembled one hell of a squad. The other semi-final could be the game of the tournament with world champions New Zealand looking like they are on a collision course with England. Australia could throw a spanner in the works in the quarter-finals, but I’ve a gut feeling fear that England will go very close. Final Prediction Thankfully, their outright odds are   are far too skinny for me to consider the unthinkable, but they may well reach the decider with an England versus South Africa final priced at a tasty-looking  . Back in , the same countries contested the decider in France with South Africa winning - in a cagey affair at the Stade De France and I fancy a repeat of that result at the ,-capacity International Stadium in Yokohama.A certain Bryan Habana was the star of the World Cup  years ago, scoring eight tries and Cheslin Kolbe could be worth a wager in the top-tryscorer market at  . The -year-old winger scored two tries at the weekend as Rassie Erasmus’s side defeated hosts Japan in their final warm-up game -. When you consider that Ireland’s Jacob Stockdale is as low as  , Kolbe looks outstanding value while George North could also be worth an each-way punt at  . The Kolbe South Africa double is also available at  , while those looking a patriotic punt could do worse than back Iain Hendersonto score the first try for Ireland in Sunday’s opening game against Scotland with the Ulster ace available at  ."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"thomas has been behind the lens for","story":"TO many people in North Belfast Thomas McMullan is a familiar face in the local community.A multiple award-winning photographer, Thomas has been the man behind the camera for  years ever since the North Belfast News started publication in .Hailing from Chatham Street in old Ardoyne, Thomas was born in  in the Mater Hospital on the Crumlin Road and came from a family of three brothers. He attended Holy Cross Boys Primary School in the district and is also a past pupil of the old St Gabriel’s school.Leaving school at , Thomas admits that the academic world was not for him and he left home soon after to work in England.“School just wasn’t for me,” he explained.“I wasn’t academic but always fascinated by art and photos in newspapers and magazines such as The Observer and Sunday Times magazines.“I left home at  and went to England. There wasn’t much work here at the time and I just wanted to get away from Belfast with all the conflict going on.“I saw so much trouble and bloodshed on the streets. My community was under siege.“You couldn’t get in or out of Ardoyne without getting checked by British Army or RUC.“I was away for a year and worked in construction on building sites in London. I decided to come back because to be honest, I missed the place.“I didn’t really like London at all. It was far too quiet compared to back home.”Thomas ed to Belfast and turned his attention back to one of his hobbies and interests he had from a young age – photography.“I wanted to pursue a career in photography,” he added.“I went to night school where I learnt the basics but I wanted a job so I could work for the community using photography.“I managed to get an interview with the founder of Andersonstown News in West Belfast, Basil McLaughlin and Máirtín Ó Muilleoir who told me they were starting a new newspaper for North Belfast.“I was familiar with the Andersonstown News and liked the fact that they provided a voice for the community in West Belfast during the Troubles.“My interview was  years ago and I haven’t looked back since.”In  years, Thomas has established himself as a well-known and talented photographer and there wouldn’t be many in North Belfast who haven’t recognised him out and about doing the job he loves.Still, much has changed over the years in North Belfast and in photography.“North Belfast has changed in some ways but many issues remain today like housing and the unfair points system.“Community relations have improved with integrated education but even today, there are still sectarian attacks and peace walls remain up iding communities.“There are still people out there fighting for peace.“As for photography, I started off developing my own black and white images before it moved on to the digital age which takes up a lot less time and I can produce more photos.”Thomas has enjoyed many successes over the years and in , showcased  years of his work in the local media at an exhibition for Féile an Phobail.Back in May of this year, he scooped four awards at the Northern Ireland Press Photographers Awards, including first place in the Inidual Study and Sports Action categories along with a Provincial Merit Award. He has been recognised multiple times over the years in the awards.“It is great to be recognised for the daily work that I do. It is great for the North Belfast News and Belfast Media Group to show we put our best efforts into the product.“It was a proud moment for me and the paper.”Away from his daily working le, Thomas may also be seen on his motorcycle on the road and he also enjoys music. Thomas is also a busy grandad to two grandchildren and has three children – two daughters and a son.Asked for any advice for any budding photographers out there, Thomas would encourage them to join a camera club – the long-running CB Camera Club on the Antrim Road who meet every Thursday night at pm.As for the future, Thomas concluded, “I am content with the job I do now – representing people in the local community.“I am proud of where I am from. I want to see all young people succeed in what they are doing.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38047661.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/patch.jpg","title":"get ready for the transfer tests with the belfast telegraph and transfertests co uk","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Find out when the exams are and get the advice that the schools give out, but don’t waste your energy following rumours about what the grade is. It’s better to spend your time helping your child.It’s always worth practising. Whatever schools say, it’s worth it. Children can improve their performance by  -% by careful practice.Start earlyyou can, but don’t worryyou haven’t. Ideally it is best to start preparation for the Transfer Test exam at least one year ahead. However, don’t panicyou don’t have that much time even a few weeks can make a dference.Make a simple action plan. However long you’ve got, have a clear, simple strategy. There are two key principles: . Start from your child’s present level of knowledge. . Help your child to learn from their mistakes.Motivation, motivation, motivation! You have to take your child with you on this journey. A simple rewards system can be highly effective.Don’t just practice. There’s a tendency to think that just practising one test after anther will do the trick. It’s far more important to learn from mistakes. Going through the test afterwards with your child and filling in the the gaps in learning is crucial.Stay calm, manage stress, build confidence. Don’t talk about the Transfer test all the time. Use breaks, treats and bite-sized learning sessions to keep things fresh. Be realistic about your child’s potential. Pass or fail, it’s important to try to make this process a positive one.Manage the exam day. Make sure that you have everything ready for the day, that your child tries to get a good night’s sleep, eats breakfast and gets there in good time.How and when to use our testsIt’s best to use them as real exam practice. These tests are mock exams. They are set out in a style as close as possible to the real thing – though the format will y from year to year. It is best to use them as authentic exam experience rather than for general practice. Follow the instructions and advice in the sections before starting the test.What a score means and how to boost itIt is unfortunately impossible to say that a certain score can guarantee a pass in the actual exams. However, we suggest that a score of % would be a standard to aim at. It is important not to present this to your child as a concrete benchmark though, as the best motivator for them is to see the scores going up. Here are some tried and tested tips for improvement.Go over any incorrect answers. Always go over incorrect answers so that your child can see what went wrong. To help with this process, some of our harder Maths questions are explained.Use an action planner inside. This will provide a plan for what to do next when a test has been marked.Improve basic exam technique. Work on improving speed, working efficiently – coming back to trickier questions later – and pacing within the time limit.Improve general English skills. Ensure the foundations are strong enough. Use a range of checklists to help reinforce your child’s English skills.Target what is not fully understood. The secret is not to keep blindly practising but to target the areas of English Maths that your child is weakest in. This is where crucial marks can be picked up.Once your child has completed the papers you can download the corresponding answer sheets here:Answer sheets: Monday rd SeptemberAnswer sheets: Tuesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Wednesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Thursday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Friday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Saturday th SeptemberIf you would like to access the answer sheets for the transfer test practice papers from April May , you can access them here.Answer sheets: Monday th AprilAnswer sheets: Tuesday th AprilAnswer sheets: Wednesday st MayAnswer sheets: Thursday nd MayAnswer sheets: Friday rd MayAnswer sheets: Saturday th May"},{"url":null,"title":"all northern ireland paper 5 and 10 banknotes to be withdrawn from circulation","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And I think it was Gerry who was largely responsible for that because it was Gerry who sent me to America to get the Armalites.\"Adams, who refused to take part in the Spotlight series, has always denied that he was a member of the IRA and he has repeatedly said Brendan Hughes told lies about him.In the same programme about IRA gun-running, former missionary and parish priest Patrick Ryan has no such qualms about owning up to his part in the smuggling of weapons. data-dfpadtargetingBrendan Hughes with Gerry Adams in Long KeshDes LongPatrick Ryan talks to Jenner O’LearyThe BBC Spotlight reporter beside a DC, the type of aircraft used by the IRA to transport weaponsTipperary-born Ryan says Mrs Thatcher was right to link him to a series of IRA bomb attacks in England like Hyde Park and Brighton which almost killed the Prime Minister at the time.Asked about regrets, Ryan says: \"I have big regrets that I wasnt even more effective. But I didnt do too badly you know.\"Ryan claims that it was his discovery of a timing device which transformed the IRA bombing campaign and stopped terrorists blowing themselves up as they made their deadly bombs.Ryans admissions run contrary to what he told a Tipperary newspaper in  when he said he had raised cash for nationalist victims of the Troubles but had \"never bought explosives for the IRA or anybody \".In that year Ryan was arrested in Belgium and was sent back to Ireland but the Irish government infuriated Mrs Thatcher by refusing to extradite him to Britain.In Spotlight, Ryan says that at the start of the Troubles he took money from mission collection boxes to finance the situation in the north but was later approached by the organisations leaders to work for them permanently.\"They asked me to travel the world and try to get help for them,\" he says.The British government was convinced he was the main link between the IRA and Libyas Colonel Gaddafi who saw the Provos as comrades in arms.Ryan says of Gaddafi: \"He was a fine fella, the best I ever met. And we got on very well.\"Ryan says that in  the IRA dispatched him to Rome to meet their Chief of Staff Joe Cahill who went with him to Tripoli to meet Gaddafi who initially offered  tonnes of weaponry but later reduced the shipment on board the boat, the Claudia, to five tonnes because he suspected someone had blown the whistle.Veteran IRA man Des Long says Cahill had been told the boats owner was working with British intelligence.\"He was warned and warned and warned that the whole thing was gone,\" says Long, and the Claudia was captured off the Irish coast.Ryan however continued to travel all over Europe working for the IRA and he says he also spotted Memo Park timers which motorists were using to remind them when their car parking fees had run out.As footage is screened of terrorists making up a device, Ryan says he saw the timers as a means of preventing bombs going off while terrorists were arming them.Such was the scale of links between Libya and the IRA, the documentary makers say that in November  the Provos chartered a DC aircraft to fly  rocket launchers and  warheads from Libya to Shannon airport. Days later one of the rockets killed policeman Robert Keys in an attack on Belleek RUC station in Fermanagh."},{"url":null,"title":"irish government rejects claims it has misled public over border checks","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

crashes out of the EU at the end of October.On Sunday, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said that Brussels will insist on border checksthere is a no-deal Brexit, in order to preserve the interests of the European Union.Speaking in Dublin on Monday, Ms McEntee rejected suggestions that the Government has been “misleading”,the contingency plan to prevent a hard border is not in place.“What we’ve said in recent months, as it’s been looking more likely a no-deal is possible, there will have to be checks, they won’t be on the border, they cannot be a security threat,” she said.“TheCommission has been very clear in saying that the twin objectives are to do just that, ensure that there’s no infrastructure on the border, but also to protect us in the single market.“If you listen to Jean-Claude Juncker yesterday, what he said is that there will have to be checks, and we accept that.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Helen McEntee said the Government has been very honest “He also said that they could not be on the border, there could not be a hard border between North and South, and also that we cannot go back in history, that we cannot allow history to repeat itself.“We know what happened in the past when we had checks along the border and infrastructure along the border.“So anything that we’re doing now, particularly in the event of no-deal, will not replicate the backstop, it will not be as good as what we have negotiated now.“But it will hopefully meet the twin objectives to prevent border infrastructure and also to protect the single market and our place in it.”Her comments come as the Irish premier Leo Varadkar is due to meet British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday in New York.Mr Johnson, who has demanded that the backstop should be scrapped, met Mr Varadkar in Dublin two weeks ago.Ms McEntee said that Mr Varadkar will outline the Irish Government’s concerns.She added: “My understanding, and I think similar to their meeting two weeks ago, which was a very positive meeting, the Taoiseach will, yet again, outline our concerns, not just in terms of Brexit, but obviously the fact that we don’t have a ing Executive in Northern Ireland, which is crucial to all of this.“But he will also say that we are very willing, we’re very open and ready to accept any proposals that the UK may have, to replace or attempt to deal with  the backstop.“We know the papers were presented to the Commission last Thursday, they weren’t actual legal papers, they did not fulfil the same requirements as the backstop, so we need more.“There is still a huge gap between what we need and what has been presented by the UK, and in order to reach an agreement by October  we really do need to see more progress from the UK.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"department weighing medical school options","story":"The Department of Health is assessing the cost-effectiveness of locating a Medical School in Derry and said any final decision will require ministerial sign off.The Medical School forms part of Derry’s City Deal proposals and as such the local council is engaging with the UK government to see “ this project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.”The Ulster University has been for some time considering the development of a Graduate Entry Medical Schoolto be located in Derry and this project proposal features heavily in the Derry City  Strabane District Council’s economic regeneration plans for the region.With the support of the Local Council the University partners have been engaging with a number of NI Departments in an effort to progress this proposal.A spokesperson for UU confirmed that as part of its latest business case it aims to have its first academic year of enrolments for the GEMS in  .The Northern Ireland Department of Healthis acutely aware of the pressures on the medical workforce across Health and Social Careand its key role in leading the transformation of services set out in Delivering Together.Accordingly, DoH commissioned a Medical School Places Review, led by Professor Keith Gardiner, to determine the optimum number of medical school places that Northern Ireland requires per year. His report, published on  January , raises challenging, long-term, strategic and cross-cutting questions with major financial implications.Amongst other issues, it recommends expanding medical training places by at least  per year, potentially costing up to an additional £m per year when fully implemented. This report is a key consideration of UU in putting forward its proposal for a medical school in Derry.While DoH has been assisting UU in the development of its Outline Business Casefor a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee Campus, this is separate from any decision on medical student expansion in Northern Ireland. Feedback was provided on  July  to the fourth iteration of the OBC.Any commissioning of additional medical places for Northern Ireland must address comprehensively the full range of available options, with a particular focus on the assessment of value for money and affordability for health and social care, the report says.“For example, rather than simply expanding medical student numbers, it will be important to explore lower-cost measures likely to increase the supply of medics over the short-term and which enhance and maximise the signicant investment currently being made in undergraduate medical education.“DoH is developing a business case to consider these matters. Given the cross-cutting nature and potential for signicant associated costs with the Medical School business case, the DoH Permanent Secretary has advised that any decision on this or other long-term options, must be considered by Northern Ireland Executive Ministers.”It added: “The provision of HE places in NI or the establishment of a medical school in Derry is a devolved matter, however, the Derry  Strabane City District Council is presently engaging with UKG to considerthis project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.“The medical school is one part of a wider package of proposals currently under consideration with other draft proposals included that could complement existing specialties at the Magee Campus.“The development of the Council’s final bids for a City Deal from the Inclusive Future Fund is still ongoing and as of August , there has been no official final bid submitted for either funding stream to UKG, including no formal bid to provide funding to a Derry medical school.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: projected image of what Magee will look likeexpanded with Graduate Entry Medical School by the riverfront."},{"url":null,"title":"derry trades union council calls public back youth climate strike","story":"Derry Trades Union Council have said they are to stand with the Youth Strike  Climate Derry organisation this Friday fighting for climate justice.DTUC have called on everyone to mobilise on September  and attend the Youth Strike  Climate Rally, Guildhall Square, for pm.Niall McCarroll, Chairman of DTUC said: \"Young people today are both politically and environmentally aware, the young people organising this event are an inspiration and deserve huge credit for this campaign, however, for any campaign to success it needs support and a radical mass mobilization to get behind the campaign objectives.We need to fight for our planets survival but we also need to look at our habits as humans and the damage our le choices and lestyles are creating.\"More than  percent of the Amazon rainforest is already gone, and much more is severely threatened as the destruction continues.

This is much too important an issue.The momentum is with the North West and with the campaign for an independent university."},{"url":null,"title":"government report casts doubt magee expansion","story":"A report published by the Secretary of State for NI has cast further doubt over expansion at Magee by raising a number of concernsThe report states that in , DfE received a joint proposal from Ulster Universityand Council for a scaled expansion of the University’s Magee Campus to , full-time students from its existing ,, as well as an additional  full time students delivered via the North West Regional College .The proposition was the delivery of an increased supply of skilled graduates, togetherwith regional benefits that could flow to the North West.Planned expansion of the university campus is largely dependent on City Deal funding.At a recent Council meeting, it was revealed that projects linked to Ulster University will receive £m, at least a third of the City Deal funding, which currently stands at £m but is projected to be £m-£m with the Council expected to contribute £m and other partners making up the shortfall.The UU projects include the Graduate Entry Medical School, whose financial viability has been cast into doubt by Head of the NI Civil Service David Sterling. Alongside that are centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automationand a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence .Julian Smiths report says the proposals to expand Magee had signicant funding consequences from a capital infrastructure perspective, approximately £m, and from a resource funding perspective.The proposal would require Higher Education in NI to be placed on a sustainable footing, comparable with England, from which expansion would take place.According to the report, there would also be, as with any requested expansion or increase to student numbers, resource grant consequences of funding the proposed additional places at UU and NWRC, and associated student support costs, circa £m.\"The £m capital cost was highly indicative and based on an assumed cost per square metre per student.\"The Department for the Economyundertook initial work to determine how it would look at the case,there was an agreement on how the sector as a whole could be sustainably funded, as any expansion in student numbers would not make sense without this in place,\" it said.In February , DfE wrote to, and is awaiting a response from, UU requesting that an update be made to the case, according to the report.DfE asked for a more accurate assessment of capital need, which was \"very theoretical\" in the original proposal and created a signicant cost requirement. It wants a review of the number and subject level mix of additional students required to ensure an underpinning alignment with graduate postgraduate economic need in subject areas proposed.Furthermore, the department requested information around phasing of the project to assessthere are \"more suitable break points\" in the proposal and a potential to scale any expansion both in terms of student numbers and capital development.And sought the \"rationale\" for locating additional higher education places in the Magee Campus, as opposed to other geographical locations with further and more detailed explanation in relation to sub-regional economic benefits.This information will be critical to enabling a strategic approach to HE provision and in feeding into any final business case that might be put forward for this proposal, it concluded.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt based actor blown away role movie linked jurassic world franchise","story":"By Cathal McGuiganA Magherafelt-based actor has said he was “blown away” when he learned he had been cast in Battle at Big Rock, a short film thats part of the Jurassic World franchise.Chris Finlaysonplays American biker Greg in the film and aims to build on this role and some experience as an extra to land more acting roles.Battle at Big Rock was posted to Youtube on Sunday and had been viewed more than three million times by Thursday evening. Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ulster university responds questions regarding city deal funds medical school","story":"The Derry News posed a number of questions to Ulster Universityover the continued uncertainty on the establishment of a Medical School at Magee College.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshFirstly, we asked does UU have any update or response regarding the medical school and concerns raised by David Sterling around the need for ongoing funding which UU is not prepared to invest   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Following cross-party political and health and social care support in  for Ulster University’s Graduate Entry Medical School, the University has continued to proactively develop the project, working closely with the Department and other relevant partners. Our responses to any remaining clarications within the Graduate Entry Medical School business case were submitted to the Department of Health at the start of July, following prompt and close engagement with the Department and other relevant partners. Our proposed first academic year of projected enrolments outlined within the updated business case is  .“As the Department of Health has previously confirmed that any decision on funding can only be made by Ministers, the University is not actively recruiting medical students as yet for  entry until that decision on funding can be reached.· If funding was confirmed, all other elements of the proposal for our medical undergraduate degree programme have been firmly on track including continued progress with the GMC, clinical placement opportunities and the development of a curriculum to meet the needs of healthcare locally.“We value the continued support of all those who share our vision for medical education and we continue to work with the General Medical Council, St George’s University of London and local clinicians and partners building on our existing leadership in medical and healthcare provision to take forward graduate entry medical education for Northern Ireland.\"What does UU say in response to local councillors representatives who have claimed that UU has neglected the Magee campus for decades and should not be given money as part of the City Deal but should instead invest its own money in Derry   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Ulster University continues to invest in the Magee campus, most recently with the state-of-the-art £m teaching block which signals our ambition for higher education in the city, already enhancing campus le and paving the way for enhanced future capacity at Magee.    This and other investment priorities for students have resulted in a very strong performance for the Magee campus across all elements of the  National Student Survey, reflecting the very positive reaction from our students to these recent investments in University le at Magee.  With all four faculties of the University represented on the Magee campus – across health sciences, arts and humanities, business and computing and engineering, we are pushing boundaries and breaking new ground in emerging sectors as a progressive university, shortlisted for the prestigious Times Higher Education University of the Year Award, .“Our contribution to the City Deal opportunity is a signicant step forward in our collective opportunity to realise the full ambitions of this vibrant university city.  Our City Deals proposal will see us apply our expertise to help maximize the city’s potential in this unparalleled opportunity to boost economic growth and prosperity.  In our continued collaboration with industry partners, we look forward to driving innovation in personalised medicine, cognitive analytics, robotics and automation, leading to both new research posts and learning opportunities for additional students.  The proposed riverfront innovation hub will build upon the expertise of our first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus, and which cemented our reputation as a global leader in this field. Also integral to the City Deal remains our commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point.   City Deal recognises the crucial role our University can play as an economic engine in the North West and is a major boost to the collective ambitions of the city and region.  We look forward to the development of our projects in partnership with industry, civic and educational partners.\"How much money will be needed in total to fund the projects put forward as part of the City Deal A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"The funding contributions by project across City Deal and the Inclusive Futures Funds are indicative at this stage, based on the allocations provided by Council, and subject to adjustment as we go forward.  Our contribution of % University funding to the Magee projects within City Deal reflects our belief in the impact they will make, and our commitment to playing our part in the collective ambitions of City Deal.“City Deal enables us to build further on our academic strengths that are signicant for the region’s growth, and to make sure that this expertise across world class research and progressive student learning works hard for the benefit of all in the city region. The City Deal bid has education, innovation, job creation and skills development at its core and each of these priorities are also central to our work across both teaching and research.  We are therefore a natural fit and a committed partner in this ambitious bid.  A continued

The upgrading of the pitch is certainly sustainable financially, given the amount of usage it would get.ldquoWe have lost  teams to other leagues in the past few years and they have all cited poor facilities as their main reason for moving to play in the the Lisburn or South Belfast Leagues, he added.Mr Torney said it was essential that proper facilities were put in place to enable the league to avoid weekly postponements of games.ldquoWe are left every year with a fixture congestion because of postponements and in order to arrest the haemorrhaging of clubs from the league we must address this issue immediately.The league are being supported by South Down MP Chris Hazzard, who has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ldquofinally deliver fit for purpose pitches for the local community in Downpatrick.He continued: ldquoThe current provision of sports pitches at Dunleath Park is nothing short of a disgrace.ldquoDunleath Park is used extensively by the Downpatrick Youth Football League with hundreds of young footballers playing each weekend, but yet againthis week, parts of the pitches have been closed to the public as raw sewage has come to the surface.ldquoIt is an absolute shame that in the shadow of our fantastic new leisure centre here in Downpatrick our local young people are expected to make do with substandard pitches that not only flood for most of the winter months, but are regularly polluted with raw sewage.Mr Hazzard believes that Downpatrick deserves much better treatment.ldquoAs the county town, Downpatrick deserves to have the very best in local sports provision, and that simply isnrsquot the case at the moment.ldquoIt is deeply disappointing that so many of our young footballers are left to travel to Lisburn and Belfast each weekend to play football. That must not be allowed to continue.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWhilst there is no getting away from the fact that Dunleath Park is in a flood plain area, I would have sympathy with local sports clubs that feel that this is too easily put up as a hurdle to any investment, and that the council should actively consider a range of solutions in order to deliver suitable facilities.ldquoI want to thank those local sports clubs and Downpatrick Youth League representatives who continue to work tirelessly in order to provide local sporting opportunities for our young people and I will now be making representation to senior council management in order to make all their voices heard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan forest cycle in the park family event in aid of Knockevin Special School  ","story":"ALL roads lead to Castlewellan Forest Park this Sunday for a special event to raise money for Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and celebrate the benefits of cycling for everyone.The lsquocycle in the parkrsquo event is being organised by the schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association to raise funds to help purchase new bikes for pupils to help them experience nature and the great outdoors.Sundayrsquos all ability event mdash which runs from am until pm ndash is being billed as a celebration of cycling and will have something for families and special needs adventurers, hard core mountain bikers, club riders, children and young people.The event is being hosted by the Kilmegan Velo Cycling Club with its chairman, Sean Warnock, inviting all cyclists to make their way to the forest park for the event.He said: ldquoThe aim is to get families and friends to experience cycling in a safe setting but full of adventure and we have events for all abilities.ldquoThere will be family trail quests, agility skills for kids, a full time-trial on the red trails, special needs bikes and a Sunday club fuel stop.

Title deeds, usually the easiest of documents to trace, have become impossible to track down.Three people are laying claim to the pier alone and a legal row is pending about whether a contract was broken over the sale of pier some time ago.Against this backcloth, Down council official have been trying to bring the harbour into public ownership since the publication of the Governmentrsquos cash-help promise in July .

A corporate body has almost been directed to include a political representative on its deputation. This will create tensions which this council and district can do without.Mr Sean Quinnthought it was ldquorather arrogant of the minister to make the suggestion and he believed that Mr Powell was like previous South Down MPs, who, he said, had not satisfactorily served the constituency.Official Unionist councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, said she would resent it as much as anybodyshe felt the councilrsquos powers were being usurped, but on this occasion she thought it was only natural that Mr Powell should join the deputation.She told councillors: ldquoMr Powell has worked consistently very hard for all sections of the community and nobody could accuse him of working for one party or another.

time.Recently, residents were asked for their input into this particular scheme which focuses on landscape and civil engineering improvements.Specialist consultants have been appointed to design and deliver the scheme in the heart of the town with a specic focus on Market Square, Castle Street, Ferry Street, High Street and Meeting House Street.The aim of the scheme is to create a safe and attractive route for pedestrians through the town as well as one that celebrates and interprets Portaferryrsquos local history and architectural heritage.Planned public realm improvements include widening footpaths, creating better pedestrian connectivity, improving street lighting, resurfacing footpaths, enhanced street furniture, possible traffic flow improvement and new tree and shrub planting.Other improvements include redesigning the Market Square car park and the use of high quality, natural stone in the Market Square and adjacent streets.A pre-application community consultation event was held in Portaferry three weeks ago and it is hoped that a formal application paving the way for work to start will be submitted in October, with the green light for work to start expected as early as next February.Technical design and procurement is is expected to take up to eight months to complete with contractors on site in September next year.Council officials have suggested that construction work could take up to nine months to complete and thatall the pieces in the development jigsaw fall into place, the public realm scheme could conclude in May .Last week,  responses to the planned public realm scheme were handed over to Ards and North Down Council officials by Portaferry resident Colm McCarthy who was joined by Strangford MP Jim Shannon.He thanked Mr McCarthy for gathering the huge number of responses and explained the resident will be meeting with senior council officials to discuss the planned scheme further.ldquoIt is essential that when public money is

We appreciate that while this may only be the start of the process, we would call on the landowners to talk to us and the local council.Mr Gardiner added: ldquoOur door is open and we are happy to chat. We very much view ourselves as good neighbours. We hope that moving forward agreement can be reached.Since , work has progressed and a number of studies completed in an effort to advance the planned railway extension, including the completion of a revised business case, along a disused section of line.Council officials argue that the planned extension would help the local authority meet of one its key objectives in transforming the district into one of Irelandrsquos premier tourist destinations and help attract and promote economic investment, enhancing the visitor experience.In addition, council officials are confident that extending the heritage railway line would assist with the regeneration of a rural area.The local authority said attempts to negotiate a settlement with three landowners at the Ballydugan end of the railway line had not been successful.As a result, the local authorityrsquos lawyers are to be asked to proceed with a vesting application to allow heritage railway officials to progress discussions with prospective project funders.Downpatrick councillors Cadogan Enright and Dermot Curran have welcomed the proposal to vest the land.Cllr Enright mdash who formally proposed that the vesting process should commence mdash said the former Down Council earmarked finance to acquire the land to pave the way for the railwayrsquos extension.He said given the inability to persuade current owners of unused track bed toit to public ownership ldquovesting has become necessary.Cllr Enright added: ldquoWe have been trying to get this done voluntarily for the past  years and more and I am delighted that the Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee is backing the proposal to proceed with vesting.Cllr Curran said the local railway had been a ldquomajor success since it opened and had managed to secured hundreds of thousands of pounds in funding from a iety of sources to provide an attraction which is second to none.ldquoThe railway is one of the most popular attractions of its kind in Northern Ireland and has had ambitious expansion plans on the table for some time, he continued.ldquoThe local authority has put tourism at the top of its agenda and extending the railway, I believe, would be a major boost for the area.

The work is scheduled to last five weeks.Major concerns voiced by residents and local politicians about pedestrian safety at this part of the resort mdash where there have been countless near misses particularly at the Dundrum Road side of the roundabout mdash prompted roads officials to act. Some pedestrians have also been struck by vehicles.The provision of new puffin crossings will result in traffic lights being provided either side of the roundabout, with the move welcomed by Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke.He described the provision of the new crossings as a ldquolong overdue priority for pedestrian safety in Newcastle explaining that they will help reduce pedestrian collisions and near misses at a particularly busy part of the resort.ldquoAlong with other elected representatives, community and residentsrsquo groups, the local Policing and Community Safety Partnership and the public I have campaigned for the replacement of the zebra crossing with a controlled lights crossing, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoI have campaigned for this road safety measure for over a decade and am delighted work has started this week.

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven. That was something we had planned.“I’d said to Kirsty I wanted to do something dferent, maybe a little random act of kindness to share a little joy.

He said: “He was a fine fella. One of the best I ever met. We got on very well.”Ryan had been a Catholic missionary in east Africa but was back in Ireland working as a parish priest when the Troubles began at the end of the s.He said that he financially contributed “as much help as I could – some of it out of the mission boxes – to the situation up north” and then was “approached by some of the IRA leaders down here [to ask]perchance I could work for them permanently. They asked me to travel the world and try to get help for them.”Ryan eventually fell out with the church and left the Pallottine order in .That year he was instrumental in securing a five-tonne shipment of weaponry from Tripoli but it was intercepted before arriving in Ireland. He said that the original plan had been for a -tonne shipment but that at the last minute the load had been slashed by the Libyan authorities for reasons which were never explained to him.No Deal Brexit: As many , people in Republic of Ireland with U.K. driving licence could be driving illegally Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It was Ryan who realised that a gadget used in continental Europe to remind drivers toto their cars before their parking tickets ran out could be used as timers in bombs.Hundreds of the Memopark timers were bought by the former priest on the continent and sent to the UK or Ireland for IRA use.The fragments of a Memopark timer was recovered from the rubble of the Brighton Hotel bombing which almost killed Margaret Thatcher in  and did kill five others, as well as injuring more than , some very seriously.In a declassied government document, Margaret Thatcher was shown to have described Ryan as “a very dangerous man” who had “an expert knowledge of bombing” and had been the key conduit between the IRA and Libya for over a decade.When Mrs Thatcher’s accusations were put to him and he was askedhe was involved in any of those incidents, he said: “I would say most of them one way or another, I had a hand in most of them. Yes, she was right.”Askedshe was right to link him to bombs such as Hyde Park and Brighton, he said: “Absolutely – %. Oh yes.”When askedhe had any regrets, he said: “Oh, I have, yes. Big regrets. Of what nature  I regret that I wasn’t even more effective. Oh yes absolutely. I’d like to have been even more effective than I actually was.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their free dog welfare workshops, delivered as part of the Charity’s ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, enhance the National Curriculum and seek to provide children between the ages of seven and  years with the knowledge and understanding they need to act responsibly and safely around dogs in their homes and those they may see out and about.Each workshop benefits pupils by involving a pretend dog as its focus, with the aim of developing compassion and consideration for all living beings.Not only do children - whether dog owners or not - learn how to behave safely around dogs, they also learn all about the commitment involved in owning a dog through a creative and interactive learning experience.Last year, Cathy Clyde, Dogs Trust’s NI Education and Community Officer delivered workshops to , children. This year they are on track to improve on this number yet again. With the growing success of the ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, Dogs Trust now employs  education and community officers across the UK to provide workshops in their designated regions.Cathy said: “Through debate and discussion, our responsible dog ownership workshops encourage learners to embody important values around dog ownership such choosing the right breed or type of dog for your le style, as well as understanding that dogs are a lelong commitment and not a disposable commodity. I would welcome the opportunity to work with schools in the area and encourage them to get in touch, as pupils really do get a lot out of the workshops as do their dogs.”For more information about ‘Be Dog Smart’ visit www.bedogsmart.org.ukFor more information or to book a ‘Be Dog Smart’ workshop, contact Cathy Clyde on    or email cathy.clyde@dogstrust.org.ukTwo arrested after police chase

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glyn_121.jpg","title":"ni business leaders to outline major job creation plan at downing street and westminster","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland industry leaders will outline their plans to create tens of thousands of new jobs to Downing Street, hundreds of MPs and company leaders today as part of a major business delegation visiting London. Trade NI – the new alliance between Hospitality Ulster, Manufacturing NI and Retail NI – is unveiling a -year plan called ‘Vision ’ at a Westminster reception on Wednesday afternoon, as the UK’s political system enters its most volatile period in a generation. With just weeks before the UK is expected to leave the EU, more than  guests are confirmed to attend the event that will be addressed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith MP and the shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd MP. Business leaders are also due to attend a later event at Downing Street, and a lunch at the Irish Embassy. Trade NI’s “transformative economic plan” will set out key policy priorities that have the potential to create , jobs and to make Northern Ireland a high growth economy. In a joint statement, Trade NIs Colin Neill , Stephen Kellyand Glyn Roberts , said: “Northern Ireland is facing a huge challenge as it struggles politically and economically with a growth forecast of around % or below. This is simply not good enough and we can’t sit idly by and let events overtake us. We must break the cycle of limited economic growth.” “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “We need to be bold and ambitious about creating % or even % growth over the next few years, but that requires decision makers to be pressed into action and a series of policy and legislative decisions to be taken and driven through. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy. We want to make Northern Ireland the best place in the UK and Ireland to shop, socialise, locate and start a business “The Vision  plan sets out to create a better ing business environment and attract further inward investment that will lead to a revitalised economy taking on the challenge in turbulent times.” “We want to make Northern Ireland an eco-system of innovation.Trade NI is keen to work with all business organisations, chambers of commerce, trade unions and voluntary sector representation to create a new progressive partnership for change in Northern Ireland.” And Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, sponsor of Trade NI’s Westminster reception, said: Danske Bank is proud to be one of the main sponsors of Trade NI’s Westminster reception. Trade NI is seizing the initiative and ensuring that the voice of the local business community is being heard loud and clear at a time of upheaval and uncertainty.” “The vibrancy of the Northern Ireland private sector is imperative to the strength of our economy and we need to ensure that local businesses are protected and well positioned to be able to compete globally in the post-Brexit environment.” Emma Gilthorpe, executive director, Heathrow Expansion, said: “Heathrow is delighted to support the launch of Trade NI, echoing Heathrow’s commitment to connect Northern Ireland to global growth and to share the benefits of an expanded Heathrow with the businesses and communities of Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/air_1221.jpg","title":"belfast city airport named airport of the year","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by Ulster Business Belfast City Airport has been named ‘airport of the year’ at an international aviation industry event.
