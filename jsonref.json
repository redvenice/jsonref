But albino rabbits don’t like harsh climates. They didn’t last the winter’My father is a Tibetan lama. When he was still just a baby, he was recognised as a tulku, a reincarnation of a Tibetan Buddhist teacher. He lives in the UK now. He met my mother in Dalhousie, India, when she was teaching English to Tibetan refugees. They fell in love and he gave up his monastic vows, but being a tulku isn’t something you can give up. It is who you are.He is still the head of a monastery in Kham, Qinghai, so when we are there, it’s a busy time – we get invited to a lot of houses. I was seven the first time I went. As an adult, I started going back regularly, to see friends and family. I always take my camera. I have been photographing Lhamo Tsertso and Lobsang Chödron, the daughters of a close family friend, since they were two or three. I have made portraits of them every year that I’ve been back since. They’re 19 now.Twins are an obvious subject for photographers but, as the project has stretched over such a long period, it has evolved into something more. The girls have grown and changed with the environment around them, yet the resemblance between the two remains constant. In this portrait they were 15. When I arrived with my camera, they rushed off to their room to get changed. But they were gone for about half an hour, which felt very different from the previous years.Before, they would just stand there, not bothered by the process. This time, they came out wearing these incredible gingham dresses, reminding me of Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz. They had matching watches and they’d done their hair. It felt like a real transition: they’d started to become aware of how they were presenting themselves. We went out on to the balcony and, after a few shots, they picked up their rabbits. They had just celebrated their birthdays, and their father had bought them these albino rabbits as a gift. And there it was, the shot.Tibet is very rich in colour, lots of bright reds and greens. I’ve taken a lot of photographs in monasteries with monks and nuns wearing deep shades of maroon. So the colour palette here is unusual. The girls’ father is an architect, and they live in a town that was levelled by an earthquake in 2010. This is at their new house and the surrounding area was still quite dusty from building work. It was summer, too, and, being at 12,000ft, the light is crisp, harsh even. That’s why I always shoot on film. Digital just doesn’t do it justice. You can’t get the black tones in the shadows, or the bright highlights of the sun. Only film can handle the contrasts between the two.The rabbits speak to the Chinese influence, a sign of how things are changing. The concept of a pet rabbit is so foreign to the traditional nomadic way of life. Life was simple and, until recently, if you owned an animal in Kham, it had to have had some sort of purpose. A dri (female yak) will produce milk, butter, yoghurt, meat, fur, wool and glue (from the hooves) – none of the animal is wasted if it dies. People have such a respect for life and an awareness of death. Albino rabbits don’t like harsh climates – I don’t think they are able to survive temperatures as low as -10C. These rabbits didn’t last the winter.The girls speak Chinese to each other, and to their father, and Tibetan to their mother. I speak a Khampa dialect, a colloquial Tibetan with a strong accent. Someone once told me they could almost place my accent to the mountain on which I’d learned the language.Kham is one of the most beautiful places on Earth. You have no idea how many stars there are until you’ve seen the night sky above the plateau. But it is the people, not the place, that keep me going back: my family, my friends. Some of the best nights of my life have been sitting in my father’s small room at the top of the monastery with the monks and my family, just chatting and cracking up, real belly laughs. The time we have there is very special.Trained: BA Photographic Arts, University of Westminster.Influences: “My dad and, photographically, Mary Ellen Mark who made such emotive work, focusing on the margins of society, finding beauty in her subjects and presenting them with dignity.

She said she was already shopping for vulnerable people in her village who were significantly younger.Vickers is not the first public figure to talk about a policy of deliberate infection. Although in a different context, a senior Formula One chief revealed last month that he suggested the team’s drivers should try to become infected with coronavirus as it is the “ideal time”, as the season is on hold.Helmut Marko, Red Bull’s head of driver development, said: “We have four Formula One drivers and eight or 10 juniors. The idea was to organise a camp where we could bridge this mentally and physically somewhat dead time and that would be the ideal time for the infection to come.”Cummings, who has been self-isolating after reportedly developing coronavirus-type symptoms, has been keeping a low profile. Downing Street has rejected as “a highly defamatory fabrication” a claim that he initially argued against strict measures to contain coronavirus.A report in the Sunday Times claimed that at one private event at the end of February, Cummings outlined the government’s strategy at the time in a way that was summarised by some present as “herd immunity, protect the economy, and if that means some pensioners die, too bad”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85f5790e91dda66d7e9d70ff0c92b25ecb12b991/13_178_5213_3128/master/5213..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c61ab464235e4c4cd8f3f6153d3136a","title":"online price cough medicine soars since uk lockdown","story":"ONS report on cost of high-demand items adds to pressure on retailers over price hikesGovernment to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms.

Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of £25,000.Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by £1,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits.Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above £94.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.The ONS said the products, which also included toilet rolls, handwash and long-life milk, were chosen using anecdotal evidence of goods for which there was increased demand from consumers during the early stage of the pandemic. “Prices were scraped from a number of UK retailers,” it said.Some products that sold quickly as the UK lockdown began were recorded by the ONS as falling in price, including dried pasta and antibacterial surface wipes.Retailers have come under fire from consumer groups for increasing the cost of goods in high demand, though chemists and local shops are understood to have blamed distributors for some price increases, while producers have claimed they faced an increase in the cost of raw materials.The report also showed that the virus was having a dramatic impact on the British labour market. More than a quarter of businesses told the ONS they were laying off staff after a collapse in revenues.The employment figures, which were predominantly recorded before the lockdown, also show the pandemic affected trade at more than half of firms importing or exporting goods.The survey was part of a new fortnightly release of data related to the pandemic. The ONS said: “These are experimental statistics and have been developed to provide early indicators of the impact of Covid-19 in a timely way.”Nye Cominetti, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said the mass lay-offs helped to explain why almost 1 million people had made a universal credit claim in the past fortnight.“With almost half of firms saying they have been impacted negatively by the crisis, we can expect further job losses in the near future,” she said.“The government’s welcome coronavirus job retention scheme will make a big difference to some workers who may have otherwise lost jobs.“But huge numbers of people are still going to be facing big income hits, and difficult times lie ahead for many.

As she says: “I had my first drink at age nine, began smoking marijuana at 10, and at 12 took up cocaine.”Bette Davis published this autobiography in the 60s, at the end of her great period, and updated it in the 1980s – after her daughter BD Hyman published a Mommie Dearest-type memoir of her – detailing her life and times, with true leading-lady hauteur rising above the general awfulness and the fallout from four fraught marriages.This bestseller from the golden-age legend Mary Astor recounted one of Hollywood’s most scandalised lives. In 1936, she was orced, after an affair with the dramatist George S Kaufman, and the press coverage became obsessed with her diary, which supposedly chronicled her sexual adventures. Much argued about in court, the diary was impounded in a bank vault and finally burnt.Art Linson (the producer of Fight Club) gives an amusing account of the unendingly humiliating business of a life spent trying to get movies made – there is a wince-inducing anecdote of trying to persuade Alec Baldwin to go back into his trailer and shave off the inappropriate straggly beard he had grown just before filming. Linson describes the process of sucking up to powerful people as “bog snorkelling” and “grabbing the knee pads”.The fatale screen-goddess’s autobiography was written towards the end of her life, hitting back at her reputation for being difficult and recounting her professional partnerships with Joel McCrea and Alan Ladd – and with her legendary, lustrous hair, which she had to cut during the second world war to deter female factory workers from copying it.Mia Farrow’s autobiography was widely praised for her eloquent memoirs, recounting her troubled family life and her relationships with Frank Sinatra, André Previn and most dramatically of all, Woody Allen. The book was published five years after she first made public allegations that he had sexually molested seven-year-old Dylan, which he has consistently denied, which were investigated by the authorities and for which no charges were brought.The suave and mellifluous actor’s memoir sported jovially with his onscreen reputation, recounting his remarkable early life in Russia, his character-acting adventures in Hollywood and his marriage to Zsa Zsa Gabor. Written before his slide into ill-health and depression, it maintains a dapper jauntiness.It was the courage and uncompromising commitment of Rose McGowan that formed the arrowhead of the #MeToo movement and the campaign to bring Harvey Weinstein to book. Part of what this memoir does is tell us what lies beneath a lot of Hollywood’s racy anecdotes and gossip: a world of abuse and bad faith.The producer Julia Phillips became the first woman to get a best picture Oscar with The Sting in 1973 and she was a driving force behind Taxi Driver in 1976 – but it was this tell-all book about the cocaine-fuelled, vanity-charged horror of Hollywood that made her a legend. (Cocaine use bankrupted Phillips.) David Geffen, Steven Spielberg and Richard Dreyfuss came off as ego-addled narcissists and the book so infuriated the industry that she really was banned from Morton’s, the A-listers’ restaurant.Michael Caine’s three books of autobiography and his meandering thoughts on the acting craft give us his life from his beginnings as Maurice Micklewhite from a working-class family to his success in Swinging London and his breakthrough roles in Alfie, Zulu and The Italian Job. He recounts a legendary meeting with John Wayne in the lobby of a Hollywood hotel who advised him: “Talk low, talk slow, and don’t say much”. Perhaps Caine’s legendary delivery really is the Brit version of Wayne.In the 50s, Tab Hunter was an impossibly gorgeous slice of B-movie beefcake, a sexy actor and singer for whom Jack Warner created Warner Bros Records. Hunter tells us how, despite being intensively marketed to swooning women, he in fact preferred men, in an era in which homophobic paranoia went hand-in-hand with red-baiting – and had affairs with Anthony Perkins and the figure-skater Ronnie Robertson.Katharine Hepburn’s garrulous, wayward memoir is a fluent and engaging but scattershot performance (in which you can clearly imagine the famous quavering Bryn Mawr voice) perhaps designed to keep at bay those who would take too close an interest in her private life. She handles tactfully her relationships with Howard Hughes and her legendary co-star Spencer Tracy, and gives nothing to those readers who believed that she was gay.A massive bestseller in its day, with an aspirational title that is sometimes mockingly extended with “… if Frank Sinatra says it’s OK” in honour of the line from This Is Spinal Tap about his perceived subservient position to Ol’ Blue Eyes in the Las Vegas Rat Pack. Despite the conservatism of his later years, when he endorsed the presidency of Richard Nixon, his battle against racism is stirring. There is an extraordinary, Ballardian description of how he lost his eye in a car accident – it fell prey to the bullet-shaped horn button on the steering wheel of his 1954 Cadillac. Davis gallantly helped the other driver out of her car with the eye still dangling out of its socket.Chaplin brought a richly Dickensian flair to this autobiography: with the same mix of sadness, sentimentality, humour and warmth that formed the bedrock of the Hollywood storytelling style he pioneered. He gave it to us in three acts: the grinding poverty in London the staggering success in Hollywood and then the chilly anti-communist cold shoulder and final retreat to that well-known leftwing enclave, Switzerland. Chaplin name-checks grand acquaintances such as the Prince of Wales, but he isn’t big on acknowledging other silent-movie greats and is reticent about his love life.Boorman, one of many movie directors who turn out to be beautiful writers as well, vividly and disarmingly describes his childhood in south London and then in Ireland with the kind of engagement that he would show in his great personal film Hope and Glory. He gets his start making documentaries at the BBC, and then there are his experiences in Hollywood dealing with the fragile egos of Burt Reynolds, Richard Burton and Marlon Brando, who pointedly told Boorman what Michael Winner had said to him: “You are a great actor, I am not a great director, please do whatever you like.”The impossibly handsome Tony Curtis matured from being a B-movie swashbuckler into a brilliant dramatic and comic actor. After a depiction of his tough upbringing in the Bronx, New York, he gives a seductive view of the Hollywood playground, and his meetings with Laurence Olivier, Frank Sinatra and Billy Wilder. His subsequent book detailed the making of Some Like It Hot and his complex relationship with Monroe, with whom he had had a relationship that flowered again during filming (he was married to Janet Leigh, she to Arthur Miller). This resulted in a pregnancy that miscarried.Towards the end of her life, Louise Brooks revealed herself to be a great writer about the film business and this memoir, published when she was 78, cemented her reputation. Like so many stories of early Hollywood, it is the story of an inventor and a pioneer, someone who helped create a whole language now taken for granted. After her dull Kansas childhood, Brooks came to New York in the 1920s as a dancer and made the acquaintance of Walter Wanger, Herman Mankiewicz and Charlie Chaplin, but found greatness in Europe with the Austrian director GW Pabst. Her glossy bob hairstyle became a daring sexual brand identity, but this strong, vital woman found herself frozen out of Hollywood by its tetchy menfolk.Kirk Douglas’s story of his rise to greatness in the Hollywood golden age with movies including Champion, Spartacus, Paths of Glory and Ace in the Hole is a compelling read, for the blistering energy (reproduced in his prose) with which he strove to get away from his former poverty, and his rage at himself for not having confronted the antisemites earlier in his life. Despite his 65-year marriage, Douglas was serially unfaithful, and the book is naive about sexual politics, but there are some ripe stories about his relationships with Rita Hayworth, Marlene Dietrich and Joan Crawford. While lovemaking on her rug, Crawford disconcertingly murmured to him: “You’re so clean. It’s wonderful that you shaved your armpits when you made Champion.”Lauren Bacall describes her career on Broadway and in Hollywood, her marriages to Humphrey Bogart and Jason Robards, and her affair with Frank Sinatra (who features as anecdote fodder in so many of the books about this period). She was a Jewish girl dreaming of being like Bette Davis, and made her mark first as a fashion model who caught the attention of Howard Hawks who cast her in To Have And Have Not, where she began an affair with Bogart, her married co-star, who was 25 years older – although their subsequent marriage was very happy. This was the love of Bacall’s life.Co-written with the seasoned Hollywood ghostwriter Earl Conrad, this book was completed just before the death of the singing and acting star Dandridge, the first African-American to receive a best actress Oscar nomination (for Carmen Jones in 1954). She was a pioneering activist who had to contend with sexism and racism, and her career – after the sensational Carmen Jones – was hampered by her lover and director Otto Preminger, who told her to accept only leading roles. This was well-meaning but ill-judged advice. She was a campaigner with the NAACP and introduced Martin Luther King Jr at one event.These two parts of Michael Powell’s autobiography – he was the legendary director who worked with Emeric Pressburger – are an essential account of cinephilia and movie creativity. His is a compelling story of his early career in silent movies, working with Rex Ingram and then Alfred Hitchcock, his later collaboration with Pressburger and then the passionate admiration of Martin Scorsese, which effectively relaunched his reputation in the 1970s. Powell writes simply but rather movingly about falling in love with Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese’s brilliant editor, and their subsequent marriage.Made into a movie in 2002, this memoir from the legendary actor-turned-Paramount producer is a great Hollywood insider tell-all, with a title quoting Darryl Zanuck’s remark when some of Evans’s erstwhile acting colleagues demanded he be fired from the 1957 film The Sun Also Rises. He was married many times, including to the Love Story star Ali MacGraw, and as a producer, he was the driving force behind Love Story, Rosemary’s Baby, Chinatown and The Godfather – but also the notorious flop, The Cotton Club. To make it, he associated with a shady financial backer called Roy Radin, whose drug connections and contract-killing murder resulted in a trial in which Evans scandalised the business by refusing to testify. He was himself convicted of cocaine trafficking in 1980, but always claimed he was only a user.For many, this memoir is the primal scene of Hollywood family dysfunction, with a title that has become ironic shorthand for bad parenting. Christina Crawford was the adopted daughter of Joan Crawford. Her book alleged that Joan was a controlling, boozing tyrant who would beat Christina and who was more interested in her (flagging) career and many affairs with men and women than in being a mother. And then in later life, when Christina had an acting career, she insisted on temporarily taking over Christina’s role in a TV soap called The Secret Storm, as Christina was in hospital for a cyst removal: at the time, Christina was 24 and Joan was 60. Perhaps this extraordinary fact alone would be enough to damn Joan Crawford, but many of her friends and her first husband Douglas Fairbanks Jr denounced the stories as untrue.This is the unchallenged champ of the Hollywood memoirs: glamorous, louche, exciting, amusing, name-dropping, ridiculous, outrageously sexual but seasoned with real tenderness and piquancy as Niven describes his unhappy childhood, the heartbreaking loss of his first wife, and also his military service in the second world war, which involved an encounter with Winston Churchill, who congratulated him on quitting the movies to volunteer, but added: “Young man, you did a fine thing to give up your film career to fight for your country. Mark you, had you not done so it would have been despicable.” Unlike most movie memoirs, there is no tough upbringing in the slums: Niven’s childhood was comfortable (though unhappy) he was the public schoolboy who went from Stowe to Sandhurst and, unlike so many Brit actors who had learned to fabricate a posh voice in rep, Niven’s was the real thing, and his authentic light charm entranced Samuel Goldwyn at the high point of Hollywood’s golden age. His book is packed with anecdotes about Hollywood pals, including the notorious Errol Flynn, but the most extraordinary anecdote is about losing his virginity at 14 to a Piccadilly sex worker. Before they went to bed, she told him to “wash” in a kidney-shaped metal bowl by the bed. “Not yer hands!” she then rasped. Since the book’s publication, its mythology has been debunked, Niven was subsequently found to have concealed the extent of his compulsive infidelities and created the fiction of a happy second marriage, and even exaggerated a little his commitment to serving in the British Army during the war. But this book is addictive and unmissable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d61d897222acbcfefc17cc2d9f468a48bf987002/0_231_3467_2080/master/3467..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abf194857c2b01dfa157659353bbbfb6","title":"wrong to play liverpool v atletico says citys public health director matthew ashton","story":"Liverpool’s Champions League tie at Anfield with Atlético Madrid should not have been played, the city council’s director of public health has said, amid concern at the rising number of confirmed coronavirus cases there.Matthew Ashton, who began in the role on Wednesday, is responsible for coordinating the response to the unprecedented challenges of the pandemic while having to work from home, as confirmed cases in Liverpool rose to 262.“It was not the right decision to stage the match,” Ashton told the , although he said he was not critical of the scientists or medical officers whose advice informed the government’s approach of allowing sporting events to continue. “People don’t make bad decisions on purpose – perhaps the seriousness of the situation wasn’t being understood across government at that time.“Although we will never know, the Atlético Madrid game could have been one of the cultural events and gatherings that influenced the rise in Liverpool. It is definitely one to be included on the list for learning and for a future inquiry, so that organisations can learn and not make similar mistakes.”On 11 March, the day of the last-16 second-leg match, which was won 3-2 by Atlético and attended by 54,000 people, including 3,000 away supporters, Liverpool had just six confirmed cases of coronavirus. Madrid had by then become a centre for the spread of the virus. La Liga decided that day that all matches must be played behind closed doors and Spain’s government had ordered schools closed the day before. In Britain the government was still pursuing its policy of allowing life to continue with no restrictions other than advising people who believed they had Covid-19 symptoms to self-isolate.Dr David Halpern, chief executive of the governmental behavioural insights team, first publicly mentioned the term “herd immunity” that day, suggesting that the majority of the population could be allowed to contract Covid‑19 while people most vulnerable to the virus might be isolated. All major events such as football matches, described as “mass gatherings”, were still scheduled to go ahead. The government changed the policy and began to announce social distancing restrictions the following Monday, 16 March.Joel Rookwood, a senior lecturer in sport business management at the University of Central Lancashire, and a Liverpool supporter, has been suffering severely from the symptoms of Covid-19 since 14 March, although he has not been in hospital so has not been tested for the virus. He was at the Atlético match, and believes he contracted the virus at the game.Writing about his experience in his local newspaper, the Lancashire Evening Post, Rookwood, 39, said he had feared he would be vulnerable if he contracted the virus because he has twice been hospitalised with pneumonia. For days since the match he has suffered from “acute shortness of breath and violent episodes of rigor (shaking). I haven’t eaten solid food or been fully horizontal for 10 days. Precious periods of sleep are counted in minutes, not hours.” He did call 111 last weekend when his condition deteriorated, but was told he was 280th in the queue for an ambulance, and he was not considered critical enough for that to be accelerated.Scientific advice to the government at the time of the match, and the way it was communicated by ministers, made a distinction between “mass gatherings” outdoors, which are said to involve a lower risk of infection, and people meeting inside, in pubs and bars, where the risk of transmission is greater. That appeared to overlook the glaring reality that a mega-event such as Liverpool’s Champions League game involves multiple intense indoor gatherings as well the old Victorian pubs around Anfield were packed for hours that night, as were the club’s bars, shop, concourses, toilets, entertainment and working areas. Even out on the Kop, Rookwood points out that on such a tumultuous football night there was a great deal of close contact.Yet despite the pandemic beginning to take hold in Britain then, he recalls no allowances being made for it: “There were queues and groups everywhere. Pubs were packed, friends greeted each other with the customary contact, fans gathered in condensed queues and stood or sat together in close proximity … The celebrations that night were very physical, shared experiences.”Prof Neil Ferguson, leader of the Imperial College team of scientists advising the government, said that their advice on mass outdoor gatherings did acknowledge that people would also gather indoors at pubs and bars.The issue of allowing Madrid supporters to travel was a separate government decision about restrictions from any particular country – which did not apply from Spain at the time, Ferguson said. “Some people will have got infected,” he said of the transmission potential of mass gatherings, “and if it hadn’t happened they wouldn’t have been.” However he maintains that stopping sporting events, rather than closing schools and maintaining the very restrictive measures now in place, would not have had “a major impact on the spread of the epidemic”.Prof John Ashton, the former regional director of public health for north-west England – who is Matthew Ashton’s father – sounded the alarm about the government’s approach and staging the Liverpool match at the time and he maintains it was wrong to host it.Accepting that without widespread testing the real number of Covid-19 cases is unknown, and it is impossible to be sure where people were infected, he says, nevertheless: “Bringing 3,000 supporters from a very high-incidence area was basically just wrong, and the view that open-air events don’t pose a threat is really simplistic. I hope I am wrong, but I believe that people were put in harm’s way that night.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef673d8dd86a6c566e3ea835b12d8a3f98c12b63/0_242_5159_3097/master/5159..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce61eff4cd57689bfb1676fd4a3431dd","title":"philippe auclair on fifa cantona and board games football weekly extra","story":"Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning and Philippe Auclair discuss Fifa and football governance, Philippe’s favourite sport, mushroom-collecting, juggling careers in music and football, furloughing and George BestJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

This includes nearly £1.3bn of orders that were already in production or had been completed, according to BGMEA.Other brands included in the data, including Next, Marks \u0026amp Spencer and Tesco have since said they will honour existing orders that have been placed with Bangladeshi suppliers.The BGMEA said the impact of the cancellations has already been “catastrophic” for Bangladesh. More than one-quarter of the country’s 4 million garment workers have already lost their jobs or have been furloughed without pay because of order cancellations or the refusal of brands to pay for cancelled shipments.A survey of nearly 300 Bangladeshi garment suppliers by the Workers Rights Consortium (WRC) and Penn State University, found that western retailers have been using force majeure clauses in their contracts to cancel or suspend orders in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.Factory owners in Bangladesh told the  that brands and retailers are postponing the delivery of orders that have already been produced by garment factories so invoices can’t be raised. They are also cancelling all upcoming orders and refusing to pay the cost of raw materials already purchased by suppliers.“We have had to temporarily close our factory for the health and safety of our workers but we are facing ruin because brands and retailers are cancelling orders that we have already produced and if they don’t pay, I can’t pay the workers,”said Mostafiz Uddin, the chief executive of the Bangladesh Apparel Exchange and managing director of Denim Expert, a clothing company that supplies international brands including Peacocks in the UK.“We have to pay upfront for all of our materials and banks are blocking my accounts. I can’t even pay the utility bills. We can’t do anything because after this is over we will need to work with these brands again so we are powerless to fight them,” he said.“I can’t sleep at night. I have 2,000 workers but they are all supporting another 10,000 family members. What will I tell them about their jobs and their pay?”“What we’re seeing is a wholesale abandoning of workers and suppliers,” said Scott Nova, executive director of the WRC.“The way that the garment supply chain is set up, the suppliers take all the risk. They buy the cloth, hire the workers and make the clothes but can’t raise an invoice until the order is shipped. If brands cancel existing orders and refuse shipment then invoices can’t be sent and nobody in Bangladesh gets paid.”In a statement, Primark said that, while it recognised and was “deeply saddened” by the effect this would have further down its supply chain, it had had “no option” but to cancel orders that had been placed with their Bangladeshi suppliers.“If we had not taken this action, we would be taking delivery of stock that we simply could not sell,” Primark said in a statement. “This has been unprecedented action for unprecedented and frankly unimaginable times”Edinburgh Woollen Mill also confirmed it has cancelled all existing orders saying, “Our relationships with suppliers are absolutely fundamental to our business, and this is not what we would ever normally wish to do but the current circumstances are such that this is a necessity.”After the BGMEA data was published, Tesco and Marks \u0026amp Spencer said they were now working with Bangladeshi suppliers to honour existing orders. Tesco is also refuting the figure published in the BGMEA data that it cancelled £50m of orders.In a statement, Next said that as all its shops are currently closed it is cancelling some orders, but will honour existing agreements that are in place up to 10 April.Other brands including H\u0026ampM, Next and Zara said they would also honour existing financial arrangements with their Bangladeshi suppliers and pay invoices in full for orders already placed.Aruna Kashyap, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch said that the situation in Bangladesh exposed the lack of any sort of protection for workers who make huge profits for international fashion brands.Workers who have been furloughed or lost their jobs would struggle to find any way to support their families throughout a Covid-19 lockdown and it could take years for the garment industry to recover, Kashyap said.“The brands are trying to minimise their losses but the impact on the ground in Bangladesh has already been catastrophic and will spell disaster for millions of families,” she said.“Retailers are calling on the governments of garment-producing countries to provide support for workers, but if you’re going to base your hugely profitable supply chain in countries where you know no such social safety net is available, you have to take responsibility when things go wrong.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c63544bced3730a392aad0bb0c5cf39e877f3825/0_325_5262_3157/master/5262.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f07c9d07973fd1716bf0e57c2ef513bd","title":"the new rules of lockdown how to stay clean safe and two metres away from everyone","story":"Is it OK to say hello to your neighbour should you disinfect your bank card regularly and do woolly gloves offer any protection?We face, among other more existential challenges, a whole new set of rules. Coronavirus has turned etiquette on its head and what once were gestures of friendship are now acts of daring. Fundamentally, society used to run on the idea that we were all welcome in one another’s space suddenly, civility amounts to how much distance we keep between ourselves, and how much we shield others from our presence. It is one hell of a gear shift. And it is also important not to overcorrect, not to judge one another from a thousand yards, not to needlessly insult one another in situations that are not, actually, that endangering. Courtesy has never been more serious: it is the way we signal that we still care about each other, when we’re not allowed to hug. So here are some answers to the questions that we are increasingly asking.This social distancing thing: how should I walk down the pavement? In the middle? On the left? On the right? Or next to the street so I can get right out of people’s way?If you are on your own, you can walk down the street however you damn please just keep an eye out for people coming towards you and maintain your distance. Try not to dawdle where the pavement narrows, especially if people might be coming up behind you. If you are walking as a couple, inconvenience yourselves – walk into the gutter, separate, go round the parked car – on behalf of anyone else. If you are walking as a family, go in the bubble formation, all members round some central member. You are not going to scatter in a uniform way as someone comes towards you, but they can see you, and if you all stick together, they can react accordingly.“The protocol,” explains Dr Jane Greatorex, a virologist, microbiologist and senior tutor at Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge, “is that nobody can breathe the virus on you. Experiments have been done looking at that. But if you are passing too close and an inidual coughs on you, then you do stand a chance of being infected.” This is the logic behind the two-metre distance: that someone outside that distance could indeed cough, and that would be OK. “This is going to sound really stupid,” Greatorex continues, “but people have to understand how big two metres is. Getting it across to kids in particular: my local Waitrose has a cardboard cutout of Jürgen Klopp.” (For non-football fans, Klopp is 1.93m tall, or 6ft 4in.) On the other hand, if someone walks past you without observing that two-metre distance, but hasn’t coughed or sneezed, there is no need to scream abuse at them.What should I do if someone gets too close, or looks as if they are about to?Sonia Adesara is a doctor, coming out of self-isolation to join the frontline against Covid-19 this week (I put it so dramatically to indicate that it is our duty to listen to her). “I think the general etiquette if there’s someone working at the till who every two minutes has a person coming close towards their face, try to give them a bit of space, because they’re being put in that situation by their work. But if someone’s jogging past and they’re suddenly within two metres, you need to understand that it’s not life or death. Someone running past you is not going to pass on the virus. It’s more sustained contact than that.” The reason we try to keep distance on public transport is in case of droplets.Is there any point in wearing a face mask? What about a scarf over your mouth and nose?Adesara says that if you are coughing and spluttering, anything that protects other people from droplets will help, although better etiquette is to cough or sneeze into a tissue and throw it away. Greatorex underlines the distinction between a paper face mask and full PPE equipment: “The sort of face mask that they’ll be wearing on intensive care wards has to be specially fitted, in order to prevent any virus particle getting on to your face.” It is rarely necessary for people to try to find that protection outside a clinical setting, although a care worker, going house to house, might want to wear a paper mask, because they will “stop a cough going ‘whoomph’ out of your mouth” (Greatorex). Of course, if you are actively coughing, you shouldn’t be outside at all, or working. So this is really advice for a surprise first cough.Is it safe to touch shop doors? Touchscreens? Your shopping? How can I make it safer?Greatorex explains: “Virus particles have an envelope, the lipid molecule. It will bind to some things really well – soft fabrics and paper – and it will die relatively quickly on those. But on hard surfaces – glass, plastic – that it won’t bind to, it can stay alive much longer. Stainless steel is a disaster.” Try to avoid touching hard surfaces with your hands altogether, and use an elbow or a shoulder if you can. Where you cannot avoid using your hands – escalator handrails, shopping trolleys, car doors – you should first and foremost avoid touching your face, come in the house, wash your hands, then put on plastic gloves and go out and clean the hard surfaces that you will regularly touch, such as your front door.As for food packaging, you are bound to pick it up, so just wipe it when you get home, washing your hands before and after.What about deliveries? Are they safe to take into the house at once?“The outside packaging is the only thing that’s really going to be a danger to you,” Greatorex says. “Treat everything from outside with a degree of caution, because someone’s packaged it.”What is the best way to wash any food I get to make sure it’s germ-free?Greatorex says: “Factory production lines, your Tesco ready meal, that’ll be as clean as a whistle. It will all have been done in a sterile environment. Fruit and vegetables, likewise, will mostly have been sorted by machines. I’d still wash an apple in soap and water, especially if it was from a farm shop.” Wait: she would wash an apple with soap? “Well, I am a microbiologist.”You should treat all food with a degree of caution unless you have grown it yourself. If you think that is ridiculous, remember the salmonella outbreak that came from strawberries, or the infections you can get from bagged salad.Should I be regularly disinfecting my bank card, my phone etc?You should wipe your phone down with a cloth and disinfectant twice a day. If you have mostly used contactless payment, your bank cards should be OK. Most people seem to have given up using cash, not so much for the potential for infection from the cash itself – although the virus can survive better on polymer notes than on paper – but because you don’t really want to be handing things to anyone.Should I wear gloves in the supermarket – and are woolly ones at all effective if I don’t have latex gloves?Woolly gloves are worse than pointless. They trap the virus, so you still have to wash them regularly – and hands are easier to wash.I have been out to exercise once and didn’t see a single person. Does this really have to count as my one piece of exercise? Is it OK to go out again?This is all about messaging: if you went out once and saw nobody, of course you haven’t infected anyone. But people who live in built-up areas are going to find it impossible to get that level of isolation, and it will be corrosive to harmony if we say the strictest rules are only for people who live in tower blocks. What we are trying to avoid is the measures becoming any more stringent: in France and Germany, you are not allowed more than a fixed number of metres from your front door. And that will involve abiding by rules for which there seem to be scant microbiological foundation.Shopping for food or medicine, exercise, feeding animals and looking after other people who are self-isolating. Especially if they are cocooning for 12 weeks, waving at them through a window counts as essential, so long as you combine it with something else they actually need. If you are going stir-crazy, the best thing you can do is join your local volunteer group, which always has essential errands.How long should I carry on paying my childminder, cleaner etc if I cannot use them?This is not a medical question as such, but over to Adesara: “You should pay everyone you normally employ for as long as you can afford to. You have to think about what other people’s situations are: you may not be using their services, but that person also needs to feed themselves and their families.”It it OK to meet up with people who live close by if I keep two metres away?As long as you maintain your distance – Greatorex still talks to her neighbours over the fence. If you see someone you know when you’re taking your essential exercise, of course you can say hello.Can I let my dogs and cats socialise with others? Can they pass on coronavirus?There have been reports of two dogs having caught the virus from their owners, but there is no evidence of animals being able to pass it on, so it is still OK, in a park, to let your dogs frolic so long as you do not get too close to the owners. Good luck stopping your cat from socialising.How do I tell someone they are not behaving safely?Ask yourself first whether or not you are enjoying playing the world’s police officer a little bit too much. Delivery drivers and other essential workers report having been harassed in the street for being out, when they are on their way to work. It is much easier for some people to self-isolate than it is for others, and consider before you judge someone else’s behaviour the possibility that their situation is more complicated than you appreciate. There are very few circumstances in which upbraiding someone will be more effective for your safety than simply moving a bit further away from them. Adesara is unnerved by how much the police are relishing their new powers: “One force’s social media feed was shaming someone the other day for walking her dog in high heels. But there is really nothing dangerous about walking your dog in heels.”Do I need to wash my clothes and have a shower as soon as I get in after I have been outside even if I have not touched anything?This somewhat depends what being outside entailed. Greatorex’s sister works in a supermarket, where she interacts with a large number of people, and changes into fresh clothes at the end of work, brings her uniform home in a bag and puts it straight in the washing machine (having first washed her hands). Other people in similar high-contact jobs – teachers who are still working, for instance – have been advised to keep a bin bag at their front door and their washing machine open, then strip as soon as they walk in, put all their clothes in the bag, have a shower, then wash the clothes.If you are just going out to make an essential journey, make sure you have a jumper or coat that you wear only outdoors.Do I need to wash my hands all the time and not touch my face even if I haven’t been out of the house for a week?“If you never see anybody, no. Even if there was once virus on any of your surfaces, it will die off and you’ll be surrounded by dead virus,” Greatorex reassures us.How do I stop myself eating all the lockdown snacks?People seem to go one of two ways, either eating everything they can see, or losing their appetites with anxiety. It is actually better to be eating all the snacks, because at least it will cheer you up.You could do elaborate menu plans and try to stick to three meals a day. Or you could just give yourself a break. I got so bored the other day, I taught my dog to back away from cheese. I put it on Twitter, and someone said: “That’s great – can you teach me?”• This article was amended on 2 April 2020.

I’m off to find a lipstick to match my slippers ... Rihanna, the reigning queen of stay-at-home couture, made history yesterday, appearing on the cover of British Vogue in a durag, the choice of bedtime headwear for many black people. Way ahead of last year’s nightwear as a daywear trend, she previously donned one covered in Swarovski crystals at the CFDA awards in 2014. In 2013, she wore a doobie wrap – a common interim style black women use to keep freshly treated hair intact during the night – at the American Music awards. Her taste in headgear makes me feel much more chic as I work from home in a polyester durag and oversized shirt.I miss going out, but I miss getting ready to go out probably just as much, if not more. And it’s not just me – as the #OOTD hashtag declines during lockdown, the @wfhfits Instagram account, which documents the showstopping outfits contributors are wearing to work from home, is now 18.4k strong. The #DontRushChallenge takes this to the next level. Started by Twitter user @lase_asoloo, participants go from drab to fab in the (slickly edited) tap of a makeup brush. Much like the DMX Challenge – which last year saw women showcasing various hairstyles synced to the 46 names the rapper lists on his song What They Really Want – the #DontRushChallenge is dominated by #blackgirlmagic and has been an utter joy to watch.The first and foremost reason is that the challenge is an antidote to the still-monolithic representations of black women in the media. Even with that industry’s newfound commitment to ersity, ersity within that ersity is often an afterthought. And yet the #DontRushChallenge could not be more multifaceted: we have seen plus-size black women along with black girls with piercings and some in fetish gear. There’s one for naturalistas (black women who have made the decision to forgo chemical hair treatments) and another for bald black women. Black women across the globe have joined in from Britain, the US, Belgium, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Kenya. On the continent, participants represent the specificities of their culture from different ethnic groups and tribes (such as Yoruba women from Ibadan in Nigeria and Habesha women from Ethiopia and Eritrea), who are usually lumped together as homogenous citizens of the mythical country called “Africa”.Scrolling the hashtag reminded me just how fun it is to dress up for the sake of it. The idea that the only reason women bother is for male attention or validation (an assumption that is as misogynistic as it is heteronormative) is pervasive. The view of makeup as a form of trickery is also prevalent the “take her swimming before the first date” and “makeup sorcery” memes have routinely been used to shame women, especially black women. But here, the bare faces and hair bonnets in the “befores” are as integral to challenge as the high-glam, at times unrecognisable “afters” there is nothing to hide, but plenty of craftwomanship to show off. Bravo, ladies I’m off to find a shade of lipstick that complements my slippers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99f1bcbe6144b2be0639ca596e9af537150e5fa2/0_0_2284_1370/master/2284..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d70407738f5463c25f32de43e3a023a8","title":"lee ryan takes over the world is this the future of post pandemic celebrity","story":"Stars and entrepreneurs will find bizarre opportunities in the conspiracy-theory laced hell for ordinary folk that is the coronavirus pandemicSpare a thought for those tasked with covering the world of showbiz in this unprecedented time of crisis (me). Celebrities have hissed backwards into their bunkers. The nightclubs they used to fall out of have shut. Every possible configuration of social media beef has been replaced with platitudes about staying indoors. They are singing. There is no meat on the bones to make soup from. There is nothing out here on the wastelands to write about. Do you want 1,200 words about Drake’s pictures of his kid? Do you want me to break apart Alex James’s scrumpy recipe (“Orchards are enchanting places”)? Do you want that? Look in the mirror and gaze sternly into your own eyes. Think about this. Do you want that? You don’t want that.The world of celebrity is changing under the dark shadow of ’rona 2020, and it’s important to recognise the hair-sprouting and the clenching bones of this sort of social puberty. What emerges from the burrows once all this has blown over will be very different from what went in. Some will not have enough celebrity credit in the bank to weather this storm (do you think the phrase “Wallace from Love Island” will mean anything by the time September rolls around? It will sound like an alien screaming a dull language into your bones. It will sound like a dog throwing up). Some, without the anchor of a furloughed PR team telling them what to do, will go rogue in lockdown, emerge having done something weird on Instagram Live from their own mansion, like shaving their own head and making soup from their hair (I just keep getting the words “Miley Cyrus”, like an intrusive thought, over and over, about this), their pre-pandemic fame diminished by the actions of their pandemic lifestyle. Some will somehow emerge more famous than ever (Kylie Jenner, after wrangling her cosmetics factories into producing hand sanitiser, will somehow leave this process richer and more beloved. Chrissy Teigen’s bread recipes will sweep her ever closer to an inevitable presidential run). It will be different. We don’t know how, but it will be.So it’s tough to say how the next few months will shake out, basically. But here’s a rough prediction:Elon Musk could somehow leave this whole thing richerI still think of the time 12 children got caught in a flooded Thai cave for most of a month and, as the world reacted with anxiety and horror, Elon Musk flew out, took a useless mini-submarine made from repurposed rocket parts, and then bafflingly called one of the cave rescuers “pedo guy” on Twitter. Many people see Musk as an aspirational figure because he specialises in the sort of cutting-edge nerd-tech that gets Reddit moderators frothing at the upvote button and he knows what Rick and Morty is, but for me he is inspiring because he’s exactly who I would be if I had somehow muscled my way up to billionaire status: great flashes of genius undermined by getting Too Online and sinking your own stocks. I don’t like him, but I admire him. He’s a messy bitch who lives for drama.Fun, then, that there is a new global subject of fascination, and Musk is dipping his red little toe right in there. He’s doing something with Tesla and ventilators that I can’t tell whether is innocently benevolent or the start of a 14-week Musk power-move that somehow ends up with him buying Amazon.Say what you want about Gwyneth Paltrow – I’ll start: she was horrendously miscast in the Iron Man franchise – but with Goop she has created her own entire category of person, which is someone who believes so strongly that a crystal can replace deodorant that their uneradicated stink somehow becomes a lifestyle choice. A pandemic like this one – no cure on the immediate horizon, scientists in masks still figuring out viral loads and invisible panic enveloping us – is ripe for a celebrity to come out with a semi-complicated coconut-water-and-orzo recipe they swear “reversed their symptoms in two days!” before embarrassing themselves by directly @-ing the WHO to try to tell them about it. Possible contenders for this one: Jessica Alba, Kate Hudson, Cher.If you have been paying attention at all to WhatsApp forwards (or, my personal favourite, “local town Facebook groups”) you will see a pattern of conspiracy minded garbagethink going around completely unchallenged. One of the dominant theories is that coronavirus is somehow being broadcast to us by the Chinese government via 5G towers. I’m still waiting on the peer-review for this. Another I’ve enjoyed is: “inhaling boiling water with an orange in it kills Covid-19, for ever”, with the appropriate video tutorials. Honestly, who needs vaccines when you have someone who still types “Facebook” into Google to get to Facebook giving you scientific advice they made up in a dream.From all this, a celebrity endorser will emerge, and it’s not too much of a stretch to say it’s going to be Lee Ryan from Blue. He has already had to apologise this week for going on Facebook and saying the devil runs the government (Lee Ryan from Blue on a normal one is terrifyingly similar to “me after exactly five pints”, and that’s something I have to make peace with). He has already made sinister allusions to the role 5G is playing in society, and has enough of a platform to whip a full movement together. It’s not hard to picture Ryan pivoting from “fallen singer with an interesting browser history” to “full, Alex Jones-level conspiracy theorist” by the time all this is over. By Christmas, Lee Ryan broadcasting live for three hours in a beret and aviators – undisclosed location, yelling about vaccines, the whole shebang – will be the most-watched thing on TV.“Cancel culture” – the one-strike-and-you’re-out boycotting that has emerged in recent years – has gone a little quiet in the wake of corona, because, truly, there are better things to worry about right now. But it’s hibernating, not dead: J-Lo managed to ripple the waters this week after being pictured going to a closed-to-the-public gym, quiet shouts of “was that really necessary, Jennifer Lopez?” ringing out in the distance. Once we’re all six more weeks into this, society will become a tinderbox, and it only takes one mistimed celebrity post to set the whole thing on fire. Possible contenders: Post Malone is pictured hammering on the shutters of a Foot Locker Ariana Grande gets cancelled for getting a box of Soleros in her otherwise essentials-only food shop DJ Khaled forces an emergency services rescue after getting stranded on his jet-ski, public forced to cover the million-dollar bill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/001830d20a63022669482a71a43f97d0e40aa964/0_539_1831_1098/master/1831.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c63aa669bc57518625bc8b9ff2b0edf8","title":"tiger king joe exotic netflix southern queerness","story":"Who could have guessed that a mullet-wearing, polyamorous exotic animal owner would become TV’s most talked-about gay star?In the early 2000s, the most popular queer characters on TV were Jack McFarland and Will Truman of the sitcom Will \u0026amp Grace. Will and Jack were so beloved, Vice-President Joe Biden once theorized the show had played a major role in shifting views on marriage equality. The characters were also the start of a trope that would prevail on TV for years: the cosmopolitan gay male. The image would live on in shows such as Queer as Folk, Looking, and the reality competitions Project Runway and America’s Next Top Model. Who could imagine that 20 years on, a mullet-wearing, gay, polyamorous exotic animal owner from rural Oklahoma would become TV’s biggest talked about gay star?Joe Exotic, the eccentric subject of the Netflix docu-series Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness, has amassed a fervent following in the short time since the show’s premiere on Friday. The rapper Cardi B live-tweeted her reactions and expressed a desire to start a GoFundMe campaign for Mr Exotic, whose full name Wikipedia gives as Joseph Allen Maldonado-Passage (né Schreibvogel). Fans have taken to dressing up as Joe, slapping on fake handlebar mustaches and blond mullet wigs. And actors such as Dax Shepard and Jared Leto are pitching themselves to play the gun-loving zookeeper in a forthcoming scripted miniseries. Amid the anxiety of the coronavirus pandemic, we are finding humor and relief in an imperfect, self-described “redneck” queer who owns more than 200 tigers. He’s the furthest cry from the affable, anodyne queer men who typically win America over, such as Cam and Mitchell of Modern Family and the “gay best friend” cast of Queer Eye. But unlikely times call for an unlikely hero.“It’s possible people need a really flawed person to humanize right now,” says Matt Brim, professor and author of Poor Queer Studies. Brim says the love for Joe might be more complicated than it immediately appears to be. “What is the calculus here? For some viewers, Joe Exotic’s rural white queer class identity may be his flaw, so that looking past or accepting it signals tolerance, that most passive-aggressive of power plays. For other viewers, those same qualities – in their specific and unwieldy combination – may represent the very soup of our common dilemma. One thing’s for sure: we’re not in South Bend any more,” he said, referring to the city where the former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg was mayor.Joe belongs to a rural, Republican-voting, working-class background, which makes for great TV for those who have a superficial understanding of the south. Joe appears to be keenly aware of this fact, playing into the shock value of his queer, southern life. Before Tiger King, he pitched multiple reality shows about his life to networks and starred in country music videos with his husbands. He is the perfect kind of reality star – straddling the line between an unrestrained “big” personality and a caricature.Joe’s queerness and southern-ness intersect in distinct, complex ways. This includes his use of meth, a popular gay recreational drug. (In 2018, Oklahoma, site of Joe’s zoo, was listed as having one of the highest rates of meth use in the US.) He goes out of his way to associate with traditional ideas of masculinity through his love for guns, collection of large, aggressive animals, and pursuit of young, butch men who have previous histories of only dating women.In the show, Joe says he fell in love with tigers while recovering from a suicide attempt he linked to his parents’ homophobia. Did Joe decide the best way to reconcile his queerness with his surroundings was to assimilate in the most extreme ways – leaning into the love for hunting and control over wildlife that dominates southern culture? Then he cultivated this assimilation and it grew into a profitable persona. Joe made it so that the most outrageous thing about him in Oklahoma was neither his queerness or poly relationships. It was his tigers.Despite his progressive lifestyle, Joe himself is not a progressive. He believes in unregulated gun rights and, during his bizarre, far-fetched run for governor of Oklahoma, positioned himself as a libertarian. A viral video shows him pondering why black people can say the N-word but white people can’t. However, his queerness complicates this otherwise predictable ideology. At his wedding, we see Joe and his two husbands dressed in fuschia western shirts – none of the elements feel coherent or like they belong together. Since its legalization in 2015, same-sex marriage no longer possesses the same air of radicalism and defiance. But a polyamorous one? Even the progressives in Brooklyn might bat a lash at that.In Tiger King, Joe presents a less than perfect view of himself – from his meth use to nasty spats with co-workers to his tragic, failed marriages to allegedly straight men. But, in many ways, Joe’s imperfections (and criminal convictions) are what make him feel like a breakthrough for queer representation. Because “perfect” is so 1998.However, there is the danger we are collectively laughing at Joe and his rural background, instead of laughing with him.Representation of queerness in red states has always been sparse and complicated. The portrayals often face accusations of being exploitative or overly simplistic. A recent one was John B McLemore of the hit podcast series S-Town. McLemore was a queer horologist living in Woodstock, Alabama, a small, conservative place he hated. Critics called the podcast “voyeuristic” and irresponsible for outing McLemore after his death. Netflix’s Queer Eye occasionally chooses LGBTQ+ subjects living in conservative locales for its transformations, and the show’s format – “fix all your problems in an hour” with a group of affluent, pro-consumption coastal gay men – has drawn scrutiny.Does the novelty of a complicated figure such as Joe Exotic expose our preferences for coastal queer narratives? “Yes,” says John Howard, professor and author of Men Like That: A Southern Queer History. “For 25 years, scholars have criticized a bicoastal bias in US queer history that has focused attention on east and west coast metropolitan areas. But this is changing.” Howard points to the conversations Tiger King is producing. “Let’s hope the public debate expands. Perhaps we’ll learn more about working-class queers and trans people of color who, as yet, remain at the margins of Joe’s narrative.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b3c7f59522e2a6f894c0f441bcebd07d850f47d/13_230_3534_2122/master/3534..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c9078f254d43c6416f4151a93d7fed3","title":"uk media outlets told not to promote baseless 5g coronavirus theories","story":"Broadcasters warned they face sanctions if they give airtime to false Covid-19 health advice British broadcasters are being warned that they face sanctions from the media regulator if they give airtime to false health advice about coronavirus, after a Sussex radio station was given a severe warning for broadcasting baseless conspiracy theories that the pandemic is linked to the rollout of 5G phone networks.Members of the public complained after hearing a broadcast on the community radio station Uckfield FM, in which a woman introduced as a “registered nurse” claimed, without any evidence, that the rollout of 5G phone technology in Wuhan was connected to the outbreak and that the virus had been created in a lab.It later emerged that she was a practitioner of alternative medicines, while the media regulator said it was “not aware of any reputable scientific evidence to corroborate such a contentious claim which runs contrary to all official advice, both in the UK and internationally, about coronavirus.”Ofcom confirmed it was actively monitoring television and radio stations that might be broadcasting potentially harmful views about the causes and origins of Covid-19 that have “the potential to undermine people’s trust in the advice of mainstream sources of information” during the crisis.Baseless suggestions that coronavirus is linked to 5G have spread widely in recent weeks on WhatsApp, Facebook groups, and on the fast-growing community website NextDoor – all of which have the ability to reach vastly more people than a small community radio station in Sussex but are much less regulated.The spread of baseless material on WhatsApp connecting 5G to coronavirus has now been covered in many mainstream news outlets, boosted by social media posts by celebrities such as the actor Woody Harrelson.This poses a conundrum for those seeking to convince the public that the fears are unfounded. Fact-checking organisations often find that people are reluctant to change their mind once convinced of an issue if they are simply told they are wrong, despite international agencies finding there are no health risks associated with 5G and no link to coronavirus. There is also the risk that declining trust in mainstream media means that attempts to stop the claims spreading are seen as a cover-up.In the case of Uckfield FM, Ofcom reported that the guest also used her appearance to launch a lengthy attack on health professionals in the NHS dealing with the pandemic.She said: “Just because you have this qualification, do not wear that like a crown of glory … The days are gone when you were a doctor and a nurse and everybody trusted you. Those days are well gone. Do your own research. Do not trust a qualification. I know many people who are very qualified who know very little. Because remember the people that own the establishments that teach us, it all travels back to the same thing. It’s all owned by big pharma. They own the medical elite and they determine what gets published.”Ofcom decided that the 20-minute interview with a person purporting to be an authoritative health figure who was not sufficiently challenged posed a significant risk to public health at a time of national crisis. It ordered the station to broadcast an apology in a manner of regulator’s choosing and warned other outlets that it would be stepping up monitoring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00be7cea913a27c3a9a2c55567cad4abbc998125/0_0_2048_1230/master/2048..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=300d30be860b9232b4356c2336df5606","title":"loan credit card payments frozen uk financial regulator coronavirus","story":"Financial regulator fast-tracks measures to help consumers during coronavirus crisisThe financial regulator has announced plans to freeze loan and credit card payments for up to three months as part of emergency measures for consumers impacted by the coronavirus outbreak.The measures, which would usually require a lengthy consultation, could come into force as soon as 9 April. The Financial Conduct Authority said the process was being fast-tracked “given the national emergency and the significant impact on consumers’ finances right now”.It is aimed at consumers and renters who are not benefiting from existing relief measures that have targeted homeowners – with mortgage payment holidays – or business owners.Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to £5m with no interest for six months for smaller companies.Taxes levied on commercial premises will be abolished this year for all retailers, leisure outlets and hospitality sector firms.Britain’s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of £10,000. Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of £25,000.Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by £1,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits.Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above £94.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.The proposals include a temporary freeze on loan and credit card payments for consumers who are facing financial difficulties as a result of the outbreak.The FCA said consumers who were at risk of having their credit cards suspended because of the regulator’s new affordability rules would not lose access to their accounts.Lenders would also have to waive interest charges on arranged overdrafts up to £500 over the same period, which would extend relief already announced by some banks including Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds.But the FCA’s emergency measures force firms to make sure all customers are “no worse off” due to the changes, meaning some customers may revert to lower interest rates.Banks and credit card providers will have to ensure that consumer credit ratings are unaffected by any of the measures, the FCA said.The FCA’s interim chief executive, Christopher Woolard, said: “Coronavirus has caused an unprecedented financial shock with far-reaching consequences for consumers in every corner of the UK.“If confirmed, this package of measures we are proposing today will help provide affected consumers with the temporary financial support they need to help them weather the storm during this challenging time.”The news has been welcomed by consumer advocates including Martin Lewis, who said it would help level the playing field for customers who may not have time to shop around for better rates during the crisis.Lewis, the founder of MoneySavingExpert, said: “We have already seen many unsecured lenders put some forbearance criteria in place … However the provision is patchy and has become a banking lottery and that’s unfair – no one could have taken into account when they signed up for products how considerate each lender would be in these extraordinary times.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ee1c2bc0787f87636cf193387dab43124022f02/87_250_5965_3582/master/5965.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=559bb5c656298f728662c42316d4d088","title":"from houseparty to zoom our digital lives in lockdown","story":"The lockdown across the world has led people to desperately seek out new tools for maintaining their work and social lives online.

These will be a combination of tests for live cases of the virus and antibody tests to determine whether someone has previously been infected. Germany is carrying out around 70,000 tests a day, all for live cases of Covid-19.However, the government was also forced to acknowledge it was not likely to have the capacity to embark on a programme of mass testing for live cases in the general public, as advocated by the World Health Organization and public experts.Instead, No 10 and health department sources confirmed the general public would primarily have to rely on the potential for an antibody test – but these are “ideally” done 28 days after an infection, to give the clearest indication of whether someone has already had the virus, according to Prof John Newton, a senior Public Health England official.Newton said the idea of testing all those that have symptoms in the country was “unrealistic” and the as yet unproven antibody test was more likely to be used by people at home.Hancock said work was progressing with the antibody tests but results for many of the early tests had been “poor” and he was more hopeful about later ones that have been acquired. The government has bought options on up to 17.5m antibody tests of different types that are currently being tested, but cannot say definitively when they will be safe to use.When the antibody tests are available, Hancock said the government was looking at the possibility of immunity certificates, so some of the population “can therefore get back to work as much as possible”.However, some critics fear that this could lead to resentment in the population who have not had the virus, and even that people could deliberately try to get infected in order to get an immunity certificate.Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, told the  that immunity certificates for frontline medical workers would be crucial for allowing staff to return to work and allowing personal protective equipment to be rationed in the safest way.However, in the wider population fraud could be an issue, which could rule out home-based testing, and there were concerns about unintended consequences. “People going out to deliberately get infected so they could get back to work is a concern and I don’t know how you’d avoid that,” he said. “Those are big issues.”After a week spent in isolation with coronavirus himself, Hancock was forced to defend the government on numerous fronts. He told the press briefing:Tensions have bubbled in Whitehall over who is to blame for low testing numbers in the UK, with some political sources blaming Public Health England (PHE) for not placing enough emphasis on the issue in recent weeks.However, PHE rejected criticism that it had been trying to do all the testing itself and was too inflexible in which chemicals were allowed to be used, suggesting it was the responsibility of ministers to find private capacity for more tests.Prof Paul Cosford, the emeritus medical director of the public health body, said that PHE’s role was to “make sure our labs are doing what they need to do” in terms of testing hospital patients with a clinical need, with NHS staff a second priority.Conservative backbenchers voiced concern in private about the government’s failure to ramp up testing, saying there was anxiety that the public mood could turn against the government rapidly if it appeared there was no end to the lockdown as a result.A former minister who supported Johnson in the leadership contest said they were worried public sentiment could turn rapidly: “I think the government could get blown away if people are still inside after Easter and there is no progress on testing.”Concerns were voiced that Johnson and other ministers had appeared to allow PHE to lead on testing, without asking the independent researchers and the private sector to get involved until Hancock’s announcement. “The fact that there’s not mass testing now is inexcusable,” another Conservative MP complained.One senior MP said the party will be watching the polls closely and said he was “frankly amazed” that Johnson’s popularity was holding up at present. A bit like the virus, there might be a two-week lag before the public comes to fully realise that the government is failing to get the testing issue under control, they said.“There are some in my party who are trying to blame PHE, but ultimately, it will be the politicians who get the blame if the economy collapses because we can’t test NHS workers.“The death toll will become totemic. If we get thousands of people dying every day for several days, who knows where this will go. It is frightening, and the prime minister looks like he doesn’t know what to do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa8c094215eae4b21ad24d12efa0e8e8af2736a4/0_92_3500_2100/master/3500..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38268d20bfa6f5bda5f21e46a1df1bea","title":"uk coronavirus live news updates covid 19 testing","story":"Health secretary writes off £13.4bn of historic NHS debt Boris Johnson still symptomatic comedian Eddie Large dies after contracting coronavirus.

Read the full story here.Hancock said more temporary hospitals like the new Nightingale hospital in London and the ones planned for Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow, could be needed in other parts of the country.Hancock said he would “look at all options” to keep women and children in abusive households safe. Hancock confirmed the government is looking at “immunity certificates” for people who have had the disease and developed immunity. However, it is too early in the science to be able to put clarity on that at the moment.Hancock confirmed mass community testing is the ultimate goal, but cannot put a figure on the timing because it depends on how quickly a home antibody test is developed and how quickly swab testing can be ramped up.Hancock said the curve must be flattened (reducing the rate of infection) before the lockdown can be lifted.Hancock said Premier League footballers at clubs were staff had been furloughed can indeed “play their part” by taking a pay cut.Hancock gave “a firm commitment” that all NHS staff who need a test will get one by the end of the month.Newton said testing will be crucial to differentiate between who has immunity and who has not been infected and therefore does not have immunity. That information will inform the models and the strategy regarding the lockdown.Hancock said testing is critical to ending the lockdown – i.e. pillar four in his strategy.Number one at the moment must be that people continue to stay at home to control the spread.Powis said there is still a lot to learn about the virus as it is a new virus that will inform the strategy, including:We do not know how many people are asymptomatic.We do not know how long immunity lasts.We do not yet know what drugs are likely to work and vaccines take time to develop.Hancock said the government is “currently confident” that the UK has the supply of medicines needed. We have a very detailed plan for making sure that we have the full supply of medicines, including the ones that you mention, sedatives and all the medicines needed for those who have Covid-19 and people being ventilated. We probably have one of the strongest understandings of the supply chain of anywhere in the world because of the preparations we did for a no-deal Brexit, and we keep them constantly under review. In fact, I took a meeting on this question today. So whilst we, of course with the lockdowns around the world, we are highly vigilant, we are currently confident that we have the supplies of medicines that are needed.Powis said NHS staff who are self-isolating at home because a member of their family has symptoms are the priority, because they may be able to go back to work.Hancock confirmed the new goal of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month is across all five pillars. No test is better than a bad test.He did not commit to a firm date by which every NHS worker can be tested as he did not want to “over-promise”, but he said “it will absolutely be before the end of the month”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1113e0ad5ae7c5e2da8324f33a7e95f9ebdfd61d/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=235bec96e6be1b8602ffbd2cfa581e41","title":"labour leadership election the latest odds","story":"Keir Starmer continues to be the bookie’s favourite to replace Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the opposition, and enjoyed a bounce after the weekend’s hustings.

From the plethora of TV shows on competing streaming platforms to the seemingly infinite choice offered by online music and gaming services, the wealth of new material being released each month is staggering. Yet when it comes to cultural consumption, audiences are increasingly choosing to seek out classic, safe bets – forgoing the next big thing in favour of the last big thing.According to UK media watchdog Ofcom, the single most-watched programme in the first quarter of 2019 was the 1990s sitcom Friends. In the US, the top Netflix spot has long been held by the US version of the Office, which first aired 15 years ago. Meanwhile at the box office, sequels and reboots abound. Last year’s top five grossing films in the UK included the remake of the Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: Episode IX – the Rise of Skywalker.Even computer gaming is stepping increasingly back into the past. Two of the biggest launches in recent years have actually been mini versions of the comparatively ancient 80s and 90s games consoles, Sega’s Mega Drive and Nintendo’s SNESNES. “Without a doubt, people are going back to the classics,” says Iain Simons, director of the National Videogame Museum in Sheffield. “They pioneered so many of the things we have today.”One obvious reason why audiences are opting for classic, safe bets is the sense of comfort they can provide in a world that feels increasingly precarious. This feeling of comfort isn’t simply a function of nostalgic familiarity, however. Today’s new TV shows often reflect our current dystopian mood and the fashion for grisly narrative plot twists and traumatic backstories. Think Black Mirror compared with Frasier.There are other reasons for playing it safe when it comes to pop culture. Partly, it can be about taking joy in simplicity amid the complexity of the world we live in. Our frantic pace of life makes spare time so rare that people are wary of not enjoying the little they have of it. “I can see the appeal in a safe bet, especially if you are going to spend a lot of money on tickets,” says Anna Smith, film critic, broadcaster and host of the all-female film review podcast Girls on Film.Likewise, Simons notes that there’s a beauty in the relative simplicity of older video games: “There’s something comforting about only having three lives in a game there are only so many hours in the day.”Nostalgic cultural consumption can also remove the all-too common problem of too much choice. “The overabundance of content can make people feel overwhelmed,” says Cristel Russell, a professor of marketing at Graziadio Business School, who has conducted several studies into people’s re-reading of stories and reconsumption of media. “It’s like going to a restaurant and the menu being 20 pages long. You’re probably just going to order something you’ve had before.”One of Russell’s studies found that revisiting cultural favourites is such a deliberate act – as opposed to a habit – that she coined the term “volitional reconsumption” to describe it. She also found that nostalgic culture can offer something that new works can’t: a form of self-discovery. “The thing you’re watching hasn’t changed, but you have,” explains Russell. “You’ve accumulated all this knowledge and experience, so you’re not looking at it through the same eyes. When you revisit it, you get to see how much you have changed as a person.”Revisiting pieces of classic cultural entertainment can also give us bonding social experiences. For instance, events such as Secret Cinema, which screens old favourites in specially-created immersive worlds, thrive on the feeling of community and belonging you get when you bring fans of a movie together to celebrate it. “I think one of the keys here is the community aspect: we love to watch a cherished film with others, and laugh and cry together,” says Smith. “In a society that feels increasingly less community driven, in many ways this is an outlet for a positive shared experience.”There are other possible psychological benefits to reconsuming cultural works. Erica Hepper, a lecturer in personality and social psychology at the University of Surrey, has researched the social emotion of nostalgia, including the reconsumption of works of art. One study involved letting participants choose an old, beloved song to listen to and then comparing their emotions with those of people who hadn’t done so. “Time and again, we found that people who listened to something that was nostalgic experienced all of these psychological boosts – they feel more connected to people, they feel better about themselves, they feel more optimistic,” says Hepper. “They also feel more motivated to achieve their goals. So nostalgia isn’t about being stuck in the past, it actually looks to the future.”Indeed, one of Russell’s studies showed that reconsuming cultural works can even involve more intense cognitive processes than watching something for the first time. To test this, subjects were made to wear eye-tracking equipment while watching a black-and-white Russian film twice. The equipment monitored both the movement of their eyes and pupil dilation, which can indicate the intensity of the cognitive effort they were undergoing. “Sure enough, on the second viewing, your eye gaze goes to different parts of the screen – you are taking it in in a different way,” says Russell.She found that people were watching in a way that suggested they appreciated the film much more as a work of art on the second viewing. For instance, they were looking at all the creative details rather than just following the plot. Moreover, she found that people’s pupils were more dilated while doing so. “When you rewatch something, the cognitive effort involved changes. You are hyper-responsive – all of your senses are on. It is a much more intense process than watching something for the first time.”That intensity might seem counterintuitive, given how comforting nostalgic pop culture can feel. But as the trend itself illustrates, opting for comforting pop culture isn’t a passive act. Given the emotional and psychological upsides of the tried and tested, it’s no wonder we enjoy watching things again. And again. And again.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

Alexi Duggins explains why playing it safe is a smarter step Has there ever been a more underrated word in the English language than “safe”? For something that is fundamentally a good thing, people can be weirdly dismissive about it. Eyes are rolled at workplace health and safety as though it’s somehow uncool to not lose a hand to poorly maintained machinery. Romcoms lazily wield it as an unflattering cliche: “Oh, I don’t know. My award-winning humanitarian of a partner is perfect in every conceivable way – but they’re just so … safe, you know?”Meanwhile, there’s no bigger cliche than being edgy just for the sake of trend-chasing. Over the past two decades, the fad for extreme sports has reached (and plummeted from) ever-crazier heights. Our fetishisation of high-risk, high-wire living has even spread to dining, with foodies flocking to increasingly ridiculous eateries simply because they look cool on social media. How many times have our friends told us they tried out a Hot New Place that wasn’t actually very good – while we pity their gullibility and coo soothing words such as: “Oh what a shame that insect-based menu wasn’t actually that delicious.”Spurred on by the peer pressure of social media and clickbait articles about patently daft new trends, people all too often act as if they’re playing a gigantic game of chicken. When they aren’t posting smiling holiday selfies from the post-nuclear wreckage of Chernobyl, they’re braving the latest Insta grooming trends that you just have to try – even if they leave you looking like you’ve had your eyebrows rubber stamped on to your face.The 21st century seems so unhinged, it feels as though it’s drastically in need of a friend to confiscate its phone and force-feed it a sensible mug of Horlicks. So as we enter a new decade, it’s time to wake up to the obvious truth that sometimes playing it safe might be the smarter option. Sure, it won’t necessarily make for great social media content or keep trend forecasters in business, but the tried and tested route at least offers proven enjoyment.But there are things out there that are just unfailingly brilliant – melted cheese, beaten-track holidays, every Bill Murray film ever made. These are just some of the reasons that “safe” should be something we embrace. Another is the obvious fact that safety keeps you, well, safe. Just consider all the revolutionary advances in car safety technology.The safe option is one that doesn’t lead to you royally screwing up. It’s a guaranteed good time. It’s not being afraid to use your critical faculties, shun desperate fads and to do something that you genuinely know to be great. It’s suiting yourself, no matter the pressure to do the same stuff that everyone else is talking about.It isn’t always easy. But increasingly, playing it safe is the boldest thing you can do.We’re under so much pressure to be edgy these days that we often overlook safer, more rewarding options. Here are some user-friendly safety tips to help you navigate modern lifeBinge-watching TVWe might be living through an extended golden age of television, but the explosion in edgy programming has also given us an awful lot of duds. So it can be all too easy to make a habit out of wasting 12 hours of your life. Protect yourself from another bad long-term relationship with a TV show by learning when to quit. Studios like to make a big splash on their opening, so if the first episode sucks, it isn’t going to get better from there on in. But what happens when you’re, say, four episodes in? One way to develop the discipline to quickly give up is to think of your time as an economic investment. Just because you’ve invested four hours, it makes no sense to invest more if there’s no likely payoff. Economists call this the “sunk cost fallacy”. Instead, focus on the future time you’ll gain rather than on the time you’ve already sunk.The beaten trackIt’s easy to have that once-in-a-lifetime holiday: go somewhere you’ll never, ever want to visit again. Plenty of people willingly do this in the name of adventure or to prove their alpha credentials. But there is much to be said for the relaxing and restorative joy of the safe, well-trodden path – such as comfortable beds, rainproof roofs and nice food. The trick to taking your first step back to the beaten track is to refrain from judging other people for choosing the tourist trail and package holidays – then hopefully you’ll stop judging yourself.Foodie warningSocial media and TV cookery shows have conspired to make food even more of a feast for our eyes than our taste buds. But trying to assess food’s deliciousness with your eyes is like trying to appreciate music with your mouth. It’s important to take food-based Instagram posts with a pinch of (figurative) salt, as some restaurants try to capitalise on these trends by creating dishes based around how they’ll look on social media. Avoid regrets by engaging in real conversation: if you see friends posting about having eaten somewhere that looks great, get in touch to check they actually rated the taste of the meal. Just because someone shares a pretty photo, it doesn’t make it a food recommendation.Before you startup, stopThe digital revolution has fuelled such a fixation with startups that it almost feels de rigueur to quit your job and start your own venture. Alternatively, you might be tempted to devote yourself full-time to your side hustle. Before you consider whether or not to take the plunge, one question you should ask yourself is whether the thing that you’re really fetishising is the idea of being a risk-taker rather than the venture itself. So be sure to scrutinise your real motivations. For instance, are you following your passion or your ego? And bear in mind that sometimes our egos are actually fuelled by feelings of insecurity.Savvy tech is safe techEach month brings a cacophony of new digital bells and whistles and it can be easy to simply dismiss them. So how do you sift useful tech from pointless tech? One tip is to ask whether or not the new app, gadget or feature will save you time, give you pleasure or make you safer. The latter question often gets overlooked. But when it comes to developments such as smart homes and in-car technology – including driver monitoring and assistance systems – making things safer is actually the main point.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

And these devices are already proving their worthWho hasn’t found their attention straying behind the wheel? Modern life is riddled with distractions that fight tooth and nail for our attention – whether it’s noisy children, garish adverts, tiredness, traffic cameras, personal pressures, endless to-do lists or those digital devices and social media notifications that we forgot to switch to silent. We always seem to be spreading our attention too thinly or are exhausted from having to think 10 different thoughts.This is one reason why the focus of vehicle safety design has shifted in recent years. Whereas in the past it was about applying materials and design to mitigate damage to occupants in crashes, it’s now about using the latest technology to prevent accidents happening in the first place. In short, it’s about cars that can take control when you have lost it.The shift in emphasis is often referred to as a switch from passive safety systems to active safety systems. Indeed, when it comes to cars, making things safer is one of the main drivers of tech developments. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) can aid concentration and alertness and encompass features including automated braking that relies on technologies such as radar, cameras and lasers. “ADAS has been a step change,” says Andrew Morris of Loughborough University’s Transport Safety Research Centre. “There was a consensus that human fallibility is hard to eradicate and that all passive systems can do is reduce damage. At that point, the focus shifted to prevention. New technology offers solutions in the shape of sensing and automation, which is a better philosophy because it also protects vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists.”Japanese carmaker Subaru has been at the forefront in the development of ADAS since 2013, when it introduced its “second pair of eyes”, the EyeSight system. This uses two sophisticated colour cameras mounted inside the car on the upper edge of the windshield above the rearview mirror. The system is capable of processing accurate stereo images to identify vehicles travelling in front, as well as obstacles, traffic lanes and other objects such as pedestrians.Using images generated by the cameras, EyeSight can run a suite of six ADAS:As with all the company’s core safety tech, EyeSight is continually evolving. For example, the Forester e-BOXER and Levorg now feature the EyeSight assist monitor, which provides a heads-up display of EyeSight system warnings for drivers to see more clearly.EyeSight is fitted as standard to all Subaru models, save the BRZ sports car. In 2019, the Forester e-BOXER achieved the maximum five-star Euro NCAP rating for safety and was declared “Best in Class 2019 in the Small Off-roadMPV Class”.Other Subaru safety systems include its Driver Monitoring System, which can detect the driver’s eyes closing or looking away for an extended period of time and trigger audio and visual warnings. This could be a potential lifesaver given that, according to Thatcham research centre, at least one fatal sleep-related crash occurs every day in the UK. Subaru’s Driver Monitoring System won the Technology Award at the 2020 What Car? Awards. What Car? praised the system, calling it “the most advanced of its kind”. In the tests, it proved to be more accurate at identifying when concentration was lost, compared with other manufacturer systems.Reverse Automatic Braking (RAB) and Subaru Rear Vehicle Detection also use sensors to spot potential objects behind the vehicle or in blind spots and RAB can even apply the brakes to avoid a collision.While driver distraction can be lethal, education and legislation – like the law banning handling a mobile phone – can only go so far.Full autonomy is some way off but, as of 2022, new safety technologies will become mandatory in cars and vans under EU law and are likely to be adopted in the UK – specifically lane-keeping assistance and advanced emergency braking. This will contribute to the long-term goal dubbed “Vision Zero”, of moving close to zero fatalities and serious injuries.But is eradicating all accidents possible through technology?“It’s very aspirational certainly and hard to achieve in the foreseeable future,” admits Morris. “However it’s a sound concept, a safe-system approach, which says if an accident happens for whatever reason we blame the system rather than the driver. And these systems will definitely become more effective as they are refined.”Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

Now, researchers say, they have found mice do too.“Mice exhibit facial expressions that are specific to the underlying emotions,” said Dr Nadine Gogolla, co-author of the research from Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology. She said the findings were important, as they offer researchers new ways to measure the intensity of emotional responses, which could help them probe how emotions arise in the brain.What’s more, she said, the findings show mice have a repertoire of emotions. Writing in the journal Science, Gogolla and colleagues report that they exposed mice to a mixture of triggers. These included electric shocks to the tail, sweet treats, and lithium chloride injections, which induced a state akin to nausea.While the authors say the facial movements that followed were noticeable, anyone hoping for a comical murine grimace may be disappointed.Indeed, rather like Ben Stiller’s Zoolander, the expressions appear very similar to the human eye – albeit with subtle differences. For example, compared with a neutral expression, a mouse’s ears lay further back and the position of its lower jaw and nose shifted when it had its tail zapped.To probe these expressions further, the team turned to computer vision technology that extracts features from different images, and quantifies differences between pictures.The software revealed clear differences between images of mice taken from before and after each trigger was applied, as well as differences between images captured during different types of trigger, suggesting the facial expression linked to a zapped tail was different to that manifested when a treat was given.Further work using average facial feature data relating to each trigger confirmed this, something the team say shows that the expressions reflect different emotional states, such as pleasure, disgust, nausea and pain – although fear linked to escape had a less distinct expression.The team also employed machine learning – a type of artificial intelligence that can recognise patterns and hence sort data into different groups.The team found that expressions could vary in duration and onset. while Mice pulled a stronger expression, relative to the average, when they were given a sweet sucrose drink when thirsty compared with when they were quenched. “It is not just a sucrose face we are eliciting,” said Gogolla. “The pleasure is higher when you are actually thirsty.”In a further twist, the team looked at brain regions previously associated with emotions in animals including mice, finding that if they stimulated areas linked to particular emotions, the mouse pulled the expected corresponding face. Again, machine learning could tell these apart.Writing in an accompanying commentary, experts Benoit Girard and Camilla Bellone say the new research could not only open up new ways to probe how emotions arise in the brain, but could also help researchers explore whether animals share information through their facial expressions, and how and why experiences of emotions may differ between iniduals.But Dr Susanne Schweizer, a neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge who was not involved in the work, said it was unclear whether the facial expressions of the mice truly reflected emotions, since they relate to short-lived physical experiences.“How do these experiences – if at all – relate to the emotional pain experienced when we are faced with loss, the pleasure we experience when we see a loved one succeed, or the sense of disgust we are overcome with when we hear about a moral transgression?” she said. “It would be fascinating to see if the effects can be reliably replicated in response to social stressors and positive social stimuli in mice.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80a68a50470acc7f245f16b96f6e8e5465ca9b80/0_88_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7690208c7749028283c07f713f7bf49e","title":"covid 19 recoveries it was the most terrifying experience of my life","story":"People in the UK who have returned to health after fighting off coronavirus tell their stories“I could tell the nurses were as scared as me they told me my coronavirus test was positive as if I was going to die,” says Ati, 41, who was admitted to hospital in Edinburgh after suffering from a fever, a constant cough, abdominal and chest pain, shortness of breath and the loss of her sense of smell and taste.She had initially been told by 111 call responders to nurse her symptoms at home, but was instructed to go to hospital after coughing up blood.On her third day in hospital – her 13th with the illness – Ati started bringing up more blood and felt an ever greater tightness in her chest as her temperature rose further. That night it started to fall.“To my surprise, it did not come back,” she recalls of the fever. “My body finally began to fight it off and the next day they told me I could go home the day after if everything stayed stable.“I was so relieved. I had kept thinking I should’ve been admitted earlier and feared it was too late. It was the most terrifying experience of my life.”More than 29,000 people across the UK are confirmed to have contracted Covid-19, and it is thought that thousands more have it. The disease has killed 2,352 people in the UK so far.Meanwhile, 174,019 people globally are known to have recovered. The number in the UK remains unclear, but heartening reports are beginning to emerge.“I actually got out of bed today, which is huge,” says 51-year-old Lou, in Chalfont St Peter in Buckinghamshire. “I thought I was dying Wednesday last week, when I couldn’t take a breath and was losing consciousness.”Paramedics who came to Lou’s house found that her temperature exceeded 104F (40C) and her blood pressure and oxygen intake had dropped. She was rushed to hospital along with her husband, who was also symptomatic. She was tested for Covid-19 on Friday and is still awaiting her results.In hospital she was put on a drip and given a variety of drugs, and her condition stabilised. She was discharged several days later as the choking feeling began to ease and her fever subsided.“It makes you think: sod bloody work. When this is over, we are having fun,” she says. “It’s baby steps, but we are slowly getting there.”Only patients with the worst symptoms are being admitted to hospital, and 22-year-old Ryan is among many whom 111 call handlers have told to stay at home and self-isolate unless they have severe difficulties breathing.“I’m very relieved I recovered,” says Ryan, a third-year engineering student at Imperial College London, telling of coughing red phlegm, exhaustion, night sweats and nausea. “I couldn’t get out of bed when the fever was at its worst. I lost my appetite and could barely drink water.”He says he is usually healthy and that the ordeal has been a big shock. Now he just wants to return to his home country, Malaysia. Jenny, 59, a former GP in Falkirk who has multiple sclerosis, isolated herself from her vulnerable family and has since been able to resume normal life.Although she is still quite fatigued and has to stop to catch her breath while walking through her village, she has now returned to caring for her partner, who is undergoing chemotherapy, and her father, who has dementia.Jenny stresses her desire to give people optimism about recovery and the importance of isolating if you have symptoms. “Every single one of us can make a difference in the flattening of the epidemic curve,” she says.For Ati, the episode has given her a new sense of community.“We started to see messages from neighbours, my GP and friends offering help,” she says. “It was so comforting to see how society comes together.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80758955bea8ede10485416a89c36e7ea6270ecb/0_98_4368_2621/master/4368..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be9b7ed9fff7038e5c6077df29c0da2f","title":"its time nurses got the recognition they deserve","story":"Nurses are highly competent clinicians who must be treated with respect, writes Prof Louise Condon, while one anonymous reader describes student nurses undertaking long shifts with no pay and another feels her skills are not being valuedWhen are our government and hospital trusts going to stop exploiting our student nurses? Current third-year student nurses are paying over £9,000 a year in course fees. They do not receive a bursary (unlike any other cohort before or after them), relying on student maintenance loans and working additional bank shifts as healthcare assistants to make ends meet.While paying £9,000 a year they are still on placement, working on wards where they can come into contact with Covid-19 patients, but are told they are no longer supernumerary and are receiving nothing from the universities, which are closed.In a nutshell, they are not only working 12-hour shifts without being paid but are actually paying to do so. All while risking their own health, if not their lives, and that of their families. In addition, they are working bank shifts for not much more than a minimum wage, with no sick pay, just to make ends meet. To add insult to injury, trusts are charging car parking fees of up to £10 a day!Having written to my MP, Andrew Mitchell, I am still waiting for a response. Please can we start to show our gratitude to this small army of dedicated and skilled nurses, and stop expecting them to do all of this and pay for it too. Without our student nurses the NHS will simply be overwhelmed. Please also be aware that student nurses have been told by their universities that they will face disciplinary action if they speak to the media.Name and address supplied• Nurses will be “sent to London” but doctors will be “asked” to stay overnight in hospital (Nurses sent to London as capital faces ‘tsunami’ of virus patients, 26 March). Reading on, it seems that both groups will be asked to volunteer their services.Casual disrespecting of nurses abounds in the current reporting of the pandemic. Nurses are the biggest professional group in the NHS (there are around 300,000 nurses, compared with around 150,000 doctors) and provide the majority of care, but are still invariably described as practising in a subordinate role. Nursing care is vital and frequently highly specialised, such as in intensive care units – in both acute and primary care some nurses work on medical rotas, at the same level as junior doctors (advanced nurse practitioners).When will the media wake up to the fact that nurses are not angels but highly competent clinicians? We care for patients in partnership with the whole healthcare team (including the rarely mentioned healthcare support workers, allied health professionals, paramedics and clinical scientists). The NHS doesn’t just run on doctors, so please treat us all with respect.Louise CondonProfessor of nursing, Swansea University• Last week, even before the government was talking about mass screening, I wrote to my local clinical care commissioning group asking them if they could use someone like me to help with screening. I am a 61-year-old retired nurse and have worked across both hospital and community in an almost 40-year career. I don’t fit the requirements for the original recall for healthcare professionals as I’ve been off the Nursing and Midwifery Counci register for more than three years. I was sent a polite response saying NHS England would be a better place to enquire, then an email saying Public Health England would be a better option – but I’ve not heard a thing. I’ve registered for the NHS volunteer scheme, but feel I have another skill set that could be useful in this time of crisis.

This huge golfing institution, presiding over one of the staples of the British sporting summer, felt compelled to react to a report claiming the 149th Open is set for cancellation. The missive from the office of Martin Slumbers didn’t actually mention the c-word at all.“We are continuing to work through our options for the Open this year, including postponement,” said the R\u0026ampA’s chief executive. “Due to a range of external factors, that process is taking some time to resolve. We are well aware of the importance of being able to give clear guidance to fans, players and everyone involved and are working to resolve this as soon as we can. We will give a further update as soon as we are in a position to do so.”Being kind, this could be labelled a holding statement. If “external factors” are key, one is left to ponder how much control the R\u0026ampA has of its golden goose. It was reported days earlier that postponement of the tournament, scheduled for Royal St George’s in mid-July, was borderline inevitable. Forensic detective work was hardly required to deduce that much. The suggestion of cancellation, somewhat curiously, rattled Slumbers or those close to him sufficiently to deliver an example of words that say nothing at all.If the R\u0026ampA doesn’t know precisely what to do about this year’s Open, something is seriously amiss. Sport has been paralysed by coronavirus, with events and seasons dropping from billboards one by one. It is fanciful to suggest the Kent coast can – or should, in respect of public services – host 200,000 visitors and global competitors in a golf event in little over three months’ time. The R\u0026ampA, for its many faults, cannot be ignorant over a pandemic.At the very least, if not providing a full explanation of contingency, the R\u0026ampA should have put a public line through Sandwich in its standard slot long before now spectators alone deserve that much. Augusta National is still to issue detail of a 2020 Masters alternative but it was swift in postponing when coronavirus took hold. That the United States Golf Association hasn’t ditched plans for the US Open in New York in June catapults golf into territory beyond Clubhouse Cuckoo Land. They and the R\u0026ampA set the rules for this game, you know.Which isn’t, of course, to suggest complications don’t exist. The R\u0026ampA is just glacial in dealing with them. In professional golf, not uniquely, key deliberations relate to a word starting with “m” and rhyming with honey.There has been speculation regarding the R\u0026ampA’s insurance provision, say, which may ensure a fiscal gulf between cancellation or postponement. The new date window itself is small September is realistically the latest month in which the Open could be held, with even that subject to daylight restrictions either curtailing the field or triggering two-tee starts.With every body in professional golf – the R\u0026ampA, USGA, PGA of America, Augusta National, PGA Tour and European Tour – fighting to play their tournaments, negotiations will be inevitably messy. Television companies, bereft of material yet heavy investors in golf, will have a seat at the table.Royal St George’s will not readily give up their first Open since 2011. Nor will the local economy it brings an estimated £100m worth of benefits. Yet the notion of just bumping Sandwich into 2021 is an uneasy one. St Andrews, Royal Liverpool and Royal Troon are already set in stone as venues for the three following years.The R\u0026ampA has a weird obsession with anniversaries St Andrews was to stage the 150th playing of the Open, with 2023 marking 100 years since Troon’s first one. The calendar can of course be shuffled around but it’s messy, including in respect of Hoylake, where vast ticket sales send the R\u0026ampA’s bean counters into a state of delirium.We assume that, by next weekend, overdue clarity will have been provided by the R\u0026ampA. The Open in July will bite the dust in slow, clunking, ultra-serious form. Twas ever thus. The solution will be far more interesting than the inevitable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ff97c93d96ff8e2e779ee403709094e5d1770f6/54_61_1550_930/master/1550..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1cc18182fcaa2959113a65f1381323e","title":"elite sports coronavirus cricket football","story":"It is 100 years since Britain’s sports grounds were last used to treat the sick – none of us expected it to happen in our lifetimeIn the last months of the first world war, a ship arrived at Manchester from the US, its passengers deathly ill. They were mostly southerners, infected with a powerful influenza that had overtaken them on their transatlantic journey and quickly turned into pneumonia. The matron of a nearby Red Cross hospital, Mrs Geldart, heard of their plight and took them in, at no small risk to the health of her own – mostly voluntary – staff. For the next 12 weeks her hospital struggled and suffered through the deadliest trial it had faced in four years of war.Many patients did not recover. Those who did took rehabilitative walks on the oval sward of grass they could see from their ward windows. Their beds took up every available inch of floor space in the Old Trafford pavilion: the long room, the dressing rooms, the corridors, and even, when weather permitted, the roof. It was only a short stroll to the cricket pitch, and no one told the convalescents off for walking on it. Lancashire’s players weren’t using it.It is 100 years since Britain’s sports grounds were last used to treat the sick. Some of our grandparents will have heard the tales, from their parents, of the dire need that pressed stadiums – as well as schools, hotels, and country houses – into service during the first world war. Some of us have seen the black-and-white photographs, in books or museums, of caped nurses hovering near bandaged soldiers, enamel pans by their side. None of us expected it to happen in our own lifetime.And yet it has. This week we learned that Cardiff’s Principality Stadium – the home of Welsh rugby – is being turned into a 2,000-bed field hospital to help ease the pressure on the NHS as coronavirus begins to peak. Wembley and the Football Association training ground at St George’s Park are likely to become NHS storage space that frees up more room on inundated wards. Lord’s is already helping out four north London facilities with parking and rest areas for their medical staff. Manchester City have donated the use of the Etihad Stadium to train doctors and nurses working on the frontline, Chelsea are providing accommodation, and Silverstone has offered its medical centre. Twickenham – where the West Stand was filled with hospital beds during the second world war, in preparation for a chemical attack on London that never came – also stands ready.More clubs and grounds are expected to answer the call – particularly after London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, wrote on Monday to the city’s Premier League and Championship clubs asking for their support, in the form of both medical equipment and clinically trained personnel from their backroom staff. Deep pockets and a wealth of technical resources mean elite sports have plenty to offer the national effort. Who knew, for instance, that a Formula One team such as Mercedes could be so quickly repurposed to create breathing aids? Or realised, until a few weeks ago, that we would need such ingenuity?But then nor did our great-grandparents, at the outbreak of the Great War, the one supposed to be over by Christmas. Initial calculations suggested a total of 50,000 beds would be enough to treat the men returning from action. By the end of 1914 there were 73,000 wounded back in England. When Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club’s home ground opened as an auxiliary hospital on 9 December 1914, the seriousness of the conflict was beginning to be understood.Trent Bridge’s first patients were 20 servicemen from the Western Front, suffering from frostbite. Over the course of the next four and a half years the hospital’s 36 beds grew to 200, and it treated more than 3,500 people. Women had been banned from the Trent Bridge pavilion before the war – hence the existence, on the Hound Road side of the ground, of a separate (and less comfortable) Ladies Pavilion. From 1914 to 1919 both buildings were staffed and run almost entirely by female volunteers, most of whom had no previous experience of work at all.Many were single women who had never been in the company of men unchaperoned. They were directed in their efforts by a doctor who also happened to be the club’s cricket captain, Dr George Ogg Gauld, and the entire operation was overseen by two formidable and supremely competent commandants, Lady Bruce and Henrietta Hayman. Nottinghamshire paid tribute to them during last year’s centenary, with a plaque commemorating the “women and men” – in that order – who worked at the hospital.We look back and see an era when the nation changed out of necessity, and found itself grateful for people and skills it had never before valued. Perhaps we can hope for the same today. This is a rare moment in our national life when our appreciation for healthcare workers outstrips our collective obsession with millionaire footballers. And while the wartime efforts may be beyond our living memory, their stories remain to inspire us.In a 1928 memoir, Lancashire’s dressing-room attendant William Howard recalled working at the Old Trafford pavilion hospital. It was his saddest experience in cricket, particularly when the American flu victims arrived and he was required to “make provision” for those not expected to last the night. “Being accustomed to look upon this place as the home of cricket,” he said, “it was most pathetic to see men pass away so quickly: it was more like the home of death.”Yet throughout the hardship he saw much that uplifted him, from the great efforts to make soldiers comfortable to extraordinary resourcefulness (including from his own wife, who knocked up some rudimentary face masks on her sewing machine). “The response to the appeal for necessary articles required to equip the hospital proved that the British public are generous,” he wrote. “It would be impossible to speak too highly of the staff.”Lord’s, too, was equipped as a Red Cross hospital in the Great War. Two decades later it was used for more military purposes, becoming RAF recruiting centre during the second world war.

Our writer reports on his role in the webcam drama‘Would you like to take part in a livestreamed performance of a Shakespeare play?” An innocent enough request, and tempting in these monochrome, locked-down times. At first I think I am being offered a part in Henry IV Part I, a very good play I dimly remember from A-level. Perhaps I could play the fiery Hotspur. But I realise it is actually Henry VI Part I – early Shakespeare, co-written with others, and reckoned by some to be the Bard’s weakest number. Oh well, you have to start somewhere. In any case it is too late. The die is cast, and so am I.The enterprising director is Robert Myles, whose response to the lockdown has been to set about mounting the entire Shakespearean canon in chronological order, livestreaming a play a week on YouTube under the banner of The Show Must Go Online. He’d done two already – The Two Gentlemen of Verona and The Taming of the Shrew – but this was to be the first history. Whether it would make history was another matter.Why attempt this epic undertaking? “I lost a gig that was going to take me to the end of April,” Myles tells me, “and it soon became apparent the same thing was happening to every actor.” He decided to plug the gap. Rehearsals and the production are all done on Zoom.I suggest I should play the title role, but Myles points out Henry is only nine months old when he succeeds to the throne and this might be beyond even my acting skills. I get the part of the Duke of Burgundy instead. Burgundy doesn’t have many lines but he does play a pivotal role, since switching his allegiance from the English to the French is crucial in turning the tide in this phase of the Hundred Years War. My ego is satisfied. I also quickly come to realise that 40 lines spread across half-a-dozen scenes is about my limit.The play is largely impenetrable, with various English nobles vying for influence over the child king. “This one has been a beast!” Myles tells his 25-strong cast – mostly professionals but with the odd am-dram enthusiast too, playing more than 60 roles and Zooming in from all over the world. I decide not to worry about what the Dukes of Gloucester, Somerset and Bedford are up to, and concentrate on my role instead.Myles tells us at the outset that he is playing it straight and not sending it up (which I would be very tempted to do) but there will still be lots of opportunities for on screen business, with castle walls made out of cardboard, plenty of alarums, battles and funeral processions, some lurid “furies” putting in an appearance when Joan of Arc (who has galvanised the French forces) has a vision, and an array of silly hats.With Myles’s blessing, I decide to play Burgundy wearing a leather hat with ear muffs – the closest thing to a helmet I can find, even if it does make me look like an aviator. I also attempt an unusual reading of the role. The text portrays Burgundy as being converted to the French cause by Joan of Arc, but since she manages this in the space of two short speeches I find it implausible and decide he was looking for a pretext to switch sides. A brilliant reading, if based on nothing much more than a hunch.“Subtext doesn’t mix well with Shakespeare,” Myles tells me, “but I’m happy for you to do what you need to commit fully to a characterisation you can take ownership of. I think the clues that he’s ultimately self-serving are there in the text.” We are as one on the interpretation, though judging by the balls-up I make of the final rehearsal – making entrances when I should be making exits and vice versa – the subtleties of textual exegesis are probably the least of my worries.I am horribly nervous before the virtual curtain goes up and panic when my Zoom fails 20 minutes before we are due to go live. But producer Sarah Peachey restores my link and calms my nerves, and I settle in to follow the play on paper and speak my lines from chunks of on-screen text. At one point, trying to switch from paper to screen, I lose track of where we are, but just about find my place in time to speak my lines.What I can’t do is act (no surprise there), spending all my time making sure I’m using the mute button properly, appearing on screen when I’m supposed to, and delivering my lines. I am listening neither to myself nor to my fellow actors, and am in awe of those who manage to achieve so much locked in their bedrooms, with so little rehearsal time and in a tiny space on screen. There are some truly wonderful performances, though sadly mine is not among them.Myles and Peachey move on to Henry VI Part II next week, and have more than 30 plays ahead of them – they are clearly planning for a lengthy lockdown. They encourage me to consider applying for a role in a future production. I wonder if the world is ready for my Hamlet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bff69e0bbbb30b8208e5cf600194108ad3e615ae/0_233_4339_2603/master/4339..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=953d8ce38488de4a7e3d366609ee20d9","title":"twitter accounts deleted linked saudi arabia serbia egypt governments","story":"Accounts also linked to Honduras and Indonesia violated policy and were ‘targeted attempt to undermine the public conversation’Twitter has deleted 20,000 fake accounts linked to the governments of Serbia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Honduras and Indonesia, saying they violated company policy and were a “targeted attempt to undermine the public conversation”.Yoel Roth, the head of site integrity, said the removal of the accounts was part of the company’s ongoing “work to detect and investigate state-backed information operations”.Of the accounts removed on Thursday, 8,558 were linked to the Serbian Progressive party (SNS) of Aleksandar Vučić, the president. The accounts had posted more than 43m tweets amplifying positive news coverage of Vučić’s government and attacking his political opponents.Twitter also removed a network of 5,350 accounts linked to the Saudi monarchy operating out of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Together they had tweeted 36.5m times praising the Saudi leadership or criticising Qatar and Turkish activity in Yemen.The takedown of the accounts followed a tip from the Stanford Internet Observatory, which said that network had also generated tweets supportive of the Libyan warlord Khalifa Haftar.“Prominent narratives included discrediting recent Libyan peace talks, criticizing the Syrian government, criticizing Iranian influence in Iraq, praising the Mauritanian government, and criticism of Houthi rebels in Yemen,” the observatory said in a blogpost.A separate Egyptian network of 2,541 accounts linked to the pro-government El Fagr newspaper, was also removed. Twitter said that the fake accounts had been used to “amplify messaging critical of Iran, Qatar and Turkey”.The social media company deleted more than 3,000 accounts which it said had been traced to a staffer working for the Honduran president, Juan Orlando Hernández.“Much of the tweet behavior seems targeted at drowning out negative news about the Honduran president by promoting presidential initiatives and heavily retweeting the president and news outlets favorable to his administration,” the Stanford Internet Observatory said.Following up reporting by investigative journalists at Bellingcat, the company said it had removed 795 fake accounts promoting the Indonesian government and targeting the West Papuan independence movement.Twitter has purged networks of state-backed fake accounts since coming under criticism for being used as a vehicle for disinformation. Last month Twitter took joint action with Facebook and to disable a Moscow-linked operation aimed at inflaming racial tensions in the US, as the social media companies sought to respond to pressure to block attempted Russian interference in the 2020 presidential elections.“Transparency is fundamental to the work we do at Twitter,” a company statement said. “These behaviors are in violation of our policies and are a targeted attempt to undermine the public conversation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3aac59cb380a484e7595567ea6c424ed0929745/0_0_6480_3888/master/6480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a3d3a23b756896383c506bc2b053dc7","title":"10 of the best places to revisit after lockdown readers travel tips","story":"Some places stand as monuments to recovery, others inspire our readers with their beauty – or the wisdom of the ancientsTen years ago we were at Epidaurus, and each took turns to descend to the orchestra and read from Sophocles or Euripides – among the wisest writers of all time.

When the dust has settled it would be good to revisit and remind ourselves of some of the eternal wisdoms and pleasures.Mary O’KeeffeIn 2013 I visited Christchurch, a city slowly emerging from the crisis of the 2011 earthquakes. Things appeared normal until you noticed the cracks, jaunty angles and misaligned lintels. The spray paint from the rescue teams was still visible on shops the empty white chairs, one for every life lost, stood wistfully in the centre, and the beautiful cathedral was fenced off in disrepair. But the vibrant Re:start mall and its indie shops, chilled buskers, Lego-adorned coffee cabins and rainbow flowerpots were the first signs of the resilience of this bohemian city. In a time where we need to focus on recovery and a brighter future, I look forward to seeing what Christchurch becomes.Anna KennettSainte-Marine, near Combrit, is a stunning part of Brittany. We went there on a family holiday in 2017, driving through Normandy, staying in Honfleur and Rennes on the way. We rented a cottage about 500 metres from the sea and 750 metres from the village centre. Sainte-Marine boasts a beautiful harbour, a patisserie and lots of fabulous harbour-front restaurants where you can sip a glass of local cider, gorge on moules et frites and people-watch to your heart’s content. The beach is stunning, with amazing walks around the coast.Trish Every week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

Make the trek up to the Piazzale Michelangelo, collecting bread, cheese and wine from the amazing market first. Then head back down to marvel at the Duomo, and walk the streets looking for the Medici balls on the buildings. No trip would be complete without a visit to David. Turning into the long room and seeing the statue at the end simply takes your breath away. Even in the crowded streets and the museums, you feel totally alone with beauty. CathThe area west of Lough Corrib in Connemara has some of the most breathtaking scenery not just in Ireland, but in the world. The Twelve Bens and Maumturk mountains provide the backdrop to myriad pools, lakes and rivers that glint and reflect the sky, lush greenery and brown hues of the blanket bog. Near the peninsulas you can find some of the most picturesque villages (Roundstone) and finest beaches (Doonloughan). As well as some of the freshest and tastiest seafood. The people are warm and welcoming and the Guinness is fabulous. PhelI’ve been all round the world, but found nowhere better than Tresco in the Isles of Scilly. It’s the Caribbean of the UK – white sand beaches, palm trees and no traffic. Just a short hop from Land’s End airport or a ferry ride from Penzance, so no queues or customs to worry about. See the exotic Abbey Garden with flowers from around the world, recently introduced red squirrels and the Valhalla maritime museum. There are five-star restaurants and places to stay, and you can walk your socks off or hop on a boat to one of the other islands. I just hope this remains as it is, a little paradise on Earth.Nigel KentI rented a lodge at Clachan Sands on North Uist with some friends for my 50th birthday. The views on to the beach changed every day, with white sand and myriad blues in the sea and sky. We were able to take epic walks, luckily mostly in sunshine, bought langoustines fresh off the fishing boat and had delicious meals at Berneray Bistro. Take a boat ride to the Isle of Harris, where there are more enormous beaches and the gin distillery. We saw sea otters, eagles, seals and red deer. It is the place to go if you need some big sky.Emma WellmanLast July, my partner and I spent two nights in Aarhus. It was booked as a surprise for both of us, and neither of us knew what to expect. It turned out to be the annual Jazz Festival. For a week, any venue that can host jazz in the city does. You wander from small bars to parks to libraries and take in the music. When you’re not bebopping, you can eat amazing Nordic cuisine. The most astounding thing was that the whole city got involved and just had fun. No bust-ups, just jazz. (And beer.) MichaelWhen all this is over, I want to go back to Eyam, a peaceful place of greensward and church surrounded by birdsong and chocolate-box cottages, and be reassured of what is possible, even after pandemics. I’ve been thinking about the plague-ridden villagers of 350 years ago, who wrestled with our issues of choosing self-isolation. And I’ll go back to the museum to be reminded of the local inventor of silk processes, Ralph Wain, and how industry and creativity can bring communities back to life after tragedy.

As one tour operator says, how firms respond will shape whether or not they have a futureFor the past two weeks we’ve addressed several questions in our Q\u0026ampA but increasingly readers want to know the answer to just one: can I get a refund? We answered one specific query on this last week and my colleague Miles Brignall also outlined consumer rights in this piece. But as it keeps being raised, we thought it worth addressing again.Under the Package Travel Regulations (PTR), you are entitled to a refund if your holiday provider cannot fulfil the holiday but – and it’s a big but – tour operators are struggling to meet this legal obligation while facing a massive loss of income and, in some cases, repatriation costs.In short, the travel industry is in freefall. It has weathered problems from natural disasters to terrorism to recession, but nothing comes close to the Covid-19 crisis, which is disastrous for countries and tourist destinations all over the world. A ludicrous, hypothetical scenario – what would happen if no one could travel? – is now a shocking and surreal reality.Of course, many sectors are on perilous ground, but the knock-on effects of this global paralysis are arguably worse for travel. The World Travel \u0026amp Tourism Council (WTTC) estimates that a million jobs are being lost every day in the travel and tourism sector because of the pandemic.“From waiters to taxi drivers, tour guides to chefs and caterers, pilots to cleaners, the relentless cascade of job losses is plunging millions of families into terrible hardship and debt. The domino effect of Covid-19 is right now having a massive impact, wiping out an entire economic sector,” said WTTC president and CEO Gloria Guevara.As Brignall says, you should keep contacting your travel provider for a refund. If the government acts on calls from Abta for the refund window to be extended from 14 days to four months, you will wait longer for the money.But tour operators are pleading with customers to postpone instead of cancelling, warning that mass cancellations will lead to a meltdown of the sector. Credit notes are protected in the same way as holidays and if the company does go under, the Atol scheme means you will be compensated.He also said he doesn’t support Abta’s call for changes to the PTR rules and believes there is “a lot of love being lost between the travel industry and consumers. If customers bought under those terms, they should be honoured.”For some tour operators that is simply not possible. They are being asked to give full refunds for air-inclusive holidays, often without being able to recoup money from airlines – leaving tour operators out of pocket. “Until governments step up, and bring the airlines to heel, the consumer has to rely on the quit wits and sympathy of small tour operators,” said Douglas Durrant of Caribbean Fun Travel.As Bruce sees it, this is a test of loyalty – those companies that work with customers during this challenging time will be the ones that benefit in the long term.“There are a lot of travel companies making rash decisions, and they may not come out of this looking too rosy at the end. This is about treating customers well so the terms know who to trust when this passes.”That is small comfort if you are trying to get money back right now, but worth bearing in mind when you come to book a future holiday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa3b78f8faecfa509c17c1f61ab0464d39bdb49a/0_239_5030_3020/master/5030.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8b7aecb09fb1e4af3ee91a1ef68d5c6","title":"send tip favourite travel souvenir win 200 pounds sawdays stay","story":"Tell us about something you picked up on your travels that brings back great memories or takes you back in timeGiven that we’re all stuck at home for who knows how long, our travel memories are especially poignant.

Now, as the documentary Slay the Dragon arrives, Katie Fahey’s hoping the momentum is replicated in other statesFor many years Michigan was ided evenly along party lines – a checkerboard of red and blue every election. Then, in 2011, Michigan’s Republican party legally rigged the system. Charged with drawing new district lines, the lawmakers did so with unprecedented precision – carving unnatural boundaries to keep their favored voters and locales in hand – to guarantee a majority for their party.It worked perfectly. The process of creating these doctored maps, known as gerrymandering, resulted in widespread victories for the Republicans. The party controlled almost every level of government, from the state supreme court to municipal workers. And with tangible impact on Michigan’s people: the Flint water crisis, which killed 12 people, happened because party legislators appointed emergency managers whom voters opposed.But in 2016, a then 26-year-old with no political experience uprooted the system.Katie Fahey hates politics. She can’t stand cable news punditry. She has little confidence in any of the 2020 presidential candidates. And she refuses to identify with a political party. But she dedicated two years of her life to launching and leading a grassroots campaign that started with a Facebook post and, against the odds, ended gerrymandering in Michigan.“Part of the problem we have right now is everybody’s looking for a savior, whether it’s an inidual politician or a political party,” Fahey said. “We as a whole aren’t working as hard to make sure that our voice is staying at the table and that we are watching what’s being done.”In hindsight, it’s easy to see why thousands flocked to her passionate message in Michigan – and why film-makers found Fahey the perfect anchor for their gerrymandering documentary Slay the Dragon, named for the oddly shaped district in Massachusetts created by the man who gerrymandering its name, former vice-president Elbridge Gerry. The film arrives on demand on 3 April.But for Fahey, being a young woman and a political outsider meant she faced an uphill battle to reform the redistricting process every step of the way.Fahey’s political frustration reached a boiling point after the 2016 presidential election. She had flown from Michigan to New York in a red pantsuit on 8 November, expecting to celebrate the first female president at Hillary Clinton campaign’s watch party. Instead, she was left stunned by Donald Trump’s victory. And she dreaded spending Thanksgiving with her extended, politically ided family in their home town just outside Grand Rapids.Born Katie Rogala, her family mostly steered clear of politics during her childhood in Caledonia, Michigan (population: 1,527), though her dad’s veteran status meant patriotism surrounded them. Fahey considered herself an independent, and worked at a recycling coalition after college, doing improvisational comedy – even starting an improv festival from scratch. (She married her improv co-star Sean Fahey in 2013, but the pair recently orced.)That year, eager to find a unifying topic to focus on over turkey and stuffing, Fahey turned her attention to gerrymandering. “I didn’t want to talk about who we voted for because that was always leading back to literally people being like, ‘You’re evil for thinking that way,’” Fahey said. “So I thought, man, I wonder if systemic reform, getting back to one person, one vote would be something that appeals to everybody.”While the practice of politicians redrawing district lines in their favor dates to the early 1800s in Massachusetts, recent technology has taken gerrymandering in America to the extreme. Now, following each decennial census count, it’s legal for state politicians to hire mapmakers to use software that precisely manipulates bizarrely squiggled districts – resembling everything from a praying mantis to Goofy kicking Donald Duck – to cram their opponents into a limited area or otherwise guarantee votes.Michigan is one of the most gerrymandered states in the US. Leaked emails have even revealed a Republican aide boasted about packing “Dem garbage” into select districts during the 2011 GOP legislative redrawing.On 11 November 2016, Fahey posted a Facebook status: “I’d like to take on gerrymandering in Michigan, if you’re interested in doing this as well, please let me know :).” Within hours, she’d created a new Facebook group and soon, the non-partisan Voters Not Politicians (VNP) was born. Fahey was the face of a movement. Well, almost.For the next few months, Fahey never met her supporters. They strategized and bonded online, something Fahey said helped build her confidence because “it’s easier to be vulnerable behind a screen”. But by March 2017, she and her fellow volunteers were ready to hold meetings across the state asking residents how they would like to see a new redistricting system work.It’s in those meetings that Fahey’s improv experience came in handy. She had an ease onstage, and in front of crowds – rumors even circulated that she was a paid actor, a plant supplied by the Democrats and that her whole Facebook-origin story was an elaborate hoax. “A lot of people were more skeptical and more dismissive of us being able to be the ‘real deal’ because of my age and gender,” she said.Voters Not Politicians’ final proposal emerged after 33 days: take the power out of the politicians’ hands, starting with the 2021 redistricting, by creating a 13-person citizens’ committee, composed of four Republicans, four Democrats and five unaffiliated people.But that was just the beginning. To get it on the ballot as a proposed constitutional amendment in the November 2018 midterm election, they would need 315,000 signatures in the next 180 days and, with limited funds and virtually no experience, they were starting at a huge disadvantage. “Normally, before you’d announce, you’d have your constitutional language written and you would have raised millions of dollars,” Fahey says. “Literally, we had just opened our bank account the day before because we couldn’t figure out how.”An undeterred and perpetually smiling Fahey led 4,000 volunteers, many of whom had also never been politically active, to contribute their skills, down to the woodcarver who helped make their clipboards. Jennifer Lawrence and Arnold Schwarzenegger chimed in with support. Even Republican voters and legislators were eager to sign and “the only people who would ever say no were usually people who were involved in the redistricting process before or somehow really, really involved in partisan politics”.“Without Katie, I believe, we would not have been successful,” said Hal Gurian, a Republican from Traverse City who volunteered for the campaign. “She was a hands-on leader who worked diligently with as many volunteers as she had time to meet personally or talk with on the phone.”“People don’t realize their own power. A lot of people, especially women, in the campaign, were so reluctant to go into leadership positions,” Fahey says, noting that after the campaign ended “we had, like, 17 people who ended up running for local office”.Next year, Michigan’s district lines will be redrawn by voters, not politicians for the first time.Slay the Dragon will be released this week during a census year – when the US population will be carefully counted in order to determine the size of electoral districts next year.It’s clear that Fahey’s hard-won movement is a threat to Republicans across the country during that process. Michigan’s Republican party and activists continue to try and block the change with multiple lawsuits, claiming it is unconstitutional and discriminatory.But Fahey is hoping the momentum from VNP can be replicated in the 35 other states that still use congressional redistricting. She self-identifies as a “democracy entrepreneur”. (That label worn by anyone else could seem insufferable, but on Fahey, who radiates an infectious earnestness, it works.) And she founded a national not-for-profit last year called the People, which hopes to create Katie 2.0s across the country by giving frustrated citizens the tools to tackle systemic issues they care about, such as the partisan primary process and election security.To be successful, those initiatives might need people like Katie at the forefront. “She is an inspiring, motivating and tireless leader,” Gurian said.While the impact of her work can’t be measured quite yet, the ripple effects are clear. In early March, the Democrat-majority Virginia senate voted to relinquish their power in favor of a committee. Groups in Nebraska, Oregon, Arkansas and Oklahoma are currently pushing for reform.Meanwhile Fahey keeps a surprisingly low profile from her home in Grand Rapids, which she shares with three rescue dogs. Though her platform started with a Facebook post, she has no public Instagram and a modest Twitter presence. Even the fact that she’s the face of Slay the Dragon doesn’t sit well with her. And don’t expect her to run for office anytime soon. “I’d be more excited about governing than I would about running or feeling like I have to follow the party line because that’s just not me,” she said.For now, she spends what little free time she has taking her dogs to the park or escaping from “real-world problems” with video games. Role-playing fantasies are her favorite, including, of course, Dragon Quest.“I think what I like about them is – this is so dumb – you have these different characters who all play their role and even if there is a main character, your team is only stronger because everybody’s bringing their strengths to the table,” she says.“That is just so how I live my life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32b8a510a84ee6edb5c03f30110e293008834239/0_0_960_576/master/960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e532867b713a9cd57f614139c1d310e2","title":"navajo nation grassroots self help coronavirus","story":"Women are leading a volunteer effort to care for elders and vulnerable people across the tribe’s vast, poorly served territoryIn mid-March, shortly after the Navajo Nation declared a public health state of emergency, Ethel Branch went out to stock up on supplies for her elderly mother and nieces who live on the Native American reservation.Branch, who lives in Flagstaff, Arizona, spent all day going from store to store trying to find canned soups, soap and toilet paper. Many had sold out, while others were price gouging amid rising panic about the coronavirus pandemic.Branch started calling friends looking for ideas about how to ensure the tribe’s most vulnerable families got enough food, water and hygiene supplies without risking their lives by traveling long distances.With these harsh realities in mind, Branch and her friends created the Navajo \u0026amp Hopi Families Covid-19 Relief Fund, and started a GoFundMe page.By Thursday, $267,000 had been donated and a small army of volunteers was coordinating a full-scale emergency response to distribute crucial supplies to needy families across the vast Navajo territory and the neighboring Hopi reservation, where three small convenience stores serve almost 3,000 people.So far, more than 2,000 households have registered for help – some online but most by calling a call center volunteer who asks them about how much food they have left, allergies and medical needs, in order to prioritize orders.Hundreds of care packages – containing core items such as flour, beans, rice, canned soups, dried meat, fever and cough medicine, as well as fresh vegetables, fruit and meat when available, have been delivered to elders caring for grandchildren and people with pre-existing medical conditions. Fifty went to Chilchinbeto, a close-knit community of 500 people which has been locked down since the first localized spread was detected.The volunteer effort is an example of what the Navajo call T’áá hwó ajít’éego, or self-reliance and self-determination.“There’s no fixed model, we do what needs to be done, to get supplies where they are needed as fast and safely as possible through our network,” Branch told the .The volunteer – and government – efforts are a mammoth task given the size and geography of the Nation which stretches 27,000 square miles over the south-western Colorado plateau across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. The territory, which is roughly the size of West Virginia, includes arid deserts and alpine forests with high plateaus, mesas and mountains reaching over 10,000ft in altitude.In addition to economic and topographic challenges, the coronavirus pandemic represents particular risks to the Navajo – and other tribal nations – as rates of cancer, heart and respiratory diseases and diabetes are comparatively higher than in the non-Native populations, while tribal health services have been underfunded for decades.Amid growing concern, the Navajo government issued a shelter-in-place order on 21 March – two days after California – shutting down all non-essential government services and businesses.“The order is to make sure we flatten the curve as soon as possible, and that means getting supplies to our most vulnerable residents and shelters so people stay home, and stay safe,” said tribal council delegate Amber Kanazbah Crotty. “Water is now our number one priority.”The limited access to clean, running water made following coronavirus prevention guidelines such as frequent hand-washing challenging. Now, many government water distribution points have closed, while others have cut their hours to comply with the stay-at-home order.Finding a reliable bulk water supplier is a priority for Branch’s group as local stores and distributors expect shortages over coming weeks.The Navajo women driving this grassroots relief effort bring a range of business, public service and organizing experience, and include the owner of a home care company, a director of a not-for-profit small business incubator, and head of the department of corrections.These skills and contacts enabled them to make deals with wholesalers, and set up distribution points where volunteers sanitize items before trucking them to households in far-flung communities like Tuba City, Black Mesa and Hopi. The baskets are left on the doorstep, to minimize unnecessary physical contact.So far, 214 Covid-19 cases including seven deaths had been confirmed on the Nation.“It warms the heart,” said longstanding tribal council delegate Daniel Tso. “It brings tears to my eyes to see people organizing and risking their own health to protect the elderly and vulnerable children, it really shows the strength of the Navajo people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53695156c6c5d9c0f1a53ec0f4a7dd6477965736/0_14_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8daebe74ac16742320209809f2e4581","title":"air canada flight attendant exposed to covid 19","story":"Gabrielle Wilson of Air Canada started feeling ill after flying back from Frankfurt. After a positive test and quarantine she is left with anxiety and guilt for infecting her familyGabrielle Wilson was enjoying a walk with her children on a brisk spring afternoon, when she was overcome by an overwhelming feeling of weakness.“It hit me like a ton of bricks. I had to sit down on the sidewalk,” said the veteran flight attendant. Throbbing muscle pains cascaded through her body, accompanied by an “eerie dry throat” that she had never before experienced.Wilson, who works for Air Canada and asked to use a pseudonym, had recently completed a return flight from Toronto to Frankfurt and back. Accustomed to occasional discomforts caused by her job, she waved off the symptoms.“I’m not really a hypochondriac. I didn’t honestly think, ‘Oh my God, I’ve got the coronavirus’ or anything.”That evening, however, a fever had set in, and her chest became tight, as if “someone was yanking an elastic from either end” of her lungs.By the next morning, with her body weak and racked by chills, Wilson’s calmness had given way to full-blown panic.Within days, she was quarantined in the basement, but her family also began showing symptoms, prompting the grim realization that she had probably infected her loved ones with Covid-19.Wilson’s experience highlights what many in her profession increasingly view as dangerous work, as the virus passes between travelers and flight crews enclosed for hours on long-haul flights.And as borders close and governments advise their citizens to return home, Wilson fears that infected crew members – some of whom will remain asymptomatic – have become “super spreaders” of the coronavirus, potentially infecting many more.When Wilson first realized something was wrong, she resisted a visit to the hospital – worried she might be adding an unnecessary burden on to Canada’s healthcare system which was already feeling the strain of the first wave of Covid-19 victims.But she relented after speaking with a pulmonologist, and was tested for the coronavirus at a Toronto hospital. Doctors told her to return home and to remain in self-isolation as she waited for the results.“I had sleepless nights, which didn’t help me as I tried to get over the illness. I thought about my family, but could only ever see them through FaceTime,” she said. Her only real-world interaction with them was the meals delivered to the top step of the basement stairs.After six days the test came through positive, but by then, Wilson had learned she wasn’t the only one from her flight to be infected.Seven other Air Canada staff members – two deadheading pilots and five flight attendants – had tested positive for Covid-19 following the return trip to Germany.The crew had been flying a Boeing 777-300, the company’s largest plane. Depending on configuration, it can hold as many as 450 passengers.“We call it a high-density aircraft,” she said. “Ironic, I know.”The two pilots who tested positive had been sitting in business class. Wilson had been working in the back of the plane, on the opposite side of the aircraft.“It led me to believe that there were many people who were Covid-19 positive on that flight,” she said.Meanwhile, Wilson’s family also began developing symptoms – fevers, breathing difficulties and body pains.As she battled a fever and aching body, she was also overwhelmed by guilt – believing if she had acted sooner, recognizing the symptoms as the coronavirus – she could have spared her two daughters and husband.While the family’s symptoms are mild compared with thousands of cases that require hospitalization and intubation, the virus nonetheless also took an immense mental toll.“I only was trying to consume minimal media about coronavirus, because we’re all living it. But the uncertainty just eats away at your mental health,” she said. “For days, I couldn’t fall asleep. For hours on end, I was shaking and my mind was racing. It’s been tough.”In recent days, as more flight attendants and their families test positive for Covid-19, Air Canada has dramatically stepped up precautions on flights. In-flight service has been curtailed to minimize interactions with passengers. Flight crew have access to N95 masks and surgical-level gloves.The company also screens passengers for any sign they might have the virus – and will deny boarding to anyone displaying symptoms.Unions representing flight attendants say the moves are not enough, and say face shields and gowns are also needed. At least 14 flight attendants in Canada have tested positive for the virus and hundreds are in quarantine after suspected exposure.Wilson, who has been temporarily laid off alongside 16,000 other Air Canada employees, is skeptical of policies meant to prevent the further spread of Covid-19.“If I was flying with my symptoms, I would not have triggered any alarm bells. If you’re not heading to ICU or needing a respirator, you can totally get by with not showing any symptoms,” she said. “The headaches, the fever – they all went away with Tylenol and ibuprofen.”Wilson doesn’t believe – given what was known at the time – that her infection could have been avoided.She had worn gloves, washed her hands and minimized contact with travelers.But as new research reveals the efficiency with which the virus can establish infection, such precautions may not always be enough.“We got it from passengers. That’s a fact,” she said. “But now, we’re a part of the spread. We’re the super spreaders, as people frantically fly home.”The one upside of her family testing positive was that Wilson was able to leave the basement – if only to enter quarantine with her husband and daughters. Now, they are slowly recovering, but the anxiety seems likely to leave a lasting mark.“Whenever we all start to feel better, I read a story about someone dying and I get anxious again. I’m just freaking out,” she said. “There’s this overwhelming uncertainty over how it’s going to going affect the next person you know – how it might impact my sister or my brother or my mother. It’s absolutely heart-wrenching.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aaf963f92bc130e5b4d767d860dcaba3b2375bde/0_368_4220_2532/master/4220.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=628afdd8161e50da036f782dc303d43d","title":"asian countries face possible second wave of coronavirus infections","story":"Daily numbers of confirmed cases rising again as people rush home to beat border closuresAsian countries that started to feel tentative hope that their responses to the coronavirus pandemic were bearing fruit are now facing possible second waves, brought by a rush of panicked people racing home to beat border closures and quarantine orders.As daily numbers of confirmed cases start to rise again, and new evidence of asymptomatic cases spark fear of unwitting community transmission, many have now brought in far stricter measures.Jason Kindrachuk, assistant professor and Canada research chair at Manitoba University’s department of medical microbiology \u0026amp infectious diseases, said it was hard to know how daily life could return to normal until there was a vaccine and until governments know what the immunity levels are across the population.“The concern with this virus … is how to reduce social distancing measures and enforcement in such a way that you don’t reignite transmission chains for the virus and find yourself back at square one with trying to get things contained,” he said.One of the first affected by the virus, Hong Kong had already closed schools and some buildings and parks but never enacted a full lockdown.It has now banned foreign arrivals, closed venues and restricted gatherings, strengthened testing, opened quarantine centres, and handed out jail sentences for non-compliance. Tracking bracelets ensure people mandatorily isolating don’t leave their homes.Prof Ben Cowling, an epidemiologist at Hong Kong University’s school of public health, said that while Hong Kong could claim to have prevented an epidemic so far, there was still a risk of one with incoming travellers.Hong Kong never saw more than 11 cases confirmed in a day during the early stages of the outbreak. After thousands of people flew home the number is now regularly above 50, and the city’s health system is strained.Taiwan’s response to the pandemic is considered one of the world’s most successful. It maintains a ban on foreign entrants, and with its infection rate still low – around 330 cases – is more focused on a spat with the World Health Organization.Singapore has introduced fines and jail terms for breaching stay-at-home orders, banned all international short-term visitors and transits, cancelled mass gatherings, and closed venues, places of worship and tuition centres.This week it announced all long term pass-holders needed approval before entering the country, and cancelled the passport of a citizen who flouted stay-at-home orders.Japan’s daily case reports grew slowly over January and February, not reaching more than 50 until last month. While it has held off a major outbreak, Tokyo has become a concern, reporting record high case numbers for four consecutive days in late March.The country’s social distancing and lockdown measures appear far more lax than its neighbours and there has been accusations of under-testing and speculation the number of infected people is far higher than reported.South Korea was once one of the worst outbreak sites, but after implementing aggressive contact tracing, quarantining and isolation, it appeared to get control. Amid fears of a second wave, however, some health experts are calling for the country to extend its entry ban, currently one of the most lax in the region.In mainland China the initial outbreak, which killed thousands, has slowed but there remains concern over people who returned home from abroad and foreigners, all of whom have been banned from entering, including those with residency visas. Restrictions have been lifted in Hubei but across the country people’s movements are policed by a colour-coded health app.This week authorities imposed lockdown on a Chinese county of 600,000 after a woman is thought to have contracted the virus from asymptomatic doctors at a hospital.A study in the Lancet Public Health Journal said the extreme restrictions on Wuhan helped control the outbreak, and lifting them now could see a second wave by August.China’s national health commission said that as of Tuesday, 20,000 people were under observation as possible silent carriers, and the president, Xi Jinping, on a visit to Zhejiang, called for more focus on asymptomatic cases."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57632cf62fb6f40e899d0d0bad7dde6845711fef/0_143_6000_3600/master/6000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f535dfa1cec10e6fd8440a34bb555f97","title":"brighton photographer charts life under coronavirus lockdown","story":"JJ Waller captures people behind closed doors to document hope and fear in face of crisisFaces behind frosted-glass doors and bare windowpanes embodying endurance under the coronavirus siege have been captured by a photographer taking images of people living in lockdown.JJ Waller is taking pictures of residents in Brighton, which was one of the first places in Britain to experience an outbreak of Covid-19.He is roaming the south coast city’s near-deserted streets photographing iniduals and families marooned at home as the nation experiences another week of quarantine.His subjects include a woman holding her newborn baby against the pane of her door, a crouching couple peering out from the front of their house, and an entire family posing in the colours of a local non-league football team.Waller said he was using the daily personal exercise time allowed by the government to record how fellow citizens were coping with life behind closed doors.“Since the lockdown started to kick in three weeks ago I have had 24 different invites to homes across Brighton. They saw a post I put up across social media about this project and all are very happy to take part,” he said.Waller, who is more familiar with taking portraits of comedians such as Eddie Izzard and Paul Merton, said he has been honoured to be invited to come up to the houses, flats and apartments of those taking part. Before becoming a photographer more than 20 years ago, Waller was part of the alternative standup comedy scene.“Technically it is a real challenge because I only get maybe a few minutes to shoot iniduals and families who come to the windows or doors. But I am also honoured that I have their trust to do this,” said Waller.He has detected both fear and hope in the people he has photographed during Brighton’s lockdown.People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.“Some of the pictures have an ominous atmosphere about them and you can see the fear in some of their faces. There are a few people who look very debilitated and weak, possibly from the virus itself.“Yet there is one image from all those I have taken so far that fills me with optimism. It was shot last week at a housing estate up in the Hangleton area an image of a family at the window and in particular a little girl. There was something in the way the child pressed her palm up against the glass that grabbed my eye and made me feel upbeat again.”Fay Bridgewater, who was one of those photographed in the first week of the project, said it was important to take part. “When JJ approached me I was really keen because it was vital to have this moment in time documented for history.“I am smiling in the picture behind our yellow door with my kids and my husband. This was before the death toll started to mount and things were getting really grim. Now I turn off the radio and TV and just hope that one day soon we can get back to normal. I even look forward to the beach being full again of out-of-town tourists,” she said.Waller, preparing to head out for another hour of exercise and photography, said the most striking thing about recording people under siege was the kindness and understanding they had shown him.“One family knew that I am a follower of the ‘other Brighton team’ – Whitehawk FC. So when I turned up at their window last week they were decked out in the colours of the club which I made a photographic album for, documenting their season a couple of years ago. It was a really sweet thing to do. Amid all the doom and gloom, pictures like that give me hope. In many of the photographs there is a twinkle in people’s eyes that says they are not giving up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d7bcd1024d2622ecec5c8b9478d449aef15e777/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b43bc4a4db47b06bb71fb7b286eff2f4","title":"clinicians revised ppe guidance inadequate supplies","story":"Updated advice says any healthcare worker coming within two metres of suspected case should wear protective equipmentClinicians given the right to demand higher-specification personal protective equipment when dealing with coronavirus have warned that new guidance could count for little unless new supplies are made available. New guidance, issued by the UK government, public health authorities and NHS England after criticism of previous guidelines, states that any clinician working in a hospital, primary care or community care setting within two metres of a suspected or confirmed coronavirus Covid-19 patient should wear an apron, gloves, surgical mask and eye protection “based on the risk”.It was updated after fears that the existing rules were confusing and some healthcare professionals were not being adequately protected from the risk of contracting the virus and passing it on to others.Employers and unions broadly welcomed the new guidance, issued on Thursday, which doubles the distance at which PPE is required, but warned that it must be backed by adequate supplies.Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of council at the British Medical Association (BMA), said the doctors’ union had heard concerns from physicians in more than 30 hospital trusts about shortages. “What fundamentally matters is that doctors and healthcare workers get the adequate and appropriate supplies of PPE on the frontline,” he said. “Without these supplies, there is continued unacceptable danger to the health and lives of healthcare workers and their patients.”Doctors’ Association UK agreed that adequate supplies were key and said the requirement for long-sleeve protective gowns should have been extended in place of “flimsy plastic aprons”.Reports have been rife of shortages and large variations in the level of PPE available. Pictures of healthcare workers who have created their own makeshift protective equipment out of bin bags and other materials have proved embarrassing for the government and NHS leaders. Staff have also improvised masks out of snorkels, bought kit from hardware stores, and used school science goggles to protect themselves.Last week, the president of the Royal College of Surgeons, Prof Derek Alderson, urged members not to risk their health, following widespread reports of shortages. He said the new guidance was an improvement, but so long as shortages remained, “my warning still holds true”.Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the guidance was straightforward for “staff to apply it to the clinical reality they face, whether they work in hospitals or the community. It means that if they think they need protective kit in a particular situation, they should be able to access it and wear it. But guidance is not the whole answer. Staff will need the right training and the right equipment, including for example ‘fit test’ kits to make sure the masks are effective. “There have been real problems with distribution, we have been assured they are being addressed, and to be fair, in many places that is happening. But any remaining supply chain problems need to be dealt with without delay.”Unite, which represents 100,000 NHS staff, said increasing supplies was “a national priority”.The government said the new guidance “reflects the fact that coronavirus is now widespread in the community, meaning clinicians are more likely to see patients with the virus, some of whom may have minimal or no symptoms” and has the support of the World Health Organization (WHO).The previous guidance recommended PPE outside high-risk procedures when healthcare workers were within one metre of a patients with suspected or confirmed Covid-19. The new guidelines makes them consistent with the two-metre social distancing rule.Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said: “NHS England and the government are working hard to secure the supply lines in this challenging period so staff have the appropriate equipment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7549248a2306f4ee213d8e57bf198e5038535a47/0_23_4076_2445/master/4076..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96c7499d68d1727030adf13124dbd90a","title":"coronavirus testing how some countries germany south korea got ahead of the rest","story":"Germany was quick to see the threat while South Korea took an aggressive approachCountries have approached coronavirus testing in different ways, and in some places there was far earlier recognition than in the UK of the need to develop tests and kits and to have sufficient numbers stockpiled. Here is how some countries got ahead of the curve.With its experience of Sars at the start of the century and as the apparent source of origin of Covid-19, it is perhaps unsurprising that China is ahead of others on testing. By the end of March it had conducted well over 320,000 tests.One of the earliest tests was developed in mainland China by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, and details of it were posted on the World Health Organization website on 24 January, just after the Wuhan lockdown was announced.A Hong Kong team that helped identify Sars worked to develop its own test. “Because we have gone through all these events in the past, we know how important it is to have a working diagnostic test,” said Leo Poon, who led the team. “That’s why we basically tried to get the work done as soon as possible.”As one of the world’s major chemicals producers, China was able to quickly accelerate production of kits.Germany’s preparedness was helped in part by a recognition that coronavirus was likely to become a global problem. While most countries were slow in dusting off pandemic preparedness plans, in early January a scientist in Berlin, Olfert Landt, recognised the similarity to Sars and realised a test kit would be needed.Lacking a gene sequence for the new coronavirus, Landt and his company designed their first test kit based on Sars and other known coronaviruses. The protocol was published by the WHO on 17 January, before the Chinese test. The British government passed on this test. By the end of February Landt had produced 4m kits and was making another 1.5m a week.As well as having an effective test in mass production, Germany signed up politically to mass testing from the beginning, resulting in it being able to do 12,000 tests daily.South Korea has been among the most aggressive when it comes to testing. In contrast with the early stages in the UK – where Boris Johnson said coronavirus was likely to “spread a bit more” – South Korean health officials quickly learned the lessons from Wuhan that the new virus was extremely contagious and could spread rapidly over a wide area.The country prioritised identifying and isolating people testing positive for the disease, and developed capacity to run about 15,000 diagnostic tests a day. It has conducted more than 300,000 tests to date, free of charge, including in drive-through testing booths since replicated elsewhere.Small and relatively wealthy, the country has a few advantages when it comes to testing, and it has tested a higher proportion of its citizens than anywhere else in the world, including many showing no symptoms of the disease.“Iceland’s population puts it in the unique position of having very high testing capabilities with help from the Icelandic medical research company deCode Genetics,” Thorolfur Guðnason, Iceland’s chief epidemiologist, told BuzzFeed. He said the testing effort was “intended to gather insight into the actual prevalence of the virus in the community, as most countries are most exclusively testing symptomatic iniduals at this time.”After Germany, Italy has done the most testing, with about 200,000 tests. These included all 3,000 residents of the town of Vò, near Venice, in a pilot project designed to see if whole-community testing could help slow the spread of the disease.Italy showed how widespread testing could be as politically contentious as insufficient testing, with some including the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, initially appearing to blame the country’s high number of infections on the policy of testing people without symptoms. “We have been the first ones with the most rigorous and accurate controls,” Conte said on TV, adding that Italy appeared to have more people infected because “we did more tests”. As it turned out, the tests were an accurate warning of what was coming."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69515f35b15605b8df59c84c8296b8acc7cb2846/0_85_4000_2401/master/4000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f968562bfadc9e6e0be32d49b8054bc","title":"coronavirus took hold in uk earlier than thought data reveals","story":"Earliest death occurred on 28 February, almost a week before previously acknowledgedThe coronavirus outbreak took hold earlier in the UK and has claimed dozens more lives than previously thought, new data in England and Scotland has revealed.Amid growing concern over the shifting picture of the outbreak presented by changes to the daily figures, NHS England said the earliest death occurred on 28 February, almost a week before previously acknowledged.Health trusts in England disclosed that six people had died in hospitals from Covid-19 as early as February – with the first death previously made public on5 March. The news came as the UK endured its most deadly day of the coronavirus pandemic, in which 569 fatalities were recorded.The UK-wide figures showed that by 5pm on Wednesday a total of 2,921 people had died, following a slightly larger increase than the previous day, when there were 563 deaths.By 9am on Thursday, 163,194 people had been tested for the virus across the UK, with 33,718 positive cases, representing a rise of 4,244 from the previous day. In all, 12,949 people have so far been hospitalised with symptoms.The figures for deaths reveal a moving picture, with totals beset by inconsistencies and the overall number of deaths reported on any given day significantly higher than those from the preceding 24 hours. On Thursday, 561 deaths were reported, but only 84 took place in the 24 hours to 5pm on 1 April. Earlier this week the number of deaths reported on one day was less than half the total number of deaths that occurred in the reporting period the day before. On 30 March, 159 deaths were reported by NHS England. The true number of deaths on that day has since been revised up to 401.Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia specialising in infectious diseases, said the data suggested the UK was about two weeks behind Italy. “Yesterday was a huge jump on the previous day, which itself was a pretty big rise from the day before. This rise is slightly more than yesterday but essentially on par,” he said.The devolved government later released revised data for the week after using new methodology that included laboratory data. Until today, Covid-19 deaths in that set were not counted until next of kin had given permission for them to be recorded.The updated figures showed that Scottish fatality rates began increasing much more steeply than thought on 31 March. Using the old system, the official death toll stood at 86 on Thursday the new methodology put Thursday’s total at 126.Catherine Calderwood, Scotland’s chief medical officer, said every death meant there were roughly 1,000 coronavirus infections in the general population, implying that 40,000 more Scots may have been infected.Sturgeon said there had been delays in obtaining relatives’ consent before some deaths were recorded centrally. Health Protection Scotland, a government agency, confirmed later that “new, more efficient” reporting procedures had now been introduced which did not need family consent.“Part of the cruelty of this virus is that when people are in hospital and when they’re dying, family members are not able to be with them,” Sturgeon said. “Therefore it has taken a bit longer for families to be informed and for them to give their consent to all the things that are required.”Opposition parties censured the Scottish government over the misreporting. Labour said it echoed concerns from GPs and families that deaths outside hospitals and “presumed deaths” were not being properly recorded and being missed.Monica Lennon, Scottish Labour’s health spokesman, said: “Irrespective of where people have died, be it in their own house, a nursing home or a hospital, we need the full facts about this virus. It’s clear that a lack of testing is contributing to the lack of information, which is unacceptable.”Additonal reporting: Niamh McIntyre and Pamela Duncan"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk map how many cases in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities map the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

Four people have died on the Zaandam and dozens are sick with flu-like symptoms on the vessels.Ahead of the decision to allow the boats to dock, Holland America Line said guests that met US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention health guidelines would be transported home immediately once on land, largely on charter flights. About 10 guests will require immediate critical care once docked and 45 guests with mild illness will be required to stay onboard with the crew until they have recovered.The Zaandam cruise liner last entered port in Valparaíso, Chile, more than two weeks ago and has been stranded at sea with a Covid-19 outbreak onboard worsening after several Latin American countries refused to let it dock.Asymptomatic passengers were transferred to the Rotterdam, its sister ship, off the coast of Panama in a boat-to-boat rescue operation.“Both Zaandam and the Rotterdam have just received clearance for both ships to proceed into Port Everglades,” the captain of the Rotterdam announced to passengers on Thursday afternoon.“I am very happy to share this good news with you. It has been a long journey. Your journey home is ready to begin and we will give you an update on the next steps.”The agreement to let both ships dock in Florida comes after opposition from the state governor Ron DeSantis and several Broward County commissioners who feared that they could not cope with an influx of sick passengers.But after intervention by President Trump earlier this week, the cruise liners have been allowed into port after officials approved a plan from the cruise operators.“It’s a go, everything is signed” said Broward County commissioner Barbara Sharief, who said the plan was briefly held up by the need to get agreements from the company on how they would take responsibility for any additional patients that need hospitalisation. “I’m happy. These people need to get off this ship and go home. I’m glad we could help them.”But Trantalis noted that more cruise ships loaded with passengers are waiting to come into Ft. Lauderdale in the next few days – including another ship owned by a Carnival Cruises subsidiary, the Coral Princess. That ship was turned away from Brazil and other South American ports nearly two weeks ago. The company announced on Tuesday that that ship also has passengers with influenza symptoms.“Of course, it’s a concern,” said Trantalis, who originally opposed allowing the Zaandam to come into Ft Lauderdale. “We have no information about the conditions of the passengers on the Coral Princess just yet. But we will use our influence with the county to make sure that any ill passengers are properly isolated and quarantined.”Meanwhile, a financial filing by the Carnival Corporation on Wednesday said there were still 6000 cruise ship passengers stuck at sea on Carnival-owned cruise ships alone.“They are not the last ship, said Trantalis. “I understand there are more ships out there behind them … So it’s a continuing dilemma.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf1984dce1e86d9d6ba2113b49e94f0e70aaec0a/0_125_2603_1562/master/2603..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb8cfeb39b7f4a38d348454a249d6af5","title":"germany told it needs to massively increase coronavirus testing","story":"Country seen as a model for its response is told it is not doing nearly enoughGermany still needs to increase its coronavirus testing rate dramatically if it wants to successfully manage the virus, scientists are advising the government.As the British government has struggled to tackle a testing shortfall, Germany has been repeatedly named as an example to follow in recent days, but a confidential scientific study commissioned by the government and recently leaked to German media showed that if it wanted to avoid a mass outbreak of the coronavirus, the country would have to greatly increase its testing capacity.Ever since the government’s introduction of a strict lockdown, including closing the country’s borders and shutting down schools and nurseries, the scientists said around a million people in Germany – which has a population of just under 83 million – were likely to become infected, and around 12,000 would die. That outlook, however, was based on an increase in testing to 100,000 a day and within weeks to 200,000 a day.The study’s authors said that in order to carry out testing in the most efficient and quickest way possible, it would also be necessary in the longer term to rely on the use of big data and location tracking via mobile phones, an issue that is controversial in Germany.Lothar Wieler, the head of the government’s main public health advisory body, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), said that while German testing was high compared with other countries, it would have to be speeded up. “We need to increase efficiency,” he said, adding that he welcomed the news that the use of quicker and simpler tests, in addition to the current standard PCR – polymerase chain reaction test, which directly detects the DNA or RNA of the pathogen – would soon be available.Germany has a large network of more than 85 laboratories and a good history of detecting illness early. A nationwide network set up between doctors’ practices, normally used to monitor the flu, was also used for testing for Covid-19 from February onwards, and the fact the system only detected a case on 12 March indicates that the virus was not widespread before then..“The fact is that Germany started testing early on and has tested broadly. That way, many cases but also milder cases have been detected, and they did not generally include the elderly,” Wieler said.It has, he said, in effect distorted the figures. He warns that the situation in Germany is likely to worsen, as many more of the elderly who have so far not been so affected, are likely to get sick. “We are still at the start of the epidemic, and it is completely unclear as to how it will develop,” Wieler said. “But of course the number of deaths in Germany will rise.”He has insisted there is not, as has sometimes been suspected, an “under-reporting” of deaths from Covid-19 by hospitals. It would in theory be possible that some deaths were not counted as deaths from coronavirus, if the patient had an underlying health condition. But that is seldom likely to be the case, due to the sensibility towards the illness right now. Only if someone with coronavirus was killed by something unrelated to the virus, such as a car crash, would they not be included, medical authorities say.Testing laboratories across Germany report that while they have been at pains to increase their capacity, they face many obstacles. Germany’s federal system has contributed to an inefficient gathering of data – including an unclear picture of how much testing has been done – and delays in testing suspected cases, delivering results or informing contact people. Germany’s regional health bodies have recruited extra staff to help deal with the backlog, but say they are struggling to keep up. The RKI has recruited scouts – often medical students and trained doctors who arrived as refugees but are waiting to have their qualifications recognised – to support the system.Accredited Laboratories in Medicine (ALM), the largest association representing laboratories in Germany working on the tests, has said that testing capacity has increased significantly since the first case emerged in the country at the end of January.“We’re working around the clock, in a shift system, including at weekends,” Evangelos Kotsopoulos, head of ALM told Die Zeit newspaper. “Our main bottlenecks are staff – many of whom have young children and are affected by school and nursery closures – and supplies from industry. Around the world there are only five or six big suppliers for the materials that we need.”Kotsopoulos said Germany should be far more focused on who it tested, to ensure those “who don’t have symptoms but just want to know whether they have it or not” are not tested, in favour of those such as at-risk patients for whom it is considered a necessity. “It is simply not practically possible right now to test everyone in a population of our size,” he said.According to the RKI’s guideline, priority should be given to testing medical workers, people with underlying health conditions showing coronavirus symptoms and those in contact with those who are infected, so as to be able to place them under quarantine.But many working on the testing frontline report concerns about a lack of materials and inefficiency, as well as a shortage of staff, forcing many people to work seven-day weeks.“The reagents we need are produced by just three manufacturers in Germany and they have run dry,” Elisabeth Koerber-Kröll from the district medical faculty in Schwäbisch Hall, in Baden-Württemberg, south-west Germany, one of the hardest hit regions told broadcaster SWR.Increasing emphasis is also being put on antibody tests, as well as antigen tests, as a more efficient way of managing the spread of the virus, in addition to self-testing, although many are sceptical that that this is reliable enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21bfdf5c0595dc629e1e15a5cb334af1c46225b4/0_90_3044_1827/master/3044..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10628c3eddd02e34479408557cfd253b","title":"matt hancock sets target of 100000 coronavirus tests a day","story":"Health secretary ‘determined’ to reach six-figure goal for England by end of AprilThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, has set the government a new target of carrying out 100,000 Covid-19 tests a day in England by the end of April as he sought to defend the government’s approach.After several days of intense scrutiny over failures in testing, including the prioritisation of the public over doctors and nurses, Hancock said he was setting out a new “five-pillar” strategy.He said England would hit 100,000 tests a day, which would include antigen tests that show whether people are currently suffering from Covid-19, as well as antibody tests to see whether people have had the infection and recovered.Speaking at the end of his seven days of quarantine after testing positive for the virus, he said: “I’m now setting the goal of 100,000 tests per day by the end of this month. That is the goal and I’m determined we’ll get there.”On Tuesday, there was capacity for 12,799 daily tests in England, although just over 10,650 people were tested. The government’s target by mid-April had been to test 25,000 a day.Hancock said it was his decision to prioritise testing of patients over NHS staff, and added that he thought any health secretary would have done the same.“I understand why NHS staff want tests, so they can get back to the frontline, of course I do,” he said. “But I took the decision that the first priority has to be the patients for whom the results of a test could be the difference in treatment that is the difference between life and death.“I believe anybody in my shoes would have taken the same decision.”His announcement came at the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing, where he announced that more than £13bn of historical debt owed by hospital trusts would be written off to place the National Health Service in a “stronger position” to respond to the crisis.The health secretary said he had also made £300m available for community pharmacies and that he wanted to make sure “every part” of the health and care system was supported.“Today, to help NHS trusts to deliver what’s needed without worrying about past finances, I can announce that I’m writing off £13.4bn of historic NHS debt,” he said.“This landmark step will not only put the NHS in a stronger position to be able to respond to this global coronavirus pandemic, but it will ensure that our NHS has stronger foundations for the future too.”In an unusually detailed press conference following several days of criticism of the government’s strategy, Hancock also attempted to confront claims that the UK is lagging behind the responses to the disease in other European countries such as Germany.Hancock said he was going to “level with you” on the challenges the UK faced and the government’s plan to increase testing significantly.The UK had not gone into this crisis with a huge diagnostics industry, as Germany had, he said, and so had been “catching up”.People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.Demand for materials had led to a shortage of both swabs and reagents, Hancock said. The swabs issue has been fixed but “we are still tackling the reagents issue, which is a global challenge”, he said.In what appeared to be a first acknowledgement from the government that mistakes had been made, he added: “There will be criticisms made, and some of them will be justified.”Hancock said there was a “challenge” in ensuring the public could have confidence in the tests being used on NHS staff. He added that a number of testing methods being analysed had failed to positively diagnose a coronavirus patient.“In one case a test that I’m being urged to buy missed three out of four positive cases for coronavirus.“That means that three-quarters of cases, that test would have given the false comfort of sending someone with coronavirus back on the wards. Approving tests that don’t work is dangerous and I will not do it,” he said.Hancock paid an emotional tribute to NHS staff who had lost their lives, and expressed his “deepest condolences” to the friends and families of all coronavirus victims.“If the past few weeks have shown us anything, it’s that we are steadfast as a country in our resolve to defeat this invisible killer,” he said.He went on to acknowledge that most of the NHS staff who had died had been migrants to the UK.“I am profoundly moved by the compassion and the commitment that we are seeing from people right across the country, and in the health and care system we have lost colleagues too.“Many of those who have died who are from the NHS were people who came to this country to make a difference, and they did, and they’ve given their lives in sacrifice, and we salute them,” he said.Hancock said he had come back from self-isolation on Thursday “redoubled in my determination to fight this virus with everything I’ve got”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73e40051d6a4a0260f2ecf2c20e0bd20f7868899/0_100_5481_3288/master/5481..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec4be864d580943fafeb3d9b2e0b657e","title":"words i thought id never write thank god for matt hancock","story":"The health secretary wrote off £13bn of NHS debt, promised 100,000 tests and acted like a grownupFor much of the week, it’s been as if the government has gone out of its way to appear wilfully clueless. First, the psychotically unstable Dominic Raab, then the pathologically untrustworthy Michael Gove, culminating with the shambolically underprepared Alok Sharma. History repeating itself first as tragedy, then as farce. It was as if the only real contingency plans the government had made were for the postponement of this year’s climate change conference. Sometimes, doing absolutely nothing proves to be entirely the right option.But cometh the hour... There are some words I thought I’d never write. Like “Thank God for Matt Hancock”. But thank God for Matt Hancock. It seemed a high-risk strategy to send out the health secretary for the daily Downing Street press conference as it was only six days since he announced that he had contracted the coronavirus. And the official NHS guidelines is for anyone with symptoms to self-isolate for a week.Maybe he had first become symptomatic shortly after 5pm last Thursday. That at least would explain why the press conference began 25 minutes late. Matt was merely doing his civic duty. He had been waiting the full seven days and had just sneaked into Downing Street under the wire.This was Hancock at his least needy. Though Matt being Matt, he couldn’t not let slip a slight air of Tiggerishness at the start of his statement. A Tigger’s gotta do what a Tigger’s gotta do. The government had been doing a brilliant job. Everything that was being done was being guided by the science: even if the science the UK government had occasionally seemed out of step with that of countries with rather better track records on treating the disease.He was also positively gushing about the speed at which the 4,000-bed Nightingale hospital had been knocked together in London. In fairness it’s one hell of an achievement. But by no stretch of the imagination can it be called a proper hospital. It’s a field hospital at best. Let’s hope Boris Johnson doesn’t think he can get away with counting it as one of his promised 40 new hospitals. When push comes to shove it’s just a much-needed large facility, providing basic care for people with respiratory problems caused by the coronavirus. It would be no one’s destination of choice for urgent treatment.But then Tigger dropped the Tigger act. Rishi Sunak apart, for the first time since the pandemic started, a minister stood up to take responsibility for the situation. It’s a weird coincidence that the two ministers who look as if they still need to show ID at off-licences are the ones to show true leadership. Sure he looked a bit defensive at times, but given the circumstances that seemed fair enough. He was boldly going where no minister had gone before.Even though he didn’t go into details – such as why the South Koreans and the Germans are able to identify tests that work while we appear to have bought 7.5m kits that we still have no idea if they are effective or not – he did admit the government had made mistakes. And now that he was recovering from the illness, he was going to take personal responsibility for putting things right.First he was going to write off £13bn of NHS debt. On any other day this would have been the biggest news story – one that would have horrified most of his fellow Tory MPs – but now it was nothing more than a throwaway aside. An academic footnote. He quickly moved on. “I have a five-pillar plan,” he declared. Politicians love to have plans in fives. Four sounds too few and six sounds as if you aren’t thinking clearly. Matt, though, had just one pillar. To fend off ongoing criticism of the government’s testing programme by committing to 100,000 tests per day by the end of the month.Given that the government has consistently missed even its own piss-poor targets – we’re struggling to manage 10,000 tests per day at the moment – it was understandable that most of the questions were on whether 100,000 was hopelessly optimistic. But Matt was adamant. He couldn’t exactly promise how many of the tests would be antibody and and how many antigen, but 100,000 was the hill he was prepared to die on. No more bullshit. No more obfuscation. A real target with his job on the line if he failed to deliver.To add to the distinct air of the surreal – it’s so rare to find a politician behaving like a grownup – he even allowed journalists follow-up questions. Normally the minister fails to answer the question he or she has been asked and swiftly moves on to the next one. But now Matt was positively inviting interrogation. Had he been clear enough? Do you want more details? Most of the hacks were so startled by this new openness they didn’t actually have any prepared follow-ups and ad-libbed. For once it was the media doing the waffling.For reasons best known to itself, the BBC got bored of such an informative press conference and cut to the weather forecast halfway through. Apparently it’s going to be a nice weekend in which to stay indoors. But Sky persevered to the end and Matt extended the press conference to a record-beating 80 minutes. In more ways than one, he had raised the bar considerably for other ministers in the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3cfbda2a7a0fcb476054adbb4d9c2af05872ec/0_5_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8e47c6f0eb4865ff1b3d69ff20dcaac","title":"how are you affected by coronavirus in the south west of the uk","story":"If you live in the south-west England or Wales, we’d like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.

Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh, say they could give people a “sense of false security”.It’s not something that we’ve ever done before. When we vaccinate people, particularly for certain diseases where they’re going to travel overseas ... we give people a certificate saying they have been vaccinated.But that certificate doesn’t say they are immune and there’s a difference. We don’t know yet whether somebody who has had this virus is immune.They have antibodies, they’ve clearly been exposed, yet will those antibodies protect them against reinfection? I’m not sure that we know that.So to give a certificate saying somebody is immune, I think is actually quite dangerous because: A, we don’t know if it’s true and B, it could give people a slight sense of false security, where they start to do things that they wouldn’t otherwise do.For the general public, saying you’re immune they will think ‘oh, OK, I don’t need to worry anymore’ – and there will be people who will die as a result of that. I think it’s very risky and I don’t think it’s necessary.“A glimmer of hope but little detail.” See the experts’ reaction to the UK health secretary Matt Hancock’s new testing plan:The US president Donald Trump has invoked the Defense Production Act to aid companies building ventilators for coronavirus patients to receive the supply of materials they need.In a memo released by the White House, Trump directed the US health and human services secretary to use his authority to help facilitate the supply of ventilator materials for six companies – General Electric Co, Hill-Rom Holdings Inc and Medtronic Plc, as well as Resmed Inc, Royal Philips N.V. and Vyaire Medical Inc.France will probably extend the coronavirus confinement beyond 15 April, the country’s prime minister Édouard Philippe has said. France went into lockdown on 17 March and a first two-week period has already been extended to 15 April. Philippe told TF1:I can understand the impatience, but deconfinement is not for tomorrow morning.Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, is continuing to play down the pandemic, saying it is “not all it’s being made out to be” and denying that any hospital in the country has reached its full capacity due to the outbreak.Here’s a summary of the latest events:You can see a summary of earlier events here.At least one million people around the world have been infected since the outbreak began, according to figures collected by researchers from Johns Hopkins University.The true extent of the pandemic is likely to be significantly greater because some countries are suspected of underreporting their figures and a lack of testing facilities in others. The institution’s data are based on official releases, as well as media reports and other sources.The USA has seen by far the most cases, with at least 234,462, while Italy and Spain have also passed the 100,000 threshold. Next is Germany, which has reported at least 84,264 cases, and then China, where the outbreak began, which researchers say has seen at least 82,432 cases.Researchers say at least 1,002,159 people have now been infected.Staying in the UK, the opposition Labour party has been responding to the health secretary’s new target of carrying out 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, has said:A commitment to 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month is welcome, but NHS staff will recall that only a few weeks ago Boris Johnson was promising 250,000 a day.We look forward to seeing the details of how this commitment will be delivered, especially for NHS and care staff for whom this is now a pressing and urgent priority.It has taken us weeks to get to 10,000 tests today, and we still have no details of what proportion of this 100,000 will be PCR tests or antibody tests.As public health experts have repeatedly highlighted, reintroducing community testing and contact tracing will be vital to end cycles of lockdown and we repeat our calls for a clear national testing strategy.The billionaire retailer, Philip Green, is asking for UK taxpayer help to prop up his crumbling fashion empire, with 14,500 employees set to be paid out of the government’s emergency wage support scheme.Like other fashion retailers, Arcadia, which owns brands including Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge, is facing financial turmoil as the lockdown prevents Britons from shopping. The company has already asked landlords for rent cuts and paused payments into its pension scheme.After the widespread participation in last week’s “clap for carers” event – in which isolated people all over the UK applauded NHS workers from their windows, gardens and balconies – people are planning a repeat for the country’s other key workers in about 10 minutes’ time.The UK is looking at the possibility of issuing immunity certificates to people who have developed resistance to the coronavirus, but there needs to be more research into the science behind it, the country’s health minister, Matt Hancock, has said.It is an important thing that we will be doing and are looking at but it’s too early in the science of the immunity that comes from having had the disease. It’s too early in that science to be able to put clarity around that. I wish that we could but the reason that we can’t is because the science isn’t yet advanced enough.As the pandemic worsens, panicked governments have been accused of using questionable methods to acquire supplies in the battle against the coronavirus. Tactics have ranged from blocking exports of medical supplies to sending spies on clandestine missions to find tests.’s network of correspondents have looked at how fears of shortages are driving many countries to take increasingly devious measures to secure masks and tests.The number of coronavirus deaths in hospitals in France has reached 4,503, an increase of 471 in 24 hours, slightly fewer than in previous days, Kim Willsher reports from Paris. Added to the figure, however, are an estimated 884 deaths in retirement and care homes given for the first time. The head of France’s national health authority, Jérôme Salomon, also said the figures from non-hospital health establishments were only partial.The figures suggest the number of people being admitted to hospital with the coronavirus has dropped slightly and is stabilising, and that the number being taken into intensive care has risen very slightly by 20 extra cases in 24 hours.Numbers of cases of Covid-19 have continued to rise across Africa, even if the continent has yet to see outbreaks comparable to some elsewhere, Jason Burke reports from Johannesburg.African Union member states are now reporting 6,470 cases and 241 deaths, and they say the growth is “close to exponential”.Dr John Nkengasong, the head of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters the virus was an existential threat to African countries and that with local transmission now underway many would pass the 10,000-infection mark by the end of April.Health officials also cautioned, however, against the total lockdowns that increasing numbers of African nations have imposed on tens of millions of people.Don’t lock down the whole country. Lock down cities or communities where there’s extensive community transmission so ... social harm is minimised. But if infection is spreading across the entire country, you have no choice.The World Health Organization called for socially restrictive measures “to be accompanied by strong, sustained and targeted public health measures that locate, isolate, test and treat COVID-19 cases”.As coronavirus lockdowns have been expanded globally, billions of people are faced with unprecedented restrictions. ’s video team has taken a look at some of the extreme strategies governments are using to police their citizens, from teargas and death threats to beatings and bleach.The global total of confirmed deaths from Covid-19 has passed 50,000, according to the tally of official figures maintained by Johns Hopkins University. According to the research university based in the US state of Maryland, which has been running an interactive map tracking the progress of the pandemic, 50,230 people have so far died from Covid-19 since it was first detected in Wuhan, China, in late December.Italy remains the country worst-affected by the outbreak with 13,915 deaths, followed by Spain with 10,003.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPAWestmeath currently has the highest rate of coronavirus cases outside of Dublin, analysis of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre’s data shows.\u0026nbspThis  analysis of the HPSC’s figures is based on the latest breakdown of data by county made available of 2,990 confirmed cases as of midnight, March 30th.\u0026nbspThe analysis shows that the highest rates of coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, are currently in Leinster with Dublin having 122.1 cases per 100,000 population followed by Westmeath (90.1), both of which are much higher than the rest of the country. Calculating the rate per 100,000 population allows for a like by like comparison between counties.The rate is based on confirmed cases only and does not paint the full picture of any particular county with rates likely to be higher in all areas. As of Sunday, 15,000 people were waiting to be tested for Covid-19 and about 1,500 people are being tested per day for the virus.\u0026nbspWhile these rates change on a daily basis, Westmeath has been among the counties with the highest rates over the past number of days and its incidence rate is currently 13 times greater than Carlow, the county with the lowest rate of Covid-19 cases, at 7 cases per 100,000 population.\u0026nbspWhile Cork has the second highest number of cases in the country (255 of 2,990 cases) and a rate of 47 cases per 100,000 population, Tipperary currently has the highest rate in all of Munster at 53.3 cases per 100,000 population.\u0026nbspGalway has the highest rate of cases in Connacht at 34.1 per 100,000 population while Cavan has the highest in Ulster at 47.3 cases per 100,000 population.\u0026nbspOf the 2,990 cases analysed by the HPSC, 48 per cent are male and 50 per cent are female, with 134 clusters involving 563 cases. The median age is 48 years old.\u0026nbspNorthern IrelandPublic Health Agency data published on Wednesday shows there are 689 cases of Covid-19, with 30 deaths across the North’s local government districts. An  analysis of the North’s Public Health Agency data shows that Belfast, has the largest number of cases (200) and the highest rate of Covid-19 infections of all local government authorities in the North at a rate of 58.5 cases per 100,00 population. Belfast’s rate is almost five times that of Causeway and Glens local government district which on Wednesday had a rate of 12.5 confirmed cases per 100,000. It is unknown what districts 39 of the 689 came from. The North and South are taking differnt approches to testing with the Republic\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspfollowing a South Korean model of testing, tracing and isolation to suppress cases whereas the North is not testing as widely.\u0026nbspThe analysis on the State’s figures were carried out using data from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and the figures published on the map of Ireland here, accessed on April 1st.\u0026nbspThe rate was calculated using the CSO’s 2016 population census available here.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4219101.1585847521!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus almost 100 staff and residents in one nursing home test positive d%C3%A1il hears","story":"Fianna Fáil’s spokesman for health Stephen Donnelly said the nursing home has 200 staff, 70 of whom have tested positive for Covid-19.

File photograph: Getty Almost 100 staff members and residents in one nursing home have tested positive for coronavirus, the Dáil has been told.Fianna Fáil’s spokesman for health Stephen Donnelly said the nursing home has 200 staff, 70 of whom have tested positive for Covid-19. He said of the 100 residents, 19 have tested positive and four have died.Furthermore, members of the cleaning staff and kitchen staff are now absent, Mr Donnelly said, adding there were difficulties in securing agency staff.“The situation is very, very serious. The nursing homes can’t get the staff that they need. They can’t get their hands on personal protective equipment either. They are getting very, very small amounts and it is not enough. Now I know the HSE is trying to deploy its own staff to try and plug some of these gaps but much more is needed.”Earlier Minister for Health Simon Harris told the Dáil that addressing issues in long term residential care is “a big public health issue that we have to get right”.“We have some of our oldest and most vulnerable residents living in nursing homes and other residential settings. We need to make sure that the safeguards are in place to protect them but also to ensure that we don’t see the risk of infection spreading from there into the community as well.”Mr Harris said the National Public Health Emergency Team will meet on Friday to discuss issues in relation to long term residential care. Mr Harris updated TDs on efforts to combat the spread of coronavirus.He said the deaths of 85 men and women should give a “singular focus”. Mr Harris said the number of cases will continue to rise but the rate of growth in new measures has slowed. He said that the health service is “making sure we do everything that is humanly possible to prepare our acute hospital system to deal with the increased demand.”“Every country is looking for the same products, the same supplies.”Testing capacityHe acknowledged that testing capacity has been constrained but said Ireland is still testing more than most other countries.“The HSE has indicated it now has sufficient test swabs and more orders will be delivered in the coming days. The HSE has also been making every effort to procure other stock including sourcing domestic production of reagents.” He said the aim was still to test up to 15,000 people a day.Mr Harris also said decision by the Dáil to sit on Tuesday was “risking public health.”“Days we do not lead by example are days that we should regret.”The Minister urged the public to continue abiding by the restrictions put in place by the Government.“The message people need to hear is, you are already making a difference. There is no doubt throughout the countless efforts of so many people, lives have been saved already and we can do more. Let me be really clear, this shouldn’t in any way confuse any of us in relation to what we need to do because there can be no cause for complacency,” he said.He said he believed the country will eventually return to normal but will not get there unscathed.Leader of the Social Democrats Catherine Murphy said she has been contacted by several workers who are questioning why they are deemed essential including workers from a warehouse that provides supply to shops that are no longer open.Financial challengeMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe also told the Dáil that responding to the scale of the financial challenge will not be easy. “Together we face an extraordinary challenge. In these uncertain times given the anxiety and the distress it was crucial that we did all we could to reassure citizens. We may not have got, and we did not get, everything perfect. But much of what we did was good. In doing so we have laid a strong foundation from which to recover from this crisis.” Fianna Fáil’s public expenditure spokesman Barry Cowen said that this crisis “far outweighs the impact of the banking crisis”.Meanwhile Minister for Culture Josepha Madigan reacted with anger to the decision to hold Thursday’s Dáil sitting. “Shame on you,” she said to opposition politicians, “you have forced us to stray from home. There is no reason why we couldn’t have done this remotely.”Independent TD Danny Healy Rae noted that the Taoiseach had thanked the Chinese Government for the supply of PPE equipment but added: “I would thank the Chinese as well if they had kept their virus.”Marian Harkin said she was “annoyed” by the comment made by Mr Healy Rae. “This is not a Chinese virus. Those comments are inappropriate in this house or anywhere else.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4219396.1585851221!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar decision next week on relaxing coronavirus restrictions","story":"Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has warned that the economic picture is “very bad” and that Ireland is facing into a recession.

Photograph: Leon FarrellPhotocall IrelandPA Wire A decision will be made towards the end of next week on whether or not to relax the current restrictions imposed on the public to halt the spread of the coronavirus, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.Mr Varadkar has also warned that the economic picture is “very bad” and that Ireland is facing into a recession.“We are facing a public health emergency which in turn is leading to an economic recession.”He said the economy is “in hibernation” but the Government is working on plans for an economic recovery.Mr Varadkar said the objective is to “avoid another era of austerity.”He also signalled that taxes could be cut to stimulate the economy but that Ireland needs to have the capacity to borrow at rates that are affordable, and the Government will not know if this is possible until the full picture emerges.A Cabinet sub-committee met on Thursday to consider the latest modelling on the spread of coronavirus. While there has been progress in flattening the curve of cases, Mr Varadkar said there was a “slight uptick” in the rate of increase of new cases today but cautioned against reading into one single day.He said that rate of increase must be lowered to five per cent or less in order for the health service to adequately cope.In relation to the Government restrictions on movement and travel, Mr Varadkar said it will be the end of next week before the National Public Health Emergency Team can make any recommendations.Furthermore, the easing of restrictions will also be dependent on the establishment of a robust contact tracing system.The Taoiseach said he was satisfied with the current capacity of the health service to deal with the health emergency.There are 109 patients in intensive care units and there is capacity to ventilate around 1,200 people at any one time.On the issue of childcare for frontline workers, Mr Varadkar said he hoped the Government could provide this in the coming days.“It will probably be in the form of childcare in the home rather than opening up creches because there will be risks involved with that. We don’t want to do anything that might cause the virus to spread.”On State exams, he said the plan is that they will go ahead and said that the Government wanted to see students start in college as they had planned.“I would encourage anyone studying for their Junior Cert and Leaving Cert to continue to do so.”Furthermore, he acknowledged that there is pressure on the testing services for Covid 19 and said that “we are not where we want to be”. He has asked the HSE to provide him with a report by next Monday containing a roadmap on how to increase testing and address any issues.An incorporeal Cabinet meeting was also held on Thursday to approve the decision to defer the new system of allocation of special needs assistants.There was also Cabinet approval to extend indemnity to private hospitals and certain labs.The Taoiseach also said that in terms of supply chains, there is a solid and secure supply but there were “minor issues around the economic viability of some shipping routes and air cargo routes.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4219299.1585846820!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus austrian supermarket mask rule divides experts","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA protective face mask is handed over to a customer of a Spar supermarket during  coronavirus  outbreak in Vienna, Austria on Wednesday. Photograph: Leonhard FoegerReuters When Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz introduced a public ban on headscarves and veils in 2017, he described such head and face coverings as a “symbol of a counter-society”. Now Kurz is leading the Austrian avant garde once more – in the other direction. From Monday, if you refuse to cover your face in Austria, you can’t go shopping for food.“It’s clear that masks are something alien to our culture,” said Kurz, announcing the latest coronavirus regulation. “It will be a big adjustment but it is necessary, we’re taking this step to reduce further the spread of the virus”.Given Kurz has changed his mind before on headscarves and face coverings, ordinary Austrians have taken the new policy in their stride.“I think it’s good, particularly if it protects supermarket staff,” said Edeltraud Michtner, outside a Vienna supermarket, to Austrian broadcaster ORF.Student Dominik Heide was more sceptical: “Perhaps it makes sense inside where people are gathered but it’s not necessary outside.”Government reimbursementAs well as masks in supermarkets, the new regulation obliges all police to wear masks in public. Conservative estimates envision a daily requirement of three million masks. Given global shortages in protective gear, retailers have asked customers, where possible, to bring their own mask or scarf. They have already begun distributing free to customers all masks they can source but, at a price of 40 cent to 80 cent each, they expect the government to reimburse them later.“There are still thousands of small retailers without them,” said Peter Buchmüller of Salzburg’s chamber of commerce. “How they will get their masks is a big question and how can we distribute three million masks a day – where will they come from?”As well as cost and logistic questions, not everyone is convinced the masks make a difference to public health. Current World Health Organisation guidelines recommend masks for those who are sick but say there is no specific evidence of any benefit from widespread mask-wearing. With no boost to public health, it said the main effect is psychological.Some Austrian doctors are concerned that few will heed the golden rules of wearing a mask: don with disinfected hands, without touching the main mask. Others fear that mask-wearers might feel more protected than they are and become lax in other measures to reduce virus transmission.Announcing the policy, Kurz insisted the masks being distributed were not medical grade and had limited effect. Social distancing and hand-washing, he said, remained the most effective virus prevention measures.But his early move has increased pressure on other countries to follow suit. Some medical journals have carried papers giving cautious backing for widespread mask use, in particular because it reduces the likelihood of someone without symptoms spreading the virus unwittingly.Unconvinced chancellorLeading the mask sceptics in Germany is Dr Hendrik Streeck, head of the University of Bonn’s Virology Institute.“There is no danger of infecting someone when you’re shopping,” he said, noting that Europe’s main super-spreader events were social events such as parties and sport events. “Infection didn’t come from supermarkets or butchers or restaurants. It came from long periods together in closed spaces.”While the eastern German city of Jena has become the first to introduce a mask rule for two weeks, chancellor Angela Merkel remains unconvinced. She told a meeting with state governors on Wednesday that masks themselves can become a virus risk after half an hour, when they become saturated with breath condensation.Austria has nearly 11,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, according to official figures yesterday, with 162 registered deaths to date. Germany has 75,000 cases and more than 900 deaths.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4219244.1585843964!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland joins criticism of hungary after orban power grab","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFine Gael TD Neale Richmond:  “One of the stated aims of this commission is the maintenance of the rule of law.” Photograph: Nick BradshawIreland joined 12 other members of the European Union to appeal for pandemic emergency measures to respect rule of law and be time-limited in a joint statement after Hungary’s imposition of indefinite rule by decree.Without mentioning Hungary by name, the joint statement from the 13 invited the European Commission to scrutinise emergency measures taken in response to the coronavirus pandemic and monitor whether “the fundamental values of the Union are upheld”.“In this unprecedented situation, it is legitimate that member states adopt extraordinary measures to protect their citizens and overcome the crisis,” the countries wrote. “We are however deeply concerned about the risk of violations of the principles of rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights arising from the adoption of certain emergency measures.”“Emergency measures should be limited to what is strictly necessary, should be proportionate and temporary in nature, subject to regular scrutiny, and respect the aforementioned principles and international law obligations. They should not restrict the freedom of expression or the freedom of the press,” it added.The declaration was issued by Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden.DilemmaFine Gael TD Neale Richmond said the imposition of indefinite direct rule in Hungary amounted to a serious dilemma for the EU.“It certainly poses a challenge to the European Union,” Mr Richmond said. “One of the stated aims of this commission is the maintenance of the rule of law. That’s one of the core values of the European Union: democracy and rule of law. It is something that can’t go past unchallenged.”Mr Orban’s Fidesz party is in the same pan-European political party as Fine Gael in the European Parliament. It was suspended from the European People’s Party (EPP), a grouping of right-leaning national parties, amid concerns about rule of law last year.Allies of Mr Orban in Eastern Europe have blocked past attempts to sanction Budapest and to outright expel Fidesz from the EPP, but Mr Orban’s latest move has galvinised support for outright expulsion, including in Ireland, Finland and Malta.Seán Kelly, Fine Gael’s leader in the European Parliament, has called for Fidesz to be expelled from the EPP.“There is a feeling that Orban may be looking to be expelled rather than to leave voluntarily,” Mr Kelly said. “He could play the victim, and some people think that’s what he’s aiming for . . . certainly since suspension there hasn’t been any pulling back from any of the actions he has taken.”RefugeesOn Friday, the European Court of Justice ruled that Poland, Hungary and Czech Republic broke EU law by refusing to take in refugees, laying the ground for a fresh clash between eastern states and European institutions.At the height of the migration crisis in 2015, Poland and the Czech Republic agreed to accept 100 and 50 migrants under a burden-sharing plan agreed by EU leaders.The court said that Poland ultimately took in none, the Czech Republic only 12, and that Hungary had refused to take any people from the outset.\u0026nbspThe failure of the burden-sharing plan is a major source of acrimony in the EU, as countries like Italy and Greece feel they have been left to shoulder a disproportionate responsibility for people fleeing poverty and war.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4219453.1585857976!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk makes another coronavirus u turn but doubts over strategy linger","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMatt Hancock: out of self-isolation just a week after his positive coronavirus test. Photograph: Pippa Fowles10 Downing StreetAFP via GettyAfter a succession of daily press briefings from Downing Street that saw ministers fail hopelessly to answer reporters’ questions about coronavirus, Matt Hancock’s performance on Thursday evening looked almost like a tour de force. The health secretary, fresh out of self-isolation after testing positive for the virus himself, gave lengthy answers and invited follow-up questions in a briefing that lasted almost three times as long as usual.Unlike his colleagues earlier in the week, he had a big announcement to make as he set a goal of 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of April. He acknowledged public disquiet over the slow pace of testing in the UK, which has struggled to reach 10,000 a day, saying he understands why the government’s approach has faced criticism.But Hancock’s apparent candour and the determination with which he set out a five-point plan to scale up testing could not disguise the dramatic U-turn he was performing or obscure the doubts that linger over the new strategy.The health secretary’s press briefing followed a video message on Wednesday night from a distinctly peaky-looking Boris Johnson, who has also tested positive for coronavirus and remains in self-isolation in Downing Street.“I want to say a special word about testing because it is so important. As I have said for weeks and weeks, this is the way through: this is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle, this is how we will defeat it in the end,” the prime minister said.Just a week ago, however, deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries was dismissing the World Health Organisation’s injunction to “test, test, test” as a message aimed at less developed countries than the UK. She said that “there comes a point in a pandemic where that is not an appropriate intervention”, adding that the UK had always planned to focus on testing those who were admitted to hospital.Testing timesWhen Johnson promised two weeks ago to ramp up testing to 250,000 a day, he was referring to a blood test that could tell if someone has had the virus and has developed antibodies showing that they now hopefully have some immunity to it. But as John Newton, director of public health improvement for Public Health England, pointed out at Thursday’s press briefing, the focus should instead be on a swab antigen test that shows if someone has the virus now.“The initial priority, of course, is for the swab tests because those are tests which allow the NHS to manage critically ill patients to the best they possibly can and also to allow NHS staff and other key workers to come back to work when they can,” he said.“The antibody tests are ideally done 28 days after an infection, so in fact the requirement for the antibody test isn’t really with us yet. So the urgent priority – both types of tests are important, both are urgent – but the most urgent is the swab tests so that we can treat patients better and get staff back to work.”The government’s U-turn on testing came after usually friendly newspapers including the Daily Mail and the Daily  criticised the lack of testing for frontline National Health Service staff. Many doctors and nurses are off work because they or family members are displaying symptoms of the virus but they have been unable to get tested.Virus suppressionThe government’s pivot on testing follows its change of strategy last month away from a policy of trying to mitigate the virus towards suppressing it. In both cases, the change of direction is welcome and brings the UK into closer alignment with the international mainstream in combating the coronavirus.Each time, ministers and public health officials have denied that they have changed direction and have refused to admit that they may have wasted valuable time pursuing misguided strategies. And Hancock’s continued emphasis on antibody tests on Thursday suggests that the government remains attached to the hope that evidence of widespread immunity could be the way to get the UK back to work.He even endorsed the idea of an “immunity certificate” that those who have recovered from coronavirus could use as a passport back into work.

Dogs aren\u0027t necessarily deliberately hunting for birds, they bump into them and you can\u0027t take away the birds natural instinct to get away. If this happens continually they are away from their nests, the eggs chill and they are at more risk of predation.”  He said that skylarks, curlews, grey partridges, corn buntings stand to have a really good year this year.  This is because despite lockdown farmers are still doing their conservation projects.Fewer cars in the road means less roadkill, conservationists have said, meaning the lockdown could be a lifeline for hedgehogs, toads and other frequently-squashed creatures.Sue Patchett from the toad patrol in West Yorkshire told the Today Programme: Having the coronavirus, the lockdown, is going to have a massive effect on toad migration all up and down the country.   The main danger to toads is cars, but with coronavirus it should be so much easier for the toads to travel to their destinations. This year they will have a better chance of spawning.  Mr Swan agreed, adding  The less cars there are on the road the less wildlife road casualties there are for animals, hedgehogs and birds in particular get squashed on the road. Blackbirds, pheasants squabble at each other in the middle of the road and have no idea what the traffic is doing so they end up getting squashed.”  The closure of pubs and restaurants has meant a lessening demand for fish and seafood. Because of this, many fishing businesses are going out to sea less frequently or have paused operations for now.   The Marine Conservation Society said this could help our fish stocks recover.  A spokesperson told The : “It’s certainly feasible that some stocks could be subjected to reduced fishing pressure due to the drop in demand as a result of the pandemic, but whether or not that reduction is sustained long enough for populations to increase is hard to predict.  “There is no question that Covid-19 is upending the global seafood trade, supply chains and reducing demand on food-services such as eat-in restaurants.   “If we saw reduced fishing operations over the lockdown period due to Covid-19 and reduce catch volumes directly relating to this, this in turn could potentially impact some fish stocks status in the long run.”   The insects of Britain may be enjoying a brief respite from the tyranny of the trampling foot.  Matt Shardlow, the CEO of Buglife, said that oil-beetles on coastal footpaths are likely to do well as a result of the lockdown if fewer people are travelling to the coast for their walks.  He added, however, that he is concerned that movement restrictions mean conservationists will find it difficult to continue their work looking after endangered species, including reintroduction programmes. Mr Shardlow explained: “It is important that wherever restrictions allow we keep the work going that is enabling the continued survival of other species, and that enables us to assess the health of the countryside during this period.”Washing our hands more often may be hurting the invertebrates in our rivers, he added, explaining: “Anti-bacterial chemicals in handwashes can be persistent and harmful to the environment, an increase in the volume of anti-bacterial chemicals going through sewage works could harm river life.”  One bug which is likely to flourish this spring due to lockdown is the bumblebee.  The conservationist said:  “On the other-hand reduced economic activity will reduce air pollution, which will help bees find flowers – exhaust fumes disguise floral scents – and reduce the current damaging eutrophication of grasslands, wetlands, heathlands and woodlands.”   More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"china reintroduces coronavirus restrictions country tries get","story":"China is bringing back some coronavirus restrictions amid fears of a second wave of infections as the country of 1.4 billion people attempts to return to normal life.Yunnan, a southern province bordering Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam, has blocked citizens leaving from ports in an effort to prevent them returning with the disease. Cinemas have also been ordered to shut once more. Shanghai, the largest city in China with 25 million people, has closed tourist attractions after a brief period of welcoming guests while entertainment venues such as bars and internet cafes have been shuttered across the country.Beijing has lately signalled that the virus has been beaten, lifting restrictions in the most badly ravaged parts of China. Xi Jinping, leader of the ruling Chinese Communist Party, this week visited Zhejiang province, the second-hardest hit province after Hubei and was pictured without a face mask for the first time in months. Numbers reported by China do appear to be subsiding, with no local transmissions again on April 1. All 35 new cases were due to imported infections, national health authorities said Thursday.But doubts persist over whether the figures reflect the scale of the outbreak, as hospitals were immediately overwhelmed when the pandemic hit. Several revisions to how cases are counted have also caused confusion. And until Wednesday, health authorities were not including asymptomatic patients in the official tally. The central government has yet to reschedule its postponed annual parliamentary meetings, a major political event experts say will be a key indicator that things are indeed returning to normal.Authorities are still concerned about imported infections, and have banned foreigners from entering the country while ordering a sharp reduction in the number of international flights. Since emerging in China late last year, the novel coronavirus has now infected more than 950,000 people and killed about 48,300.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"drivers make non essential journeys could void insurance","story":"Drivers who use their cars to make non-essential journeys during the coronavirus lockdown could be voiding their insurance, a leading motoring lawyer has warned.Despite the widespread travel restrictions currently in place, the latest data suggests traffic is beginning to increase again, as motorists tire of being stuck at home.Police have also been forced to warn people against using their cars to drive to beauty spots in order to take their permitted daily exercise.Critics of the current road restrictions insist that driving from A to B in a car does not risk spreading the Covid-19 virus.But Nick Freeman, the lawyer, who became known as Mr Loophole, after helping a string of celebrity clients escape motoring charges, said making non essential journeys could actually mean the driver is not insured.He said: “Essential travel is largely defined as shopping for necessities, picking up medical supplies, caring for a vulnerable person and getting to and from work if you cannot do so from home.“Anything else is not really acceptable so if you have an accident and cannot prove your journey was essential your insurance may be void.”There is also a warning about motorists whose MOTs have expired and are involved in accidents.Due to the current lockdown car owners, whose MOT was due have been issued with a temporary six month extension.But Mr Freeman said drivers would still be liable if they were involved in an accident caused by the defective state of their car.He said: “The MOT sabbatical isn`t a get-out clause for tyres with no tread, defective brakes  or faulty suspension. You can`t hide behind the fact you could not get an MOT done.“It is the responsibility of the motorist to ensure their vehicle is roadworthy. Otherwise you could face anything from penalty points and a fine to prison depending on the allegation.“If your car has not had an MOT because of the six month sabbatical rule you  must notify your insurance company, as it could affect your premium and you might find your policy is voided.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nigeria launches massive joint operation against jihadists","story":"The announcement comes after Chad\u0027s defence minister said Tuesday his country had deployed forces across its neighbours\u0027 borders to battle insurgents who killed almost 100 Chadian soldiers last month.Nigeria\u0027s military said attacks by fighters from Boko Haram and a splinter group affiliated to the so-called Islamic State group had necessitated the contiguous nations of the Lake Chad basin to jointly launch this massive onslaught.Details about the operation were sketchy.

Not on cellphones, not on taps, not on doorknobs, he told the Markus Lanz talk show on ZDF television. His team even examined the fur of the family\u0027s pet cat but found no trace of the virus.The virologist said his initial findings challenged many of the assumptions behind current lockdown measures around the world.We talk a lot about speculation and models, but only one factor has to be wrong and then the whole thing collapses like a house of cards, Prof Streeck said. There have been widespread calls in Germany for face masks to be made compulsory at supermarkets, but Prof Streeck said: There are no proven infections while shopping or at the hairdresser. He stressed that he was not calling for lockdown measures to be lifted, but argued that not enough is yet known about the virus.Prof Streeck has led the response to the coronavirus in one Germany\u0027s worst affected regions, North Rhine-Westphalia, and diagnosed thousands of patients.He is leading a detailed study in Gangelt, a town in the Heinsberg district which saw the first major coronavirus outbreak in Germany.Prof Streeck pointed to the country\u0027s first recorded case, a woman who travelled to Germany from China and infected colleagues at work, as evidence for his analysis. This woman would have stayed in a hotel, eaten in the restaurant, but only infected her colleagues, he said. So we know that eating in a restaurant or working in a hotel is not responsible for the infection. The virus spreads in other places: the party in Ischgl, the club in Berlin, the football game in Bergamo.Ischgl, a ski resort in Austria known for its nightlife, is believed to have been a major centre of the European outbreak where the virus was spread by drinking games in which people shared glasses.We know it\u0027s not a smear infection that is transmitted by touching objects, but that close dancing and exuberant celebrations have led to infections, said Prof Streeck.

Ms Tannis did not know what to advise. In the end the woman just repeated: “Mommy, I love you” over and over. “Normally the families can be at the bedside and can have that moment of closure,” said Ms Tannis, who has been a critical care nurse for almost 20 years. “The sad and the scary part is they can’t. They\u0027re not allowed to … I think that is what hurts us the most.” Such tragedies were once rarities in New York City. Now, with Covid-19 rampant, they are seen almost daily, not just in Brookdale but in hospitals across the city. The coronavirus case numbers in New York, the epicentre of the US outbreak, are mind-boggling. Around 46,000 residents have tested positive. That is roughly one in 20 of the world total, or one in five of US cases. It dwarfs Britain\u0027s figure of 34,000.  The surge, up from zero a little more than a month ago, has put immense pressure on the city\u0027s hospitals, with numbers forecast to soar for at least another fortnight. The   has talked to 10 healthcare workers on the frontline of the city\u0027s battle against coronavirus to understand what is really happening on the ground. People working in intensive care units, emergency rooms and ambulances agreed to speak, some asking for anonymity. Hospital administrators, trade union leaders and New York City officials were also interviewed. A consistent picture emerges of hospitals struggling to deal with unprecedented demand, healthcare workers fearing for their safety and widespread shock at the scale of deaths from Covid-19 - already more than 1,300 in New York City. “People are dying, just dying left and right,” one patient care assistant said. “Each day I just hope we see fewer deaths than the last,” said a nurse. A paramedic said: It is like a war zone. The most consistent complaint, and the issue triggering most frustration towards US President Donald Trump, is the lack of personal protective equipment such as masks, face shields and gloves. The availability of N95 masks was repeatedly raised. Usually, when used for operations where infection is possible, the masks - which form a tight vacuum around the mouth and nose - are thrown away after each use. Yet multiple New York healthcare workers said they were being made to use a single mask for at least a week. Some hospitals even have tables of brown paper bags inidually named where masks can be kept overnight. Gowns are in short supply too. Headlines were made last month when a photograph of three employees at Mount Sinai West hospital posing in bin bags for overalls emerged. The hospitals said they had proper protection on underneath. Yet a nurse who worked there said concerns over the lack of equipment was real. “We are paranoid,” she said. “I don’t know what we have to do or say so they believe us – so they hear our cry for help.” Other shortages are emerging. Ventilators which keep a patient breathing in the most serious cases were once never used for more than one person in some New York hospitals. Now they can be split between two or even three patients. The rapid expansion of bed space - every New York hospital has been asked to increase beds by 50 per cent - is a sign of success. Everything from Wall Street high-rises and Manhattan hotels to the US Open tennis centre have been converted. Yet there has not been an equivalent increase in staff, meaning people are thrown into unfamiliar roles, attempting to handle a pandemic that remains little understood. It\u0027s really bad,” said a pediatric nurse at an NYU medical centre now redeployed. “You\u0027re working on a unit you\u0027ve never worked on before so you don\u0027t know where anything is. You don\u0027t know the doctors, you don\u0027t know the other nurses.The immense pressure being forced on the city’s healthcare system is felt from start to finish.Medical emergency calls to 911 have spiked, with more than 6,500 a day - a third higher than normal. Such levels have not been since the September 11 attacks. At the same time Covid-19 is ravaging the emergency response workforce. Some 20 per cent are off work, up from around six per cent in normal times. That means waiting times for ambulances are increasing.Michael Greco, a paramedic working in Queens for 13 years and a president at the union Local 2507, said hundreds of ambulances had been called from other parts of the state to help meet demand and firefighters were stepping in as drivers.Once at the hospitals, the problems continue. Mr Greco claimed one Harlem hospital was so busy that a doctor came out to treat a Covid-19 patient in the ambulance. Resuscitation was attempted and the person was pronounced dead without ever entering the ward. “In my 13 years I’ve never seen anything close to this,” Mr Greco said. “We\u0027ve gone through blizzards, we’ve gone through a micro-tornado, we’ve had Hurricane Sandy. Those, while all major operations, were time-stamped. This has now been two weeks.”And then there is what comes next for those who do not make it. New York City authorities have ordered in 45 refrigerated trucks that are now positioned ominously by hospitals - a sight, again, not seen across the city since 911.They are being used to store dead bodies. Usually the city’s morgues have capacity for around 900 bodies. That has been been increased to 3,500 as officials brace for the worst. “We are trying our hardest to treat these people with respect and dignity,” said Aja Worthy-Davis, a spokesman for the city’s chief medical officer. But it is another emotional toll on nurses. “When their families ask if they can see them, it’s impossible to tell them where they are, said one nurse of those that pass. No one wants to think of their loved ones being in a freezer truck. Aside from the elongated hours, the pressure of treating the sick and the mental anguish of seeing so much death, another fear hangs over the medical workers - the concern of contracting Covid-19 themselves. One New York hospital worker compared beginning a shift right now to “going into a war without any armour”. Another said: It is like walking into a burning building just knowing you’re going to get burned.”Above all the concern is passing the disease on to loved ones. One woman who works in a Staten Island hospital described the lengths she takes every day to make sure the virus is not accidentally carried home to her children She drives home sitting on plastic bags which are then binned. Once there she removes her uniform before entering, puts it straight in the washing machine and takes a shower. She then wipes every surface touched with disinfectant, gargles salt water and lemon - she has heard it helps avoid infection - and uses a saline nasal spray. “I stay focused because I don’t want to miss a step. One wrong thing I could do at home could mean infecting everybody else. I could never forgive myself,” she said. Most worrying of all for New York’s doctors and nurses is that the worst is yet to come. Bill de Blasio, the city’s mayor, issued an urgent nationwide call for more resources earlier this week, giving Sunday as the deadline. On his wish list was 3.3 million N95 masks, 100,000 isolation gowns and 400 ventilators as well as 1,000 more nurses, 300 respiratory therapists and 150 doctors. Here is the blunt truth: without them, now, New Yorkers we could have saved will die, Mr de Blasio wrote in a letter to the US president. There are three days remaining. For Ms Tannis, speaking with swollen feet propped up after another gruelling day of disease and death, it was hard to imagine that things can get worse. “I am emotionally spent,” she said. “I don’t think I can produce the words … You have no idea what is happening inside hospitals. You have no idea how people are being traumatised.”She pleaded with New Yorkers, and all Americans, to take in a simple message: I implore you. People need to understand - stay home.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"stop reaching bottle lockdown says world health organization","story":"Stay-at-home Britons are being urged to cut down on alcohol to avoid making themselves more vulnerable to coronavirus.The World Health Organization (WHO) said it was crucial for people to try and maintain a healthy lifestyle in lockdown or risk raising their chance of infection.The charity We Are With You - formerly Addaction - also warned that increased social isolation could lead to a surge in harmful drinking.Studies have shown that drinking too much alcohol can suppress the immune system and make people more vulnerable to infection.The state of a person\u0027s health before they become infected with Covid-19 appears to play a crucial role in determining how well they recover, global health leaders said.The European branch of WHO urged people to stop drinking and smoking, get regular exercise, and maintain a healthy diet.Hans Henri Kluge, Regional Director for WHO in Europe, said: It is becoming clear that the healthier you were before the pandemic plays a crucial role. People who age healthily are less at risk.For those in self-quarantine or working from home, it is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle with good nutrition, physical activity and staying away from tobacco and alcohol.People are also advised to reduce sitting time, getting up for at least three minutes every hour use household chores to be active and aim for a daily goal such as 30 minutes of activity.Online classes, strolls in the park, while maintaining social distancing, and dancing to music could also help, WHO said.Research has shown that people in poor health are far more likely to die from coronavirus, with eight in 10 deaths occurring in people with at least one illness such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes.And the current lockdown could increase unhealthy habits.Laura Bunt, Acting Chief Executive at the charity We Are With You added: Harmful drinking can impact people\u0027s physical and mental health.These are really difficult times for everyone. Our experience of working with people to reduce the amount of alcohol they drink shows that social isolation is a big factor in why people may drink more heavily.Coupled with the huge anxiety of living through a pandemic, this means we could see a big rise in people drinking more alcohol at home.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"venezuelan naval vessel goes confrontation portuguese cruise","story":"A cruise company has said that one of its liners was shot at and rammed by a Venezuelan navy vessel, which ended up sinking after the clash in the Caribbean.Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro accused the captain of the RCGS Resolute cruise ship, which sails under a Portuguese flag, of “terrorism and piracy” by deliberating ramming the offshore patrol vessel.The bizarre incident occurred a day before President Donald Trump announced he was deploying more US Navy warships and aircraft to the Caribbean to stop “corrupt actors” like President Maduro exploiting the coronavirus pandemic to smuggle narcotics.According to the Hamburg-based Columbia Cruise Services (CCS), the Resolute was idling in international waters off the uninhabited Venezuelan island of La Tortuga, with the 32-member crew performing maintenance work and no passengers on board.The CCS says the Venezuelan Naiguatá patrol vessel approached after midnight, radioing the captain to question the Resolute’s presence and ordering him to sail to Puerto Moreno on the island of Margarita.The statement says the Resolute’s captain asked for confirmation of the order as Margarita constituted a major deviation from the cruise ship’s planned route towards Curaçao.The company’s version is that Resolute’s “ice-strengthened bulbous bow” resisted the navy vessel’s ramming to the point that the latter’s hull was damaged, but Venezuela’s president insisted the cruise ship had been the aggressor.   According to Caracas, the 44 crew on board the Naiguatá patrol vessel were saved by Venezuelan rescue services in the early hours of Tuesday morning. CCS claimed its offers to help were not accepted.“The Portuguese vessel that rammed ours is eight times bigger,” Mr Maduro said.“It is as if a heavyweight boxer grabbed hold of a boy learning to box and hit him.”The incident was described as “unfortunate” by Portugal’s foreign minister, Augusto Santos Silva, after Venezuela registered a complaint with Portugal’s embassy in Caracas.Relations have been strained between Lisbon and Caracas recently, after Venezuela suspended TAP Air Portugal flights in February after accusing the uncle of opposition leader Juan Guaído of transporting explosives into the country on a TAP flight.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/02/20/andrew-lloyd-webber.jpg","title":"andrew lloyd webber musicals watch online joseph technicolour dreamcoat cats shows must go on","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Recorded versions of the composer’s beloved musicals will be made freely available each weekA series of musicals from theatre icon\u0026nbspAndrew Lloyd Webber will be made available online for free\u0026nbspwhile theatres on Broadway and London\u0027s\u0026nbspWest End are closed because of the coronavirus pandemic.Filmed versions of his shows will be uploaded to the YouTube channel The Show Must Go On! each week, where they can be viewed freely for 48 hours.The first musical to appear on the channel will be\u0026nbspJoseph and the Technicolour Dreamcoat, which will go live at 11am on 3 April 2020.

The UK is following a similar infection rate trajectory to France and currently has close to 30,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19.​In the US, where cases have now topped 200,000, private companies are being ordered under the Korean War-era Defense Production Act to manufacture products needed to treat patients.General Motors and Ford are both building tens of thousands of ventilators for hospitals in the US, while Tesla CEO Elon Musk has offered to manufacture and deliver ventilators for free to countries suffering from shortages.“If Elon Musk wants to help, by all means, let’s talk. We are eager to work with any manufacturer wanting to be part of the solution,” Mr Nussenbaum said.“The need is urgent. To any manufacturers or suppliers out there, please get in touch if you think you can help. To those who need help, we have a solid platform in place that’s ready to be used.”Co-CEO Philippe Corrot added: “This platform is a testament to the power of collaboration: bringing together tech, government, producers and distributors into one place.“Most importantly, this platform is a testament to the people who, in times of great need, have come together to do great things.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The first are\u0026nbspthe swab tests already being used, which indicate if people have the virus. The second are\u0026nbspantibody tests –\u0026nbspyet to have their accuracy confirmed –\u0026nbspbut which are hoped will provide a quick way of finding out whether somebody has already had the virus and therefore has developed\u0026nbspimmunity.\u0026nbspMr Hancock said\u0026nbspantibody tests would allow the immune to go back to work.Professor John Newton from Public Health England said\u0026nbspantibody tests are ideally done 28 days after an infection, “so the requirement isn’t really with us yet”.The tests would also form part of a national surveillance programme, which Mr Hancock said is “essential” to know how the virus is spreading and will inform the government about policies on social distancing and ending the lockdown.So far, antibody tests have not been rolled out to the wider public in any country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailEarlier this week, former WHO director Professor Anthony Costello criticised the UK’s response to the crisis, saying the country already has the capacity to carry out swab tests on hundreds of thousands more people.He said: “By mass testing, we can detect new outbreaks and there will be much less disruption rather than isolating the whole economy.”He warned a rapid acceleration was the only way for the UK to avoid a painful six months before society “returns to normal”, as the public was warned on Sunday.“We must go to mass testing and, when we remove the lockdown, I don’t think it will take six months. All the Asian states –\u0026nbspit was six to eight weeks before being able to lift the lockdown,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Following mounting frustration, the prime minister said in a video message on Wednesday evening that upping the level of testing would be the means by which the UK defeats the coronavirus.He said: “I want to say a special word about testing, because it is so important, and as I have said for weeks and weeks, this is the way through.“This is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle. This is how we will defeat it in the end.”Mr Johnson said access to testing would enable staff currently forced to self-isolate – either because they had symptoms or shared a household with someone who had symptoms – to know if they were safe to work.Following this video, the government has also indicated people could be given “immunity certificates” to prove they have recovered from coronavirus and would be eligible to leave the lockdown early.The move, already planned in Germany, will be “considered” if hoped-for antibody tests\u0026nbspbecome available on a mass scale, No\u0026nbsp10 has said.Earlier this week, shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: “Germany appears to be leading the way in the testing and we have much to learn from their approach. I’ve repeatedly called for more testing and contact tracing in the UK, and we should be looking at initiatives like this closely.”Professor David Alexander from UCL’s Institute for Risk and\u0026nbspDisaster Reduction and an expert in pandemic epidemiology told The Independent the UK must expand its testing programme as well as ensure it is targeted.He said: “Widespread testing is essential. It will not stop lockdown, but with very careful management it might ease it, as well as helping to contain the disease.\u0026nbsp“Epidemiology is not about blanket, untargeted measures. It is about identifying sources of a disease, determining why and how they are sources, and enacting carefully designed measures to deal with the mechanisms. This needs to be done, now, on a much larger scale.”He said despite 12 years’\u0026nbspknowledge of the likelihood of such a scenario playing out, governments had not heeded advice and are now unnecessarily playing catch up.“So much of what could have been prepared for in advance is now the subject of frantic improvisation,” he said.\u0026nbsp“The focus is on reacting to infection more than on preventing it. That is the result of lack of foresight. And yet we have had the full scenario since 2008. Since 2005, we have known what the needs are likely to be.”\u0026nbspHe added: “I am sad that normalcy bias, the syndrome of personal invulnerability and cognitive dissonance stopped our leaders from reacting more firmly in the early stages.”In China, which stunned the world when it locked down first the entire city of Wuhan, and later the entire province of Hubei, as it sought to contain the virus, the government has now begun to ease controls, providing optimism for other countries implementing quarantine lockdowns.Professor of spatial demography and epidemiology at the University of Southampton, Andrew Tatem, said:\u0026nbsp “The easing of lockdown restrictions in Hubei and soon in Wuhan offer hope for much of the rest of the world that an end to the stringent control measures can be in sight.\u0026nbsp“Along with a few other countries that have been at the forefront of tackling the disease early, China has provided valuable lessons about how the outbreak can be controlled.”But he warned that though China is beginning to lift restrictions, it remains highly vulnerable to further outbreaks of Covid-19.He said: “The lessons we can next learn from China are about which restrictions can safely be lifted, when, where, for whom, and what still needs to stay in place.\u0026nbsp“While Wuhan suffered a major outbreak, the vast majority of people in China did not contract the disease. This means that the risk of further outbreaks remains very high, especially with so many cases now outside of China and importation becoming a new problem.\u0026nbsp“Making sure that the country doesn’t suffer repeated outbreaks requiring new lockdowns will be a major priority for authorities in China, and the rest of the world should look carefully to see what happens and learn from it.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

So are the authorities here doing enough?\u0026nbsp1 How have other countries responded to the coronavirus threat?The disease has spread to more than 200 countries and territories, killing tens of thousands of people, with the US, Italy and Spain recording more cases and more deaths than China.\u0026nbspIn its efforts to stop the deadly pandemic, the World Health Organisation has told countries to “test, test, test”.The world was stunned when China locked down first the entire city of Wuhan, and later the entire province of Hubei, as it sought to contain the virus. Such an enormous quarantine plan had never before been attempted in the modern world, but by the middle of March, Beijing’s decision appeared to be vindicated as cases tumbled rapidly, then stopped.South Korea, which was hit early with a cluster of cases, embarked on the world’s most ambitious virus-testing programme ever seen. By the beginning of March, the country was able to test 20,000 people a day and implemented stringent tracing efforts to track down people who had been in contact with those known to be infected.To date, South Korea has had 9,887 confirmed cases and 165 deaths, making its death rate 1 per cent, compared to a global death rate of 3.4 per cent.\u0026nbspIn Germany, 70,000 people a day are now being tested for the disease, and the death rate is under 1 per cent. A similar rate has also been seen in Austria where intense testing is underway.Even America, which under Donald Trump has been slow to accept the impact of the disease, is now testing more people per capita than the UK.Mr Trump even criticised Boris Johnson personally for the UK’s response to the crisis during a televised address this week.2 How many people are being tested in the UK?In the UK, the government has been accused of failing to prepare in the face of incessant warnings, and over the weekend failed to hit its own stated target of testing 10,000 people a day. Fewer than 5,000 inidual patients were tested for the disease on Saturday.Fewer than 153,000 people have been tested for the virus to date, according to figures released on Wednesday.The result is the government is now coming under even greater pressure over current levels of testing, as the UK experienced its biggest day-on-day rise in deaths so far.Ministers have said the UK is now aiming to test 25,000 people a day by the middle of April.3 Why are numbers lower than might be expected?Earlier in March, as the UK government pursued its controversial plans to only test people admitted to hospital, delayed closing schools, and banning large gatherings citing concerns over “behavioural fatigue” if too many restrictions came in too early, other countries and global bodies looked on in disbelief.When tactics changed later in the month, the UK found itself at the back of a long queue for essential equipment.Asked why the UK was only testing around 8,000 people a day while Germany was working on about 70,000 a day, Mr Johnson’s official spokesman said on Monday there have been difficulties in “getting all the equipment they need to conduct these tests at a time when everybody in the world wants them”.4 What does it mean for health workers?The lack of testing equipment in Britain has even meant essential frontline medical staff have been unable to be tested for the virus, resulting in those with\u0026nbspCovid-19-like\u0026nbspsymptoms being forced to self-isolate, when many of them may not in fact have the disease, thereby reducing the already critically low numbers of doctors, nurses and healthcare workers.On Wednesday, healthcare leaders warned there still remains “no immediate prospect” of mass\u0026nbspNHS\u0026nbspstaff testing.NHS\u0026nbsptrusts were told earlier this week they may only use up to 15 per cent of any spare testing capacity for\u0026nbspNHS\u0026nbspstaff.But Health Secretary Matt Hancock has now scrapped that cap, telling\u0026nbspNHS\u0026nbsphospital labs to use all spare capacity to test their frontline workers.5 What is being done to increase testing in the UK?The UK is currently working towards a target of testing 25,000 people a day within the next three weeks.The 25,000 figure comes despite promises made last week by NHS medical director Professor Stephen Powis who said there would be “hundreds of thousands of tests” a day within the next few weeks.Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, told the Press Association this week maximum testing capacity in the UK was currently “very constrained” and only able to deliver around 13,000 tests per day.The focus remains on testing patients in hospital to see if they have Covid-19, rather than the wider public.Public Health England (PHE) has also come under fire over its stance on wider testing of members of the public for the virus.The organisation has repeatedly said most adults in good health who develop symptoms will fully recover and do not need to be tested.However, many scientists disagree and say it is only through widespread testing the UK will be able to emerge from lockdown.On Tuesday, former WHO director Professor Anthony Costello criticised the UK\u0027s response to the crisis, saying the country does have the capacity to test hundreds of thousands more people.He said: “By mass testing, we can detect new outbreaks and there will be much less disruption rather than isolating the whole economy.“We have 44 molecular virology labs in the UK. If they were doing 400 tests a day, we would be up to Germany levels of testing (around 70,000 a day) and that is perfectly feasible.”He warned a rapid acceleration was the only way for the UK to avoid a painful six months before society “returns to normal”, as the public was warned on Sunday.“We must go to mass testing and, when we remove the lockdown, I don’t think it will take six months. All the Asian states — it was six to eight weeks of being able to lift the lockdown,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Unfortunately, it will be a little longer. Top Gun: Maverick will fly this December. Stay safe, everyone.Clap for our carers due to take place at 8pmA nationwide round of applause for NHS workers is due to take place at 8pm.BBC One, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 will all pause broadcasting while the applause take place for the second week.Irish health chief - virus has become a \u0027household disease\u0027Ireland\u0027s chief medical officer said that coronavirus has become a more household disease which families are exposed to at home, rather than in the wider community.Dr Tony Holohan told a briefing that the contact type in the Republic of Ireland was more limited to within households that communities.He added that while the discovery is encouraging, the number of people that iniduals come in to contact with needs to fall further.If each person on average is to infect another three people then this infection is going to continue to grow, Dr Holohan said.Hancock denies lockdown was too lateAsked whether the lockdown came in too late, Mr Hancock said they took the right measures at the right time on the basis of the best available science.\u0026nbspThe challenge is these measures are stringent - we get that, he said.Ministers still hoped to get to 250,000 after the goal of 100,000 a day is reached.He gave a shout-out to staff for Public Health England who were working around the clock to keep people safe.Ministers want mass testing for those who have recoveredThe government does want to get to mass community testing, and the timing depended on how soon a home antibody test - to check whether someone is immune - could be obtained, Mr Hancock said.It was unrealistic to think a swab test to detect the virus, which is difficult, would be widely available, said Professor John Newton, the director of health improvement.Heathrow to use only one runway as flight numbers plummetHeathrow airport, until recently the busiest two-runway airport in the world, has announced it will use only one runway for the foreseeable future, writes Simon Calder.An airport spokesperson said: “From Monday 6 April, Heathrow will be transitioning to single runway operations as a temporary measure to increase resilience and safety for colleagues, passengers and cargo..“Under this\u0026nbspnew operation, we will alternate\u0026nbspwhich runway we use on a weekly basis and publish a new\u0026nbspalternation schedule that will continue to provide local communities with respite periods.Although we are seeing significantly fewer flights at the moment, Heathrow will remain open so that we can continue to play a crucial role in helping to secure vital medical goods and food for the nation during this unprecedented epidemic.”In normal times, nearly 1,300 flights a day use Heathrow – of which slightly more than half are operated by British Airways.\u0026nbspToday BA expects to operate around 60 arrivals and departures.Second wave \u0027possible but not inevitable\u0027A second wave of the virus was possible but by no means inevitable, said\u0026nbspNHS England national medical director Stephen Powis.Avoiding a fresh one was the focus of the scientific community, he added.Hancock praises Clap for our carersMr Hancock praised the Clap for our carers event that showed appreciation for NHS staff, which is also happening again tonight.So many of us felt so emotional when that happened, he said.\u0026nbspNHS England national medical director Stephen Powis added that it was important that the NHS thanked the public for social distancing, acknowledging it was hard particularly for the elderly and the vulnerable.\u0026nbspMinisters \u0027confident\u0027 of medicines supply\u0026nbspMr Hancock said the government was currently confident that the UK had the supply of medicines needed.We have a very detailed plan for making sure that we have the full supply of medicines, including the ones that you mention, sedatives and all the medicines needed for those who have Covid-19 and people being ventilated, he said.We probably have one of the strongest understandings of the supply chain of anywhere in the world because of the preparations we did for a no-deal Brexit, and we keep them constantly under review.In fact, I took a meeting on this question today. So whilst we, of course with the lockdowns around the world, we are highly vigilant, we are currently confident that we have the supplies of medicines that are needed.Five-step plan to increase testingMatt Hancock\u0027s five pillars to move from 10,000 tests a day to 100,000 are:Swab testing in Public Health England and NHS labs\u0026nbspUsing commercial partners, including universities and private businesses, to establish more swab testing\u0026nbspIntroducing antibody blood tests to determine whether people have had Covid-19\u0026nbspSurveillance to determine the rate of infection and how it is spreading across the country\u0026nbspBuild an at-scale diagnostics industry to reach 100,000 tests by end of April.Every frontline NHS worker will get tests, Hancock pledgesMr Hancock\u0026nbspsaid he would seek to ensure every frontline NHS worker and their families would get tests, starting with those working in critical care, then the rest of the NHS, followed by care workers.Pressed on a date when it would happen, he could not give a firm date by which it would happen but said the aim was as soon as we can, saying he did not want to over-promise.The priority was swab tests, said\u0026nbspNHS England national medical director Stephen Powis.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPharmaceutical firms \u0027to build diagnostics industry\u0027 for 100,000 daily testsPharmaceutical giants such as GSK and AstraZeneca were working with diagnostics industries to build a diagnostics industry\u0026nbspat scale, Mr Hancock said.He set a goal of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month, saying he was determined to achieve it.We are in the midst of a war against an invisible enemy, he said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The antibody levels of the rodents vaccinated against Covid-19 “seem to be following the same trend,” according to the researchers.The team\u0026nbspfound the\u0026nbspCovid-19 microneedle vaccine maintained\u0026nbspits potency even after being sterilised with gamma radiation, an important step in making the drug suitable for use in humans.Testing in patients\u0026nbspwould “typically require at least a year and probably longer”, Prof Falo said.\u0026nbspBut he added: “This particular situation is different from anything we’ve ever seen, so we don’t know how long the clinical development process will take. Recently announced revisions to the normal processes suggest we may be able to advance this faster.”Scientists in Australia announced on Thursday they had begun testing another potential Covid-19 vaccine on ferrets, with a team at the University of\u0026nbspOxford set to trial the same drug on humans in the next few weeks.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

People who previously struggled with universal credit continue to do so. Rough sleepers and sofa surfers continue to live without shelter. Services that once offered support have shuttered to protect workers, while people are burning through their kitchen cupboards faster than usual because they are stuck inside.\u0026nbspIn short, many of those who have needed to use food banks in the past, those who are not among the government’s 1.5 million most at-risk people and will not be able to call on its swelling volunteer service for support, still need help.\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign aims to help give these people the support they need. Click here for ways you can help.And here are five things you might not have considered to help you to support your community’s food bank.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA common misconception is that food banks exist to offer the bare minimum – but to do so would be to completely undermine what food can give us in our day to day lives. We don’t only eat for sustenance – we do it for pleasure, to access our cultures, to engage in tradition. Food is central to the human experience, and for millennia has been key to how we experience love and affection.How to support our campaignSo ultimately think about what is going to taste good. Of course you can pick up staples that will be warmly received, but you can also donate things that get you excited, and share that excitement with someone else.Take, for example, Easter eggs. They may not be a matter of life or death, but by donating them you can give a parent the chance to treat their child, and a child the ability to engage in a communal tradition they might have been left out of. You are not just handing out subsistence, but a moment of dignity and joy for a family – and all it took was a bit of chocolate.It’s not just foodFood banks have never been just about food. Poverty is about choices – do you buy something to eat, or put money on the meter to keep the electricity running? Do you really need the heating on, or can you hold out? Will you be hungry now, or hungry later?\u0026nbspAt their most fundamental level, food banks are about a community pulling together and trying to resolve those conflicts – so when you think of donating, empathy is key. On one side of the spectrum, this means not just dredging mystery tins from the back of your cupboard – if you didn’t want to eat it over the last two years, chances are no one else will either. On the other, it’s about thinking of the groceries you couldn’t live without – be that food or something else.In the early days of the UK epidemic, among the first things to be stockpiled were hygiene products – sanitary towels, hand wash, toilet roll. If you didn’t have the ability to bulk buy, or the spare funds to travel from shop to shop by car or public transport, you were stuck. Donating bathroom products means people who use the service don’t have to choose between hunger and hygiene.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe range of reasons people visit food banks is vast, reflecting many of the social issues seen across the country, from universal credit delays to limited post-prison rehabilitation systems, rising rents and jobs that simply do not pay enough to allow for survival.\u0026nbspBut helping rough sleepers and sofa surfers out represents a unique challenge for food banks – particularly those who do not have access to kitchens and so are less likely to feel the benefit of, say, the bag of dry pasta many would receive. While volunteers will build a parcel that helps as much as possible, you can go a step further by putting together boxes of much-needed items that can be handed straight over as is.\u0026nbspAsk if your local service is interested, then get a few shoeboxes and add things that might prove useful – like socks and underwear, first aid kits, compact waterproofs, or toothbrushes and paste. Once again as much as you are donating a small box of odds and ends, you are also handing over dignity, and the tools people need to look after themselves.\u0026nbspBags of bagsFood banks across the country have had to make drastic changes to how they operate due to the virus – while volunteers may have a few contingency plans up their sleeves to keep services running, readying for a global pandemic was not among them.What has followed has been a herculean effort to organise outright change in a matter of days. Entire delivery systems have been dreamt up out of thin air, while the elderly and at risk who make up much of the volunteer base have been sent home.\u0026nbspFood banks strained as volunteers isolate and demand surgesFood banks have never been more needed, or closer to collapseFood banks in crisis as coronvirus panic buying leaves families hungryFood banks are under threat – the government has to step inUnited and City make joint food bank donation to fight coronavirusOperations have also been streamlined to feed as many people as possible, as hygienically as can be achieved. And as every service user’s food is bagged up and handed over, a small mountain of plastic bags are being deployed.So, bizarrely enough, in this time of national crisis, that bag of shopping bags that you and every other UK resident has been keeping in the corner of their kitchen or under their sink for years might finally serve a purpose. After all that time of being stored and neglected after trips to the supermarket, they could be put to use in ensuring social distancing.\u0026nbspAsk your local food bank if they could use them – but if you can go a step further and also feel a little apprehensive about contributing to the impact of plastic on the planet, consider handing over canvas bags instead. There are so many feelings wrapped into asking for help – and when you’ve been let down by the world around you time and time again, one that’s likely to come up is shame.\u0026nbspVolunteers work hard to try to mitigate that – and make the experience about support and community, but it’s easy to feel self-conscious walking away from a food bank and onto the high street with an array of clearly worn and mismatched carrier bags in your hands. A canvas bag, while sturdier, is also more discreet.Possibly the most useful thing you can do for your local food bank is among the easiest – ask what they need. While the Trussell Trust, the nation’s largest food bank charity, helps to set up and support sites, the inidual operation in your region sets its own rules and runs its own show. Others run via other charities or completely independently.\u0026nbspSo check out their tweets to see what they are appealing for, or send them an email to check what they are after, or give them a call and offer up a few hours a week to stack some tins (particularly if you are young, physically fit and don’t mind lugging around crates of produce).\u0026nbspReaching out, at every level, is fundamental to what food banks are. In reaching out you will get the satisfaction that comes from rallying around your community at a time where we’ve perhaps never been more isolated. What the person who comes to ask for food will get, from your contribution combined with others in your area coming together, is help when it’s possible no one else can.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“There isn’t anything definitively in the legislation that talks about whether people can get in a car to drive to a place and do their exercise.”Guidance issued to officers by the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) and College of Police urged them to “use your judgement and common sense”.It added: “People will want to exercise locally and may need to travel to do so —\u0026nbspwe don’t want the public sanctioned for travelling a reasonable distance to exercise. Road checks on every vehicle is equally disproportionate.”A legal firm routinely instructed\u0026nbspby police forces, 5 Essex Court, said in its own guidance that “there is no requirement that physical exercise must be carried out in the immediate vicinity of the home”.Leaving your homeBefore the lockdown was announced, Boris Johnson called for people to avoid non-essential travel, but the law does not define the phrase.Instead, it states that: “During the emergency period, no person may leave the place where they are living without reasonable excuse.”The restriction does not apply to homeless people, or those —\u0026nbspsuch as domestic violence or child abuse victims —\u0026nbspwho leave home to avoid injury or “escape the risk of harm”.Police told to arrest public for breaking lockdown as ‘last resort’The “place where they are living” includes gardens, yards, passages, stairways, garages and outhouses.The law provides a long list of “reasonable excuses”, which is not exhaustive.If someone is challenged by the police, they can provide any reason for being outside that will be considered on a case-by-case basis.The examples given in the legislation include obtaining “basic necessities”, including food and medical supplies for the household, or for vulnerable people.You can also obtain money, take exercise, seek medical assistance, provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person, donate blood, attend a funeral, go to court or access public services like schools and welfare.The law says people may travel for work or volunteering “where it is not reasonably possible for that person to work, or to provide those services, from the place where they are living”.Children are allowed to travel or be transported between the homes of separated parents or s.The law also allows people to “move house where reasonably necessary”.The law has enforced the closure of numerous shops that are deemed non-essential, such as clothing retailers.But —\u0026nbspdespite isolated reports of shops being told not to sell Easter eggs by council officers —\u0026nbspthere is no legal restriction on what remaining shops can sell.Although the law describes “obtaining basic necessities” as a reason to leave home, police leaders have not expressed an intention to check what people are buying.The law bans public gatherings of more than two people, except in specific circumstances.Such gatherings are not illegal when the people are “members of the same household”, i.e. a family that lives together, cohabiting couples or housemates.Gatherings are also permitted if they are “essential for work purposes”, to provide care to a vulnerable person, emergency assistance, take part in legal proceedings, attend a funeral or where “reasonably necessary”, such as when moving house.The law has forced the closure of pubs, restaurants, cafes, gyms, cinemas, clubs, museums, spas, betting shops and other businesses that are deemed non-essential and bring people together in a way that could spread the virus.Food retailers, off licences, pharmacies, newsagents, homeware and hardware shops, petrol stations and vehicle repair services are allowed to remain open.Also allowed to continue work are taxi and vehicle hire businesses, banks, post offices, funeral directors, laundrettes and dry cleaners, dentists, opticians and other health-related services.Veterinary surgeons and pet shops have not been forced to close.Restaurants and pubs are able to operate as takeaways as long as no one eats or drinks on the premises, and shops are allowed to run delivery services.Police and local councils can enforce closures with prohibition notices and fines.The Welsh law additionally states that retailers should take “all reasonable measures to ensure that a distance of two metres is maintained between any person on the business premises”.Police leaders have instructed officers to use fines and arrests as a “last resort” and first encourage members of the public to follow restrictions on movement and gatherings voluntarily.“We should reserve enforcement only for iniduals who have not responded to engage, explain, and encourage, where public health is at risk,” official guidance states.But there are two laws enabling police to arrest people for coronavirus-related offences –\u0026nbspthe Coronavirus Act 2020 and Health Protection Regulations 2020.Woman fined £660 for failing to give police name or reasons for travelThe first law gives police the power to direct any “potentially infected person” to go home, to a medical facility or to a testing location.Under schedule 21 of the Coronavirus Act 2020, it is illegal to fail to comply with the instructions of police officers without reasonable excuse, or obstruct them in the course of their duties.Offences can be punished by fines of up to £1,000 on summary conviction in a magistrates’ court.Most provisions of the Coronavirus Act 2020 will expire after two years, but it may be reviewed, extended or changed by parliament.The separate Health Protection Regulations 2020 came into force in England on 26 March and enforce the terms of the lockdown.The law – which will expire in six months – allows police to instruct people violating it to go home, leave an area or disperse, and to ensure parents stop their children from breaking the rules.Police given power to arrest people for breaking coronavirus rulesIt is an offence to violate restrictions on businesses, movement and gatherings without “reasonable excuse”, fail to comply with police instructions or to obstruct officials enforcing the measures.Any adults who commit an offence under the new regulations can be handed £60 fines, reduced to £30 if payment is made within two weeks.But if anyone has been fined for breaking the coronavirus lockdown before, the fine will be doubled to a maximum of £960.People will not be convicted of an offence if they pay the money within 28 days, after which enforcement action will start.“Iniduals who do not pay a fixed penalty notice under the regulations could be taken to court, with magistrates able to impose unlimited fines,” a Home Office spokesperson said.“If an inidual continues to refuse to comply, they will be acting unlawfully, and the police may arrest them where deemed proportionate and necessary.“However, in the first instance the police will always apply their common sense and discretion.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.\u0026nbsp“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.\u0026nbsp“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

where the killer bug originated in Wuhan - are all working to prevent further deaths, with tests on animals already underway.But so far, a cure to coronavirus is no closer.The short answer is no - theres no preventative vaccine for Covid- at the moment.But scientists across the globe are racing to find a jab to stop the spread and treat the sick.The first human volunteers were injected with an experimental jab in Seattle in mid March.Prof Robin Shattock, head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London, said further human trials could begin in coming months with testing on mice currently looking promising.He told Independent: Currently we have a prototype vaccine in animal models where the early results are encouraging.We are hoping to progress to clinical testing by the summer depending on obtaining sufficient funds for the next stage.Another potential vaccine is being developed by cigarette manufacturer British American Tobacco .The Benson and Hedges maker said on April  it could produce between  to  million doses per week by Junetesting goes well but it will need support from government agencies.The London-listed company says it will begin clinical trials on humans soon and is currently running pre-clinical tests.The treatment is being developed by the companys bio-health ision, Kentucky BioProcessing .KBP previously come up with a drug to combat Ebola.It claims to have found an antibody that appears to fight COVID-, using genetically modied tobacco plants, but needs US drug authorities to fast-track permissions.US drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc is testing an experimental Ebola antiviral therapy, remdesivir, on patients with coronavirus in China and Japan - with positive signs so far.In Wuhan where the virus outbreak began, Chinas Changjiang Daily reported that researchers at Zhejiang University have found that drugs Abidol and Darunavir can inhibit the virus in vitro cell experiments.And scientists in Australia have developed a lab-grown version of the virus, a major step toward creating a vaccine.Meanwhile, over in Germany, CureVac are also working on a vaccine, with majority investor and owner of football club Hoffenheim - Dietmar Hopp - has revealed that a breakthrough could be made in the next six to seven months.Talking to Sport, he said: It has to be tested first with animals then with human beings.But I think it could be available in autumn at the time when possibly the next wave of infections will come.Hopp, having already gained headlines for protests in football stadiums, revealed that the vaccine will not be privatised after German reports claimed US President Donald Trump was looking to secure some of the scientists working on the project.Researchers, like Dr Broderick, and Yuen Kwok-yung, from the University of Hong Kong, predict that the fully formed and licensed vaccine will be available from early summer but it will still take at least one year evenexpedited.”The news comes as the global research community steps up its efforts to halt the fatal epidemic.Teams around the world are working on their own vaccines, a process that typically takes at least a decade.British-America Tobaccos scientic research director Dr David O’Reilly said vaccine development was challenging and complex work, but he believes the company has made a signicant break-through with its tobacco plant technology .Researchers in Australia revealed they had successfully synthesised the virus in the laboratory, using a sample from an infected patient.The sequencing and publication by Chinese scientists of the viral genome in only a few days, compared to the five months it took during the  Sars outbreak, is considered to be a game-changer.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: The UK is one of the first countries to have developed a world-leading test for the new coronavirus.It has similar symptoms to the common cold, making it tricky to identy early.The NHS states the key symptoms are:Doctors may order laboratory tests on respiratory specimens and serum, part of your blood, to detect human coronaviruses.The testing is more likelyyou are suspected of having Mers .The UK government has bought . million antibody home testing kits to ensure more people are tested quickly and simply without having to leave home.On March , , the government announced the tests would soon be available to the masses, including NHS workers.In a press briefing, the government said they would provide Brits with home testing kits, with finger-prick kits that will be available from Amazon and Boots.Patients in hospital are quarantined and treated for their symptoms to try and help their bodies fight off the virus and prevent it spreading.In cases exhibiting pneumonia, around  per cent, patients are given oxygen and sometimes a ventilator.If their lungs become too inflamed then doctors work to relieve the pressure on other organs.In less severe cases patients are given a drip for dehydration or ibuprofen for pain relief while the body fights the infection.These treatments are reportedly effective for the most part.There are currently unveried theories that HIV medication could work too as it allegedly did with the  Sars virus, but it is only suggested for last-ditch compassionate use for extreme cases of coronavirus.Other than treatment, detection, sanitation and quarantine measures are being used to restrict the spread of the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"free paper delivery 12 weeks","story":"This means no one has to miss out on their favourite daily read.Simply head online to delivermynewspaper then search your postcode and choose your local newsagent.Select “The Sun” and let us know how often you would like to receive your newspaper.Finally, fill in your details and click “Send My Vouchers”.Vouchers for  weeks of free delivery will be posted to your address.Take these vouchers with you to your chosen newsagent to claim your free -week delivery.Alternatively, you can get your free delivery vouchers by calling us directly on   .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was the apex of collective euphoria in a unique football season for this club.A month has passed since that match, so the timing is pertinent.The aggregation of thousands of people, centimetres from each other, engaging in manestations of euphoria like hugging, shouting, all of that could’ve favoured viral reciprocation.I have to imagine many didn’t want to miss that gamethey had tickets, eventhey felt a slight fever.With hindsight, it was madness to play with a crowd present, but at the time things weren’t clear enough. It’d be unthinkable now.Valencia have announced  per cent of their squad and staff tested positive for coronavirus, linking it to that trip to Milan.And, so far Atalanta goalkeeper Marco Sportiello has tested positive for the deadly bug leading to the entire squad being quarantined.The area around Bergamo went into lockdown just four days after the game as the number of cases soared.Bergamo mayor Giorgio Gori has labelled the clash a “biological bomb” and says he believes it caused the spread of the virus in Europe.He is quoted in Spanish paper Marca as saying: “The match was a biological bomb. At that time we did not know what was happening.“If the virus was already circulating, the forty thousand fans who went to San Siro were infected.“No one knew that the virus was already circulating among us.“Many watched the game in groups and there were lots of contact [between fans] that night.“The virus passed from one person to another.”Prof Le Foche, who works in Rome, said it would now be unthinkable to have such an event with thousands of people attending given how contagious the virus is.He said: At the time the match was played there was still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the virus.What we didnt know was just how contagious it was but obviously today we know how quickly the virus can spread.Today it would be unthinkable to hold such a large event and thats why everything has stopped.To receive our Covid- newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The -year-old commander knows all too well what le is like on lockdown.He spent a year and a half living in a tiny tin can in close proximity to his crew.And he has some good tips for not going stir crazy.Obviously the space station astronauts had a lot of work and experiments to do, but that did not take up all of their time. And like the rest of us, they needed to keep busy.Scott has lots of common-sense advice for coping with being cooped up.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.First of all, we need to have a routine. We have to make sure we get up at the same time every morning and that we get washed and dressed and make our beds. We also need a regular bedtime.Scott says you have to get outside at least once a day — we can do that on earth — while also folowing the rules.You need to schedule times to talk to family and friends and have proper meal times.Exercise is vital. Our very own spaceman, Tim Peake, trained and completed a marathon on a running machine when he was part of the crew on the Space Station.Not all of us are fit enough to run -odd miles, but we can use this time to improve stamina and energy levels. I’m still doing my exercise classes with instructor Maxine Jones on her YouTube channel, and I will be starting virtual yoga with my daughter Rosie, who is in Singapore.I was surprised to learn Scott took actual books, not ebooks, into space.But he said holding a real book in his hands meant he could become completely absorbed, and concentration was not interrupted by messages pinging on his iPad.One of the most interesting things he said was to keep a journal of these strange times.It is more than just jotting down what you got up to that day. You need to go deeper and describe your hopes, fears and state of mind, and also what you hope to achieve when this is all over.One of the things Scott valued most during his long stint in space was video calls with family and friends. And he says one of the silver linings of this crisis is time to reconnect with loved ones.I know exactly what he means. I have been spending hours in WhatsApp chats with Rosie, my best friend Joyce, who is in lockdown in Spain, and my mum in East Kilbride.We chat about everythingand it lts my spirits. Scott’s other sensible advice is to get your information from the experts — and he advises against relying on the internet.He is right. Social media is stuffed with misinformed people and mad conspiracy ­theories.I was shocked to realise how some teens don’t watch any news outlets or read newspapers. They get their “news” from Facebook.They also think they are invincible, which is why we saw those packed beaches and parks this time last week.This was partly because they were unaware of the need for “social distancing” but also because they think it won’t happen to them.But Scott’s most important message to all of us is about working together.“All people are inescapably connected and the more we can come together to solve our problems, the better off we will be.“I’ve seen humans work together to prevail over the toughest challenges imaginable, and I know we can prevail over this one,we all do our part and work together as a team.”Well, I would urge you all to listen to Scott.If we can put a man on the moon then we can beat this awful virus. It won’t be easy but I have faith in science.And as long as we obey the rules, and make some sacrices, we WILL overcome.NO matter what you think of him, it would be churlish not to wish Boris Johnson a speedy recovery.But my sympathies are with Carrie Symonds, who is due to give birth in three months. She’s in isolation at a time when she needs his support.My thoughts are with all expectant parents now, bringing babies into a world we barely recognise and unable to be together in the delivery room. It will be bittersweet for all of them.ONE part of the world untouched by Covid- is my spiritual homeland of Antarctica.I visited the great white wilderness three years ago and cannot wait to .Aside from astronauts, the men and women who man the science bases in Antarctica – particularly the station at the South Pole – are well used to being in isolation while living on top of one another.Which is exactly what most of us are doing right now.Living space is limited at the Pole, and there’s no escaping the other  human beings holed up at the station for the full Antarctic winter.It’s virtually pitch black for six months and you can’t really go outside apart from short bursts of vital scientic work.Most are in danger of becoming “toasty”, which is their description of going stir-crazy.Being cramped, isolated and without proper personal boundaries and “me time” can make you cranky, short-tempered and irritated by the smallest things.In order for us all to avoid toastiness during these strange times, I’d recommend a few rules, some of which were given to me by a hardy survivor of winter at the extreme south.Have a sanctuary, evenit is just in the toilet reading your newspaper and doing the crossword.If you are feeling at the end of your tether, don’t bottle it up.Talk about your feelings and listen to what others in the house with you are saying.You might very well be annoying them as much as they are driving you up the wall.It’s early days, and this is a marathon and not a sprint.Unlike those at the Pole, at least we can still go outside and enjoy the sunshine and the heat as well as the light.I’VE got a Star Trek version of Monopoly and I’m wonderingit is too soon to bring it out from the back of the cupboard.I’ve never actually got to the end of a game of Monopoly and I reckon this might just be the only time that will ever happen.I’m also going to start watching Game Of Thrones for the first time, which should keep me going for a couple of weeks.

Then suddenly, since Monday, we are not.It’s not even been a week since the new normal for all of us is to stay put.I am guessing that for most of us, it feels like twice that. For many of us, being unable to roam freely is the stuff of nightmares.Still, although it’s been a hard week, I am feeling fortunate. Others I know are really struggling, but I’m very lucky to have a house, a job and the basics in my fridge. But my goodness, it’s boring staying at home all the time, isn’t it At the moment more or less every day is the same. I get up, do conference calls, watch the news and go to bed.But I have been trying to do a few things dferently. For fear of my muscles atrophyingI have started using an exercise video.That may sound normal to you but for me, this is staggering. It’s one from the s and is really quite funny and ­dficult at the same time.I’ve also been more studious than usual and have been doing online lectures for my master’s degree.I have put in the hours with a TV show called This Is Us.And I’ve been cooking up a storm — making increasingly inventive recipes with bits and bobs from the back of the store cupboard because the idea of getting a supermarket delivery slot feels like a fantasy so I have not even bothered to try. I cook whatever my corner shop has in stock, which sadly is not a lot.I know many supermarkets are prioritising elderly and vulnerable shoppers, which is right and proper. And I really hope that the people who are hoarding and stockpiling out of fear soon realise that they don’t need to do that.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Friends who work in the food ­industry have repeatedly told me there is no issue with supply.Especiallypeople continue to go to their local shops, which should still be stocked — and which need their custom.I am nine days into my -day self-isolating as I am still waiting to see my dad, who is recovering from cancer.And, like many others, I’m focused on the importance of being absolutely certain I am ­infection-free before I even think of going to see him and my mum.So really, I’m just sitting it out. But gosh, it’s tedious.One of the biggest changes for me is not being able to go out or see my friends. But on Friday night we had a Skype party. We all got out a bottle of wine, and I even washed my hair before we had a laugh.We are also playing the game Psych — which is great fun and played on your mobile with your mates.It’s made me realise how many of the things I blithely took for granted as being my inalienable right have changed — literally overnight.And I don’t know whether it’s a good or bad thing that my kids aren’t home with me. I’m pretty sure my daughter has already had coronavirus but happily she seems fine now.But I obviously can’t see her other than on video phone as I am isolating. And boy, do I miss her.My son, meanwhile, is with his housemates in Buckingham. They seem fine — working out in their garden gym, making meals together and playing Xbox. In fact, it’s just another day for him.I know there are people reading this who are genuinely struggling and having a seriously hard time with being isolated, who are worried about loss of income, about elderly or vulnerable relatives, or who are stuck at home with ­dficult or even violent people.It is hard to reflect on anything when we are in the middle of it.We have to focus on getting through a day at a time knowing there will be plenty of time to learn lessons when this has passed.We’ll no doubt start from the basics, like being hyper-vigilant about which animals enter the food chain, scrupulous hand-washing and reassessing our attitude towards travel — something we’ve all taken for granted for so long.We will also focus on building the NHS back up. Just as we built nuclear deterrents to protect ourselves against war, we have to protect ourselves from the ious viruses that we now know are, increasingly, out there.Yes, the important thing is the here and now. We’ve seen unprecedented events this week alone, with the PM Boris Johnson,Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty all self-isolating after either testing positive or showing symptoms of the virus.But what is vital is the long-term strategy to fight another attack like this in the future.And in the meantime, apart from feeling a bit cooped up, all in all I am pretty much doing OK with self-isolating.Apart from one thing — I can’t find any hair dye to cover my grey hair, for love nor money. Now that really is a nightmare.ASbeing stuck at home wasn’t hard enough, sports fans are having to get through this time without any football.Now that’s what I call adding insult to injury.As fans will already know, all football has been postponed until April . But behind the scenes, all football clubs, including mine, are doing whatever it takes to ensure the season finishes.I think everyone understands that our priority has to be the safety and good health of our players and the fans. So, while matches are not being played, players are doing all they can to stay fit and well so they are ready whenever it’s time to resume games.Meanwhile, the stadiums, training grounds and offices are all shut.Then, after April , we hope matches can recommence, behind closed doorsrequired.In the meantime, it’s a waiting game. So here’s hoping you’ve got some old Match Of The Day shows lined up to while away your time.ONE thing about us all having to stay at home is that it’s giving celebrities nowhere to hide in terms of what they have got to offer the world.They are on their own at home, with nothing much to do, just like us.Some – Joe Wicks teaching PE to the nation’s primary school kids every morning, Carol Vorderman holding online maths classes or Richard E Grant reading from the script of Withnail And I – are trying hard to provide the nation with useful entertainment.And then there are others. Instagram is also peppered with images of reality TV and soap stars in extremely scanty underwear.Without the props of stylists, red carpets and paparazzi shots, we see them for what they really are.Human beings, just like us.AS a week of firsts comes to a close, athletes and sports fans alike were further disappointed by the announcement that the Olympics have been postponed.Something that only a few weeks ago would have seemed unimaginable now feels, clearly, like the only sensible thing to do.Apart from the logistics involved with quarantine and uncertainty about travel restrictions, some athletes cannot train while some can, which, when the integrity of the sport is at stake, is fundamentally unfair.ANYONE  bored  With This Is Us my current favourite thing to watch, I’ve compiled a list of some other fab shows, just in case you’ve finished Succession and need some inspiration.Here goes – The Crown, Ozark, Luther, Line Of Duty, Sense, Grace And Frankie, Schitt’s Creek, Sex Education, Messiah, Spinning Out, Unbelievable and Mum.I WAS so moved by the nation overriding the old stf upper lip mentality to stand on their doorsteps to give NHS workers a round of applause on Thursday night.And then I read a tweet from a nurse saying that literally as the nation were clapping, she had received an email from her employers advising her not to travel to work in unorm or display her work ID.This is because some people have been mugged for these items and the very scant privilege – like an early supermarket slot – that they bring.Come on, people – sort it out. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I went above and beyond with the coronavirus, not just washing my hands  or  times a day until they were red raw but boiling my gloves as well.I took them off first, obviously, and even photographed the act, as I was aware this behaviour was a little “out there”.But, like the committed hypochondriac I am, I figured the ridicule was worth enduring so long as it provided one further line of defence against the invisible enemy which has us all surrounded.The glove thing seemed to be working as well, right up until the time it wasn’t. And, on Sunday, March , I very suddenly became one of those symptom lists you read about.Head in a “vice-like grip”  Check. Whole body feeling like it’s been in a car crash  Yes, and the bag didn’t inflate. Feverish  Oh boy, yes.  Chills  They’re multiplying.There was the cough as well. A textbook dry, intermittent hack that’s had its moments but never really amounted to much and has left me in a grey area, medically speaking.Testing has been out of the question, so to this day I still don’t knowI’ve had coronavirus or just something  horrible. The advice from Jake at  was unequivocal, though — “self-isolation” — and the response from everyone  was almost exactly the same.“Ha ha. Not much dferent for you then.”Ha ha. Indeed not.They mean no harm, bless them. It’s the classic British response to bad medical news. They’re reassuring themselves, as you need to do with this thing.If you think I’ve spent the past fortnight sat monitoring EastEnders for minor continuity errors, though, you haven’t had coronavirus, or anything like it.The thing does not lend itself to watching television as easily as you might think. Especially not during its first week when I was sleeping for anything up to  hours a day.The time you are awake you’re in a lot of discomfort and unwilling to be reminded of your condition, which is what television is now doing incessantly, while trying to take moral ownership of the illness as well.With endless spare time on my hands, I didn’t give up on the medium, though. I thought, in fact, it might be a good opportunity to watch some of those films I’d never got round to watching, like Get Carter, Lost In Translation and The Big Lebowski. It wasn’t.I hated all three of them, especially The Big Lebowski— not because they were without merit but because I had no appetite, zero energy and was unable to stand upright without losing my breath, while watching them.I shall now associate all three movies with misery, pain and paracetamol, for ever. About the same time I gave up on films, Sky’s Football HD channel played an even crueller trick on me, on Monday.Start to finish, it re-ran Scotland’s abortive Euro  campaign. The full chronological nightmare, starting with the - defeat in Kazakhstan, which I’d witnessed first-hand.A bullet to be dodged, surely  Reader, I watched the lot and, must confess, I found it strangely cathartic and quite funny, as well as sad.Because it reminded me of a time when there was a le that stretched so far beyond the walls of my own little home isolation unit.It provided a salutary lesson as well. Television is a fickle, uncaring beast and, with some honourable exceptions, like The Repair Shop, pretty useless at cheering you up in times of personal distress.People, on the other hand, are amazing and came up trumps during my illness.I’ve been particularly blessed with my amazing and generous East London neighbours, Fatima, Richard and David, who became aware, early on, what was happeningand reacted accordingly.Every day the buzzer would go, I’d hear footsteps beating a fairly quick retreat and by the time I’d shuffled my way to the front door, dinner would be sitting by my feet. They phoned regularly as well, to check on me.Until, on Day , after a couple of  dawns , the fever had lted, I’d had my last night-sweat, could think straight again and even a hint of an appetite ed.If this is being done for one miserable, solitary, middle-aged git who boils his gloves, I have not the slightest doubt that even more noble things are being done for all those in far greater need, and humanity will triumph over this illness, with something to spare.In the meantime, my isolation continues for now and —it so pleases the British comedy gods — no, it’s really not much dferent for me.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Quite right too.And boy, are they going to need it once they’re in the full glare of the LA-based paparazzi, who operate under far fewer legal restrictions than those based in the UK.One was caught trespassing at the school of a celebrity’s child, another scaled a wall at Jenner Aniston’s to try to get a shot of her, other stars have had their cars blocked by paps, singer Niall Horan was dragged to the floor by one at LAX airport and they’ve been known to sit outside doctor’s surgeries to snap someone famous coming out.So good luck with all that, Harry and Meghan.You’re about to realise how protected you were in the UK, both by the stricter laws and the ring of steel that shields the Royal Family.Little wonder that the rumoured bill for their personal security is estimated at around £million a year.Add in the cost of other staff, general living expenses and the £.million they said they would repay for the refurbishment of Frogmore “cottage” — now sitting empty — and it’s clear they are spending money like water with no discernible means of actually earning much to make up any shortfall.Which, once the Covid- crisis has passed, means they will be vulnerable to the attention of the super-rich.And we all know how that worked out for Prince Andrew.But perhaps the greatest concern for the Duke and Duchess of Sussexis that, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, the world’s attention is erted where and the news of their move to LA was greeted with a collective, “so what ”A mass disinterest which, when you’re “former royals for sale”, is very worrying indeed.FORMER Love Island star Maura Higgins has revealed she could get any boy she wanted at school.“I’ve always been very, very confident,” she says.Following her recent appearance on Dancing On Ice, reports that she’d split from boyfriend Curtis Pritchard were followed by rumours that she’d got a little too close to her married skating partner Alex Demetriou.But Maura claims they are “just friends”, adding: “Alex and I are so close – we’ve trained together for months . . . but that’s it.”I’m sure his we, fellow skater Carlotta Edwards, will now feel deeply reassured.Yes, it’s come to this.

How was I to know Probably because I was a Cold War kid and that’s how we all expected to go back then.Anyway, I might put my Geiger counter on Ebay.I’m asking £ or six rolls of toilet paper and some tinned tomatoes. And a Twix.And so here, in week two of the Great Lockdown, I’m pretty much useless.Unless you want to know the proportions of lead and concrete needed to minimise the radioactive fallout from a ten-megaton blast.One thing is bothering me, however.And that’s the Old Bill getting a bit overzealous in pursuit of people. Ordinary people going for a walk.A friend of mine was walking her dog in a London park when two rozzers turned up on horseback.They told her not to throw a ball for the dog.Why not  Because it might have Covid- on its fur and bump into someone .Um . . . might not the police horses also have Covid- on their fur And then there’s the Derbyshire coppers sending a drone to harass some bloke out for a walk in the Peak District. Entirely alone, not a danger to anyone.The chief plod of Derbyshire has been defending his force’s actions.Meanwhile, other forces have been naming and shaming the alleged “covidiots” on social media.I don’t think the Old Bill have ever been happier. They’re loving this.I know we must not take unnecessary journeys.I know we need to employ social distancing.People holding house parties and so on is crazy.I think the vast majority of us grasp this.But this is a tricky time. The public needs to be kept onside.We need to be able to respect our police, just as we respect the Government’s advice.Overzealous behaviour by the coppers does not help.Why should a bloke not swig from a can of beer in a park How is that more dangerous than taking your dog for a walk Why is being totally alone in a wilderness area a danger to other people There needs to be some common sense employed.Meanwhile, regarding my Geiger counter, the batteries are included.And for an extra roll of bog paper I’ll throw in the full-colour chart showing the ious symptoms of radiation poisoning.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.THE wildle is just loving this lockdown, though.I’ve never seen so many foxes, badgers and deer out where I live.It’s because people aren’t going out.And I like the thought that the animals are always there, just waiting for us humans to come a cropper.I also enjoyed the patrol of goats which have taken over the Welsh resort of Llandudno.Watch your backs, you goats.MIDDLE CLASS: Sacking the nanny and the cleaner in case they give the virus to Cressida, two, and Wolfgang, four.Growing hydroponic vegetables in the annex, enough for half a salad by next Feb.Writing letters of complaint to the board of Waitrose about the unavailability of dried black limes and manchego.Stockpiling hummus.Cycling round the local park wearing chemical warfare gear.Trying, desperately, to sell their three-bedroom cottage in North East Italy.Washing their hands every  seconds with Duchy Original Organic Fairtrade Hand Sanitiser.Trying to fit a face mask on Corbyn, their Labrador.Removing the back seats from the Range Rover for the next click and collect.Hoping to get a nice postcard from their oldest son, Oliver, who has been on his gap year in Wuhan.WORKING CLASS: Getting p***ed watching Netflix.ONE of the surprising benefactors of this virus has been the BBC.Only a couple of months ago its very existence was in doubt.The Government was planning to decriminalise non-payment of its licence fee.People were sick to the back teeth of its patent political bias.But in general, it’s done very well during this crisis.Some of its news programmes have adapted brilliantly.Not Newsnight, obvs, which is still a jabbering gripefest.But the Radio Four PM programme has been excellent.It’s presenter, Evan Davis, has an affable calmness – and he asks the right questions.Radio Five has adapted well, too – although I’d junk ALL of the sport right now.Butonly the BBC could cover politics with the same lack of bias it is now using to cover the pandemic.I SAW that a bully Builder Who Shot His Partner, Their Two Daughters, Four and Two, Their Pet Dog and Then Himself At Their £, Sussex home was described as “a nasty Piece Of Work” by a Neighbour.Sheesh!

And we’ve only been under lockdown for a week or so.But I’m slightly with Piers Morgan when he says “man up”.My dad was a working-class bloke from the North East of England.He got himself into a grammar school and had a chance to go to university. But the war stopped that.At  he was serving on a motor torpedo boat in the channel.My mum, meanwhile, was evacuated as a kid, taken away from her parents. Then her house was bombed flat.In  the Luftwaffe bombed our cities every night, death raining down.That strikes me as being real hardship.All we’ve been asked to do is sit on the sofa for a while, eating crisps.I think we can probably get through this, you know.THINGS nobody has been talking about, anywhere, since the crisis hit us.This last one is the most interesting.At times like this nobody caresyou’re black, white, brown, gay, transgender, Muslim or Jewish.Everyone grasps that we’re all in this together.If only, once this is over, we could understand that we’re STILL in all this together.And that identity politics simply causes unnecessary isions between us.ONCE this is all over the Chinese have a few questions to answer.Mainly about the degree to which their government has not been honest.Either about the start of the virus, deaths and the rate of infection right now.And what happened to the heroic Chinese doctors who tried to warn the world  At least one has disappeared.China is a devious, totalitarian and hostile country.

Bottoms up!WE have never really been as clever at shouting about our national drink as the French have about plonk.But brewing is actually a much more sophisticated process than winemaking, which leads to beer containing more flavour components than wine does.It also has the added advantage that you could live off it – at a push.It’s got just about everything you need – although you might want to throw in the odd bag of crisps for energy and pork scratchings for fat and, er, vitamins.The key with making beer at home is sanitising all your equipment, but basically you’re looking at the following procedure.CIDER is the easiest drink to make of all and my absolute favourite.There are countless dferent recipes but all you really need is apples.You can’t go wrong because the juice ferments all on its own through naturally occurring yeasts on the apple skins and in the air.Orchards are enchanting places.The apple trees on my farm are just coming in to blossom, traditionally the signal that the cider from last year’s apple crop is ready.Butyou can get your hands on apples, you can start whenever you like – and as long as everything is scrupulously clean it is drinkable at all stages of the fermentation process.I really like it at about two weeks, when it’s just starting to go fizzy but before the alcohol has had time to develop. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It doesnt mean anything.The notice we were given is worthless. What theyre trying to do is limit us so to not sell plants, and Im saying its wrong.Thats why Im tearing up this notice, because its rubbish. The issue is that the council agreed that were a hardware store and can sell hardware equipment, theyre trying to limit us to that.The frustrated businessman said the closure would see £million of plants and stock will be dumped in landfill - while supermarkets continue to sell the same items.He told Devon Live: We are desperately trying to avoid the business going bankrupt and having to lay off  employees.It seems to be one rule for supermarkets and other large national chain stores and one rule for Plants Galore - no consistency or fairness being applied.I want the council to explain why a number of retailers are not being given prohibition notices like us as they are selling plants. At our Exeter store we are just  metres from Aldi supermarket where  trolleys of garden plants are selling in their car park.It cannot be fair that we are prohibited from selling these products while the local authority continue to allow other retailers to sell identical products on our doorstep.We cannot understand why we are alone in receiving a prohibition notice while the council simply ignores other retailers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I dont think it was even that hard to persuade Harry.Harry would do anything she wanted even when she was just a USA actress. She then was able to extend her circle thanks to their relationship and bring names like Oprah and Serena Williams to their wedding.He was smitten and star struck over the whole thing. I don’t think she had to twist his arm to move to Hollywood.The shock move to LA has been dubbed Megxit  and has “stunned and horried” members of the Royal Family.They believed that Harry, , and Meghan, , would consider ing to Britain to help the royal family on the national effort to battle to coronavirus outbreak.The growing health crisis, has seen Prince Charles, , test positive for Covid- and The Queen, , and ailing Prince Philip, , put into self-isolation.News of the bombshell move came last week as US entertainment giant Disney pushed ahead with the release of a charity film about elephants, for which Meghan provides the voiceover.The deal is believed to have been done after Harry cornered the company’s boss Bob Iger at the premiere of The Lion King in London last year.But the friend, who became estranged from Meghan several years ago, said she was not surprised the couple speeded up their move to LA instead of ing to the UK to join the royal family.“They wasnt really ever a consideration for her, it’s been obvious from the start,” the LA-based former pal said.“Her relationship to that family seemed to be dependent on her freedom to have a ‘role’ that she felt was big enough for her.“She wanted it her way, and she wanted it quickly – she was never wanted to change the timeline for them.“These stories of security issues, border closure or taxes in Canada are a convenient way of them putting their plan into action.“The timing has also worked out pretty well with the release of her first project,” she added, referring to the Disney+ documentary Elephant.According to the confidante, Meghan will be “very pleased” after persuading Prince Harry to move their lives to her hometown at such breakneck pace.“Anyone who knows her knew this is where it was headed as soon as she saw she wasnt happy with how things were going in the UK,” the source said“Everything is negotiable for her and when things are not in her favor, she is prepared to cut her losses.“Now she is back home, near her mom, her friends and her PR team. She doesnt have to ask for permission from the royal family in how she chooses to live her le and she can acquire income in all sorts of fields.“She is very pleased, I’m sure. In just a couple of years she has made it back as a big fish to the place where she previously hadnt been such a well known face.“Shell be happy to be back in the Soho House atmosphere, taking meetings and reunited with her avocado toasts and runs on the beach.“But I imagine she will keep her circles ever more exclusive, hosting dinners at her house where she can have a controlled environment and enjoying that people will be wanting access to her le.“In LA she can use her royal fame without any constraints of tradition. Her celebrity meter is very high now and there is no better place for it than Hollywood.“She can make sure that the relationships she keeps are really worthwhile.But she thinks the circumstances might work in Harry’s favor and, despite what some people think, he may well enjoy the new lestyle.“I think Harry will like the change of scenery and the kind of attention they will be getting,” said the source.“It will also be easier on him than it was on her first husband. When she was with Trevor , she was very much up and coming and incredibly busy.“She wanted every opportunity for a red carpet, a magazine shoot, a photograph at an event. He had to deal with sharing her with that side of the job.“But now that they are so high profile, at least for now, she won’t be needing to do all that. Harry wont have to deal with that.“And with Archie being so young still, they will probably keep a tight family unit and try to be lowkey.She added: “Her mom will also bring some normality to their le, I would expect.”The Sussexes left the £.million mansion they were borrowing in Vancouver and took a flight out of the city shortly before US President Donald Trump and Canadian PM Justin Trudeau closed the border between their countries.They are due to step down as senior royals on Wednesday.They are also set to announce their new brand and charity on Instagram, The Sun revealed.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But health experts have warned that it may take  days before an immunity test will work and that immunity may not last forever. It came as Health Secretary Matt Hancock pledged to ramp up the number of tests - to seepeople currently have the disease - to , a day by the end of April. The government has been on the backfoot over its testing commitments for several days now failing to explain why the UK lags behind its European counterparts - testing just , a day compared to , in Germany. Today Mr Hancock said that the government was looking at an immunity certicate as a way out of the lockdown imposed on the UK in the last two weeks. He told a press conference in Downing Street: How people who have had the disease have got the antibodies and therefore have the immunity can show that and so get back as much as possible to normal le. That is an important thing that we will be doing and are looking at. But the Health Secretary said it was too early in the science of the immunity that comes from having the disease to be clear about when that might come and how it would work. He added: I wish that we could but the reason that we canapost is because the science isnapost yet advanced enough. But we have a programme of work on to understand the immunity that you get out of this, which is a global piece of work. And what you then do for people who have had the disease.  Mr Hancock, who appeared in Downing Street for the first time in a week after self isolating, said: Believe you me I have a very strong, personal interest in this one now that Iaposve been through it. Public Health Englandaposs Director of Health Improvement Professor John Newton agreed that there was still a lot of work to be done to explore how immunity to coronavirus works. He said that getting antibody tests ready was less pressing than testing to seepeople currently have covid- - partly because of the time it takes for antibodies to show up.  He said: The initial priority is for the swab tests, because those are the tests that allow the NHS to manage critically ill patients to the best they possibly can and also to allow NHS staff and other key workers to come back to work when they can. The antibody tests are ideally done  days after an infection, so in fact the requirement for the antibody test isnapost really with us yet. Both types of test are important, both are urgent, but the most urgent is the swab test so we can treat patients better and get staff back to work.  He added: The test measures your immunity and the peak of your immunity is at  days. Soyou want to tell somebody that they havenapost been infected, and theyaposre not immune, you really have to do it then to be sure.  So thataposs the point about  days. Professor Newton also explained that scientists did not yet know how immunity would work. He said that what the test measures is an antibody, so there is some immunity. But the question of whether that is enough to stop you being infected at all, or getting serious disease is something that weaposre going to need to discover as time goes on. I think we have to be optimistic that it will give some immunity, but weaposre just not quite sure how much at the moment.

Severn Trent Water said it had received , reports of sewer blockages in a fortnight - mainly due to kitchen roll. The company described its workload as much busier than usual. Scottish Water also said it had seen a high number of sewage blockages - recording , between March  and March . Garry Kirkwood, Scottish Wateraposs sewer response manager, said: This can be an extremely distressing experience for people and cause signicant damage to property. We are calling for the support of our customers to do the right thing and not contribute to avoidable sewer chokes. Welsh Water reiterated the importance of not flushing wet wipes or kitchen rollthey are affected due to the shortage of toilet paper. Steve Wilson, Welsh Wateraposs managing director of wastewater, said: While we encourage everyone to practise good hygiene to protect against coronavirus, wet wipes and kitchen roll can be hugely damaging to our sewers.  Thames Water said their engineers had removed three huge blockages from the inlet filter screens at Beddington sewage works in Croydon in just three weeks. Adrian Wallis, Beddington sewage works manager, said: Normally we only need to jet wash the inlet screens every two to three months. Last month alone we did it three times. Southern Water, Northumbrian Water and Northern Ireland Water have also recently issued pleas to residents to only flush toilet paper. Speaking of the rise in call-outs, the sewer blockages lead at Severn Trent Water, Grant Mitchell, said: We know just how worrying it is for everyone at the moment and we want to reassure our customers that weaposre working really hard to keep our essential service running.  In the last two weeks weaposve dealt with over , reports of sewer flooding or sewer blockages in our area which is much busier than normal. And weaposre seeing more and more blockages caused by kitchen roll and wipes. We know that some people are having to resort to using a whole manner of things to substitute for toilet roll at the moment, but a sewer blockage is the last thing that anyone needs right now.  So we wanted to let everyone know that kitchen roll and wipes are not designed to break down like loo roll is so please remember to bin them otherwise you could end up blocking your sewer pipes. Mr Mitchell added: On top of doing one of the most mucky jobs out there, our teams are getting asked why theyaposre out and about a lot at the moment, but we want to reassure everyone they are only doing work that is essential.

Madie, nine, and four-year-old Josh showed off the honour that was sent to parents Drew Lee and Emma Thomas from the Guinness World Records. Hope died in November  shortly after she was born and her kidneys and liver cells were donated. Drew, , said of the certicates the family received: “I actually burst into tears when I opened the letter. “It was quite an emotional moment, to me this has finalised something. “Even though Hope only lived for  minutes she is still making her mark on the world. She will never be forgotten. After I’m gone someone will look at these books and read her name.”  Emma, , added: “Receiving the letter was a bit of a shock and opening it brought tears to my eyes.” The certicates read: “The youngest organ donor is Hope Lee, of Newmarket, UK, who donated her kidneys and liver cells just  minutes after she was born on  November .” Drew and Emma found out in the early stages of pregnancy Hope had the brain condition anencephaly and would not survive. But they refused to abort her after being inspired by the story of another tiny donor. Teddy Houlston lived for just  minutes before he donated his organs in . Hope’s kidneys were given to a woman in her late s.  Despite being as small as hazelnuts, the organs grew rapidly and are now of an adult size. Josh is also going from strength to strength. Drew said: “He’s a lovely little boy, very caring and loving, he’s just so adorable. “He knows he had a little sister and can recognise her photo. He’s taken finding out about Hope really well.” Drew and Emma have always spoken in support of the Mirror’s successful campaign for the ­introduction of Max and Kiera’s Law. The couple understand a doctor from Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, who was involved with their daughter, submitted her name for the record.  Drew said: “Hope is part of history now and has left her mark on the world. In many ways we are still grieving but the world record certicates are another step towards closure.” The couple have since split. Emma still lives in Newmarket and Drew at nearby Mildenhall. Max and Keira’s Law is named after a boy who received a heart ­transplant and the girl who donated it to him. Keira Ball, from Devon, was only nine when she died in a car accident. Her dad agreed for her organs to be donated and she saved four lives, including that of Max Johnson, of ­Winsford, Cheshire. The nine-year-old had been kept alive with a mechanical pump and would have died without the transplant.

The country is still struggling to test , people a day for Covid- nationwide, weeks after the pandemic reached British shores. Meanwhile Germany is conducting , tests a day and the country has a much lower death rate than that of the UK. The World Health Organisationhas urged countries to apostest, test, testapos to try and get on top of the outbreak. On Wednesday , tests were carried out in the UK with the capacity for ,. But numbers overall remain low and yesterday No said just , frontline NHS staff, out of , in England, have been tested since the outbreak began. As of pm on Wednesday the overall number of deaths from the virus in the UK was ,. The fact that the number is currently low and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future can be explained by the following reasons. Communication breakdown aposreduces testing capacity by tens of thousandsapos A breakdown in communication between Public Health Englandand the governmentaposs animal health agency may have reduced the UKaposs testing capacity by tens of thousands per week, it has been claimed. Employees at Animal and Plant Health Agencyhave been in discussion with PHE for more than two months about supporting testing efforts, reports BuzzFeed News. The news website reports that they have seen evidence of PHE sending APHA, which tests diseases among animals, conflicting information about recruiting and training scientists. One APHA scientist told BuzzFeed News: “We’re not even getting a consistent message about what they want us to do,” adding that the miscommunication with PHE was “appalling”. aposHerd immunityapos strategy suggested by Government  As the coronavirus outbreak began to worsen in early March members of the Governmentaposs aposnudge unitapos appeared to favour a strategy of herd immunity. Dr David Halpern, a psychologist who heads the Behavioural Insights Team, said on BBC News: “There’s going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows, as we think it probably will do, where you’ll want to cocoon, you’ll want to protect those at-risk groups so that they basically don’t catch the disease and by the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity’s been achieved in the rest of the population.” To reach herd immunity, about % of the population would need to get ill and become immune, according to Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientic adviser. Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine, said: “I do worry that making plans that assume such a large proportion of the population will become infectedmay not be the very best that we can do.” Within a week the aposherd immunityapos strategy was scrapped and replaced with apossuppressionapos with social-distancing measures quickly ramped up. Speaking to BBC Newsnight former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who had earlier criticised the aposherd immunityapos strategy said: “We changed our strategy a couple of weeks ago from the herd immunity strategy to the suppression strategy.” Government pledge to perform , tests a day  On March  - roughly six weeks after the first confirmed case of Covid- in the UK - the Government pledged that , tests a day would be performed by the week after. That target was finally reached on April  when , tests were carried out. Also on March , the Government said that , tests a day would be carried out aposwithin four weeksapos. Thereaposs no indication that they will be able to reach that target but today Prof Paul Cosford of Public Health Englandsaid that testing would hit , per day imminently. Government U-turn on the importance of testing  Last week Englandaposs deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries said: There comes a point in a pandemic whenis not an appropriate intervention and that is the point where we moved. “Although we still do some contact tracing and testing, for example in high-risk areas like prisons and care homes, that is not an appropriate mechanism as we go forward.” However in a video message on Twitter on Wednesday evening, Mr Johnson said that increased screening would be how the UK defeats the coronavirus. I want to say a special word about testing, because it is so important, and as I have said for weeks and weeks, this is the way through, he said. This is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle. This is how we will defeat it in the end. At roughly the same time the prime ministeraposs video was being posted on Twitter on Wednesday night, Jonathan Van Tam, also a deputy chief medical officer, told ITVaposs Robert Peston that testing was a side issue for reducing deaths. Muddled facts on NHS frontline staff testing  On Wednesday the government said , NHS staff had been tested - despite claims more than , are off sick or self-isolating. On Thursday Downing Street claried that the testing number was in fact higher than previously said. No said there were actually two strands of testing for NHS staff - drive-through tests, which have now tested , staff, plus testing within NHS labs of frontline staff. The government claimed that this second section has tested a signicant number of NHS staff, but said the numbers will only be set out in full later on Thursday. Meanwhile, a new lab in Milton Keynes has now started taking samples from NHS staff, No claimed. Downing Street said nearly  universities, companies and research institutes agreed to lend their machines for the Milton Keynes effort and not a single institution that was asked refused”. Spare capacity to be used on NHS staff  Government ministers said on Tuesday night that they would finally start using spare capacity to test NHS staff, after even the UKaposs limited testing capacity went unfilled despite enormous demand. Itaposs understood the gap between coronavirus testing capacity and actual tests was due to a % cap on staff tests, with % reserved for patients. When medics were unable to fill the % patient quota, testing capacity went unused. With testing capacity increasing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the NHS to remove the cap, so all spare capacity can be used for staff and families from Wednesday. aposDunkirk-like effortapos needed to increase test numbers dramatically  Sir Paul Nurse, chief executive of the Francis Crick research institute - which will soon be able to conduct  Covid- tests a day - said a Dunkirk-style effort was needed to co-ordinate smaller laboratories and increase test numbers. We are a lot of little boats and the little boats can be effective, he said, referring to the evacuation of Allied troops from the beaches of the French city during World War Two. He added: The government has put some big boats, destroyers in place. Thataposs a bit more cumbersome to get working and we wish them all the luck to do that, but we little boats can contribute as well. A lack of materials and lab space  A global shortage of key chemicals called reagents is hampering the production of tests, No claimed this week. According to the British In Vitro Diagnostic Association, companies are working to meet demand, but the chemicals needed for dferent testing machines are dferent and the production complex. While reagent supply issues were sighted by Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, as a reason for the slow production of tests, this claimed was thrown into doubt on Tuesday. The Chemical Industries Association, which represents the UK’s substantial chemicals industry, told ITV that there was no shortage. What is certain however, is the fact that too little lab space has been designated for scientists to look at the tests. At first, Public Health England was only using its own eight laboratories. This has been expanded to  NHS labs, meaning  labs in total are now operational. No test is better than a bad test  Professor Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, has issued a note of caution about rushing out tests that are not ready. “One thing worse than no test is a bad test, arguing that an infected doctor or nurse ly given the all clear could spread the virus through a large portion of a hospital. Some scientists have argued that the Governmentaposs stringent guidelines when it comes to testing standards, as well as types of reagents and chemicals, needed to be relaxed. “It is holding things up,” Professor Nicola Stonehouse, a molecular virologist at Leeds University, told . “If we could get over this, we could get the testing centres up and running so much faster, and that’s got to be a good thing. How is the Government planning to recty this   Today Matt Hancock said that he would be pressing the accelerator on coronavirus testing before unveiling a five-point plan that he claimed would see the UK eventually reach , tests a day. Part of the plan is to harness the capabilities of the UK private sector. In a conference call with manufacturers, inventors and commercial developers last night, the Health Secretary asked them to urgently create a major UK diagnostic capability, in line with that in Germany.  When asked about the details of the plan, Prime Minister Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman said that following complaints of shortages, the NHS had developed a new specication for the swabs used to carry out the tests which had been validated and shared with potential manufacturers. We think that provides us with a way forward to complete hundreds of thousands of tests, he said.

People have been able to enjoy parks and outdoor spaces again after officials eased lockdown measures, including allowing people to travel in and out of the city. The city of  million people was placed into lockdown at the end of January, alongside other Chinese provinces, after the deadly virus first emerged. Residents are now starting toto work, tracked by a smartphone app that showsthey are free of symptoms. Shops and other businesses have also reopened. The outbreak began in December and has resulted in tens of millions of people being prevented from leaving their homes.

They know it#xs Tory policy and ineptitude which have put us in this position.:Too slow, too little - and lacking clarityThe Tory Government has been heavily criticised for failing to roll out mass checks for health workers and the public.Britain initially took a restrained approach to the outbreak but changed tack after modelling showed a quarter of a million people in the country could die. Prime Minister Boris Johnson later imposed more stringent measures but the government has faced widespread criticism for having too few ventilators and too little testing. In todays press conference, Matt Hancock tried to give clarity on the government#xs testing strategy after a slew of sometimes contradictory statements from ministers and officials. While Germany has been testing about , people a week, Britain has been conducting about , tests a day. The United Kingdom#xs coronavirus deaths rose  percent to , as of April . More than half of Brits think Johnson#xs government was too slow to order a lockdown, an Ipsos MORI poll showed.

But they have got to work.#xD:I still think there are reasons to be hopefulAsked during the coronavirus media briefing about whether early #xCgreen shoots#xD of recovery had finished, Professor Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, said: #xCNo, I still think there are reasons to be hopeful, as I said a couple of days ago.#xCOne of the very first reasons for that is because we do see, as I have shown you, that the public is complying with the measures that the Government have laid out to reduce social contact and to stop the spread of the transmission.#xCIf we didn#xt see that happening, then I think the answer would be no but we do see that happening and it#xs important we continue to see that happening.#xCSecondly, as Sir Patrick Vallancesaid earlier in the week, we do see early academic evidence that the transmission rate in the community may have fallen below one and that#xs important becauseit#xs the case that we are no longer passing the virus on to multiple people, so to less than one person for everybody that#xs infected, then that is additional evidence that infections are going to reduce.#xD:KEY EVENTMore than £ billion of historic NHS debt written off to help trusts fight outbreakMatt Hancock announced that #xA.billion of debt at NHS trusts across the country is being written off to help them deal with the coronavirus pandemic.The Health Secretary said he had made #xA million available for community pharmacies and that he wanted to make sure #xCevery part#xD of the health and care system is supported.Read our full reportMatt Hancock leading the press conference today:Video: Government vows , coronavirus tests a day by end of April:Emotive words from Matt Hancock - but NHS workers need better protectionMatt Hancock paid an emotional tribute to NHS staff who have lost their lives, and expressed his #xCdeepest condolences#xD to the friends and families of all coronavirus victims. #xCIf the past few weeks have shown us anything, it#xs that we are steadfast as a country in our resolve to defeat this invisible killer,#xD he said. #xCI am profoundly moved by the compassion and the commitment that we are seeing from people right across the country, and in the health and care system we have lost colleagues too. #xCDoctors, nurses, mental health professionals: they have paid the ultimate price for their service - working to care for others. #xCI just want to say this on behalf of all my colleagues in health and social care: I am awed by the dedication of colleagues on the frontline, every single person, who contributes to the running of this erse and caring institution that our nation holds so dear. #xCMany of those who have died who are from the NHS were people who came to this country to make a dference, and they did, and they#xve given their lives in sacrice, and we salute them.#xDDowning Street also faced anger over the availability of protective equipment for NHS staff.Earlier today the government admitted its coronavirus testing regime does not go far enough after days of anger at the slow progress on checks for Covid-.:Matt Hancock forced to defend prioritising testing of patients over NHS staffAt the ongoing press briefing, Hancock defended his decision to prioritise testing of patients over NHS staff and said he thought any health secretary would have done the same. He said: #xCI understand why NHS staff want tests, so they can get back to the front line, of course I do. #xCBut I took the decision that the first priority has to be the patients for whom the results of a test could be the dference in treatment that is the dference between le and death. #xCI believe anybody in my shoes would have taken the same decision.#xD Mr Hancock said there was a #xCchallenge#xD in ensuring the public could have #xCconfidence#xD in the tests being used on NHS staff.

The Secretary of State said: #xCIn one case a test that I#xm being urged to buy missed three out of four positive cases for coronavirus. #xCThat means that three-quarters of cases, that test would have given the  comfort of sending someone with coronavirus back on the wards. #xCApproving tests that don#xt work is dangerous and I will not do it.#xD:Fight this virus with everything Ive gotMatt Hancock, who has recovered from Covid- and came out of self-isolation on Thursday, said he came back #xCredoubled in my determination to fight this virus with everything I#xve got#xD. #xCAnd we will strain every sinew to defeat it once and for all. #xCAnd I will stop at nothing to make sure that frontline staff have the right equipment so that they are safe and can have the confidence they need to do their jobs.#xDBut his empassioned promises will come far too late for thousands of NHS workers left on the frontline without proper PPE, without tests, and feeling vulnerable as the Government#xs delayed response continues to receive huge criticism.:Matt Hancocks five pillar planAt today#xs press briefing, Mr Hancock said the UK lacked a large diagnostics industry so was having to build from a #xClower base#xD than the likes of Germany, which is testing at greater levels for coronavirus.

For most respiratory viruses, the best place to sample is the back of the nose, because this is where high levels of organisms gather so it is much more reliable than oral sampling. Guidance from Public Health Englandsays samples for coronavirus testing should be taken from the upper respiratory tract.Called a nasopharyngeal swab, the test requires a medical professional to insert what looks like a long cotton bud as far as itaposll go into a persons nose. After this, the sample is taken it is sent off to a laboratory for testing.  It comes as the Government announced that Brits will soon be able to conduct coronavirus antibody tests at home. The finger-pricking test will detect whether a person has had the coronavirus test before and since recovered. The availability of these tests will mean NHS workers currently self-isolating couldto workthey test positive for the antibodies.

Scientists suggest that when tested in mice, it produced antibodies specic to Covid- in quantities thought to be sufficient for neutralising the virus. The vaccine is described in a paper published in EBioMedicine, which is published by The Lancet, and is thought to be the first to be reviewed by other scientists.Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine say they were able to act quickly because they had laid the groundwork during earlier coronavirus epidemics.Co-senior author Andrea Gambotto, associate professor of surgery at the university, said: We had previous experience on Sars-CoV in  and Mers-CoV in . These two viruses, which are closely related to Sars-CoV-, teach us that a particular protein, called a spike protein, is important for inducing immunity against the virus. We knew exactly where to fight this new virus. Thataposs why itaposs important to fund vaccine research. You never know where the next pandemic will come from. The researchers say their vaccine candidate follows a more established approach compared to the experimental mRNA vaccine candidate that has entered clinical trials in Seattle.  They have called their drug PittCoVacc, short for Pittsburgh Coronavirus Vaccine, and it uses lab-made pieces of viral protein to build immunity - the same way that current flu jabs work. The researchers also used a novel approach to deliver the drug, called a microneedle array, to increase potency.  This array is a fingertip-sized patch of  tiny needles that delivers the spike protein pieces into the skin, where the immune reaction is strongest. The patch is applied like a plaster and then the needles, which are made entirely of sugar and the protein pieces, simply dissolve into the skin.  Co-senior author Louis Falo, professor and chair of dermatology at the School of Medicine and University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre, said: We developed this to build on the original scratch method used to deliver the smallpox vaccine to the skin, but as a high-tech version that is more efficient and reproducible patient to patient. And itaposs actually pretty painless - it feels kind of like Velcro. Researchers say their system can be mass produced, and once manufactured, the vaccine can sit at room temperature until it is needed, eliminating the need for refrigeration during transport or storage.

Looking back, that only makes the win all the more remarkable.For United, it was a far grander venue and harks back to the good old daysof regularly competing for big trophies.The  League Cup semi-final win over Aberdeen was my first experience of covering a big club game at Hampden. It was a great day with a huge Tangerine following rewarded with an amazing comeback victory thanks to Callum Morris and Nadir Ctci headers.Everyone has their own favourites and this stoppage is a great time to reminisce – hopefully, we won’t have to do that for too long.Uefa are due to meet via video conference today to thrash out some sort of plan for sorting how the current season ends.I’m glad to hear that’s because it’s pretty much certain their initial hopes to get club football completed by the end of June won’t be coming to fruition.August seems to be the consensus and it sounds fair enough.What I expect to come out of this virtual get-together is some sort of rational plan to sort out player contracts and technical issues like that.That’s what Uefa is there for. What I don’t expect them to do is grant the SPFL’s wishes by making tough decisions on how to end this season.I can’t help but think Neil Doncasterand SFA chief Ian Maxwellare desperate for Uefa to make a sweeping decision so they can avoid any sort of responsibility when people moan.My gut feeling is the European chiefs will have a plan to get the campaign finished in the autumn and roll straight into the new one. I would dearly love our set-up to be restructured to bigger leagues, however.After watching the  Scottish Cup Final on Sunday it made me think ‘where have all the cup finals gone’ It’s been five long years since Dundee United were last in a major cup final and  for Dundee. The end of my first season at the Tele saw the Tangerines in the Scottish Cup Final and then the League Cup showpiece a year later.It just shows how quickly things can fall apart – thankfully, both seem to be putting the pieces back together.To keep me amused I’ve been watching the Leeds United documentary on Amazon.

winners in a British International Championship match thanks to a Samuel Torrans own goal and John Taylor strike.Barret would go on to win just the one more cap for his country but wore the dark blue of Dundee with distinction  times.Born in Dundee on August ,  to Irish parents, he began his career at Dundee Harp – a club formed to try to emulate Celtic and Hibernian in providing a sporting focus for the catholic community in Scotland’s major cities.They had harboured ambitions to be the city’s top side before East End and Our Boys formed Dundee Football Club as we know it today in .In December of its first season, looking to bolster their back line, the Dee swooped for Harp keeper, Barrett.Their problems were clear for all to see as he became the fth goalkeeper the ‘Ten-bobbers’ used that season when he made his debut against Hearts on December .Barret remained at the club until the summer of  before signing for Newton Heath, now Manchester United, and went on to play against Dundee in a friendly – one of his  appearances for the Red Devils.Spells at New Brighton Tower, Manchester City and Aberdeen followed, before Barrett began to suffer from ill health, eventually passing away aged just  in .Hall of Fame inductee Longair, known as “Plum”, was a terric servant to Dundee – stretching back to the days of East End, for whom he signed in .The match against Ireland was Plum’s only cap in a career which also stopped in at Newton Heath as well as Sunderland, Burnley and Brighton United.Born in Dundee in , the centre-half would make  appearances for the Dee, scoring four goals and captaining the club in its first-ever fixture against Rangers in  – a - draw at West Craigie Park.Skippering the side is something Longair would do multiple times in his four spells until his retirement from playing in .He would go on to be the club’s trainer for their  Scottish Cup success and later become groundsman before his sad death aged just  in .It is estimated , people lined the streets for his funeral, showing the high regard in which the Dundonian public held him.Keillor was not only one of the first Dundee players to play for Scotland but also the first to score.Picking up four caps in total, the attacking talent also made  appearances for the Dark Blues, scoring  goals.Born in Dundee on October , , Keillor was brought up in Montrose and began his career with the Links Park side in .He joined the newly-formed Dundee FC in  with two Scotland caps already under his belt and, like Longair, played in the club’s first-ever match against Rangers.The outside-left was seen as a complete footballer with The Courier writing at the time that “he had a knack of rising to the big occasion”.And he did just that when Scotland hosted Wales at Dundee’s Carolina Port in , with Keillor getting his goal in a - win for the Scots.Keillor was awarded a testimonial against Celtic in , with , supporters turning up.He remained with the club until , playing at the new Dens Park alongside Longair, before ing to Montrose and hanging up his boots in .

united teammates are shining for the dundee clubs","story":"Ayr United captain Ross Docherty insists he’s not been surprised by how well his former team-mates have fared at Dundee and Dundee United.Declan McDaid joined the Dark Blues from the Honest Men last summer, with Lawrence Shankland and Liam Smith swapping Somerset Park for Tannadice.Shankland has notched  goals in  games for the Terrors and Scotland, while Smith and McDaid have been standouts for their clubs.Goal machine Shankland has particularly impressed Docherty.“It’s not been a surprise to me at all how well he’s done,” the -year-old midfielder said.“I had every confidence in him going up there at the start of the season because he’d done it for Ayr.“We were a decent team last season but he’s gone to Dundee United and they’re dominating the league.“If he gets a chance, he’s going to score and he’s maybe been getting a bit more service up there.“He’d dried up before the league stopped but they’d been struggling as a team.“His form has seen him get caps and a goal for Scotland which is amazing.“He knowshe performs he’s going to get an opportunity.“There’s been a shortage of strikers, obviously, but you can’t take it away from Lawrence.“Boys can look at him and take confidence and encouragement, even though they might not get a Scotland cap playing in the Championship.“It’s unexpected and a bit out there but,you’re going to perform well over a period of time, there’s chances out there to better yourself.”And Doc puts a large portion of Shankland’s improvement down to the -year-old getting himself into shape mentally as well as physically after joining Ayr.The former Livingston and Airdrie man added: “With any striker when they’re going through a period of good form then it’s got to be about having confidence.“That comes from doing well and what started that off was when he came in at Ayr.“He was maybe a wee bit unfit having not done much over the summer before signing for us and he was unfit the season before – he’d be the first to admit that.“His head wasn’t right so it was a number of things but he come in, got as fit as he could and he’s just in a better space.“He was like a dferent guy to the one I played against before and, once you get that, the confidence and the ability he has makes him unstoppable in the league at times.“I’m fairly close to him and he’s a bubbly character but it’s a quiet confidence.“He wouldn’t be bragging to anyone about anything or in anyone’s face.“He knows he’s good enough and that’s probably what a lot of good players miss in this league.“He’s one where,he misses a chance, he knows he’s going to go and score the next one.”Although a dferent character, Docherty believes Smith is almost as important to the Tangerines as Shankland.“I’m not surprised he’s been one of United’s most consistent players because he was the same last season at Ayr.“He came in and flew under the radar but, with two or three months to go in the season, people were starting to say ‘he’s been amazing for us’.“He did it the whole season but he sometimes goes unnoticed but that’s probably because he is such a quiet boy.“He’s a steady Eddy and he and Lawrence link up well.“They did it at Ayr but when you look at us compared to what Dundee United have in terms of budget this season I’m not surprised they’ve gone and done it again.”Docherty does admit, though, that McDaid’s transformation into a left wing-back under James McPake at Dens Park was unexpected.“I’ve seen recently they’ve been playing a -- so he’s almost been playing wing-back,” he added.“I spoke to him and, obviously, as a winger you never really want to be playing there so he was kind of laughing about it!“At the end of the day, though, it shows that he has that side of his game and will benefit him in the long run.“If people maybe two years ago, and I was probably one of them, had thought that Declan McDaid would be playing wing-back they’d have laughed.“He wasn’t as good defensively but now you can see he’s really improved there.“Whenever we’ve played them or I’ve seen them on the telly he’s been one of their best players this season.“It’s brilliant for him, the same as Lawrence and Liam, that boys from Ayr can go to these other clubs and really perform.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/DNic_Whorterbank_Signs-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"whorter bout this then residents of dundee

Contractors were meant to be already working on that but it has obviously been delayed.“Then we will wait for the permission to come in for St Mary’s Chapel so we can open it up to more people and make it a more welcoming conference room for groups to book out.” vw, px\"  The chapel is at the lower east end of the church and the works will involve creating a wheelchair ramp and improving access to the north-east entrance to the kirk.Internal stairs will also be partially removed to form an amenity space.In addition, a redundant boiler house will be removed to allow more room for guests.Planning documents, submitted by Groves Raines Architects to the council, state: “As a vision for the reuse of the empty East Kirk emerges, the re-establishment of St Mary’s Chapel as a usable space has now become a priority for the church. vw, px\"  “A key element of these works will be creating an accessible access to St Mary’s Chapel at the north-east gate and entrance, with improvements to pedestrian access to the churchyard.“The chapel has suffered from damp over the years, particularly when water had been penetrating the roof.”The trust received a cash boost of £, from the town centre fund last June and that money is being ploughed into the improvements.Arthur hopes to get more funding in place to carry out the most ambitious part of the project – the construction of a four-storey building which will house a heritage centre.He said: “We want to make St Nicholas Kirk the focal point of the city centre.“To do this, we will have a museum-type attraction showing the development of the church building over the last , years and how Aberdeen grew around it.“We will also include a cafe and a giant multi-purpose room that groups can hire.“Obviously this all depends on how much money we can generate but hopefully, all going well, we can get it done in five years.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/79F36971-5B71-4EA4-9EA1-73D4038079D7-126x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"nicola sturgeon tells employers do the right thing as scottish government drafts fresh covid 19 guidance to businesses","story":"The Scottish Government will issue fresh advice to businesses who are continuing to flout new rules around closures in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Speaking at a press conference in Edinburgh, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said more #bespoke and specic# advice will be issued to employers who are still unsure about whether to remain open or not in the wake of the covid- outbreak.It comes as the SNP leader revealed there had been a total of  coronavirus deaths in Scotland #  a rise of six # and warned Scots #it will be some time before le s to normal#.As a result of the pandemic # which has seen Scotland put in lockdown # all non-essential shops across the country have been closed, with businesses told to make their staff work from homethey can.Companies which are vital to the fight against covid- or Scotland#s #economic resilience# are being asked to remain open # but onlythey can do so in line with healthy and safety guidance surrounding covid-.Speaking in Edinburgh on Wednesday, Mrs Sturgeon started by thanking the country#s business community, adding: #The vast majority of businesses have behaved responsibly.#However she added: #I do remain concerned for some workers who have been put under unnecessary and unacceptable pressure.#She announced that the updated guidance being issued by the Scottish Government would not #seek to answer every single questions every business has# but would #set out clear principles# to employers.Mrs Sturgeon said: #Of course there will be some exceptional, nuanced or dficult cases.

In Italy, there were six or seven teams who could win everything.“I followed Roma and had a couple of Roma tops.“As I got older I looked at my collection and I had tops from all over the place, so I decided to quit collecting from other countries and just focus on the Italian ones, mainly because of the memories it brought back and because I recognised so many players.”“I never realised the number until this isolation period.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus claims 16 more lives in scotland","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe number of people in Scotland who have died from COVID- has risen to , the First Minister has announced.The coronavirus death toll rose by  on yesterday with confirmed cases now up to , from , yesterday.A total of  people are in intensive care as the virus accelerates, she said, although numbers are regarded as underestimate.In addition, she confirmed today that the popular Edinburgh Fringe Festival would not take place this summer, bringing to an end rumours it may happen on a much smaller scale.Addressing questions about the availability of ventilators in Scotland, Mrs Sturgeon said the Scottish Government #had a number# on order with overseas manufacturers.#Those orders will be delivered,they stay on track, over the period of the next number of weeks and by the summer,# she said.#It will take us to roundabout more than a thousand ventilators.

All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"schools-stay-open-certain-children-borders","story":"Some children will be able to attend school on Mondayand Tuesday, Scottish Borders Council has confirmed.Among nursery and primary-aged children, vulnerable youngsterscan attend ndashas can the childrenof key workers.But the council has said thatit is possible for a child to remain at home, then they should.The local authorityhas defined keyworkersas follows:bull NHS staff engaged in the national response to COVID- bull Health and social care staffbull Emergency servicesbull Staff working in schools and early years provisionsbull Scottish Borders Councilemployees delivering key services directly in response to COVID-.School transport will run as normal,packed lunches will be provided and children can wear their own clothes.Secondary-agedstudents will learn from home, but S students may attend schooltheir key worker parents would not like them to remain at home alone.Full details on the plans can be accessed on the councils website here."},{"url":null,"title":"cinema-pub-galashiels-ask-help-shutdown","story":"The cinema in Galashiels has teamed up with a pub to ask for help during the coronavirus shutdown.The Pavilion, on Market Street,and Bank Streets Salmon Inn are calling on people to buy gt vouchers that can be used when the premises re-open.Cinema manager Andrew Poole said: \"Itrsquos vital we are in a strong position and lsquobusiness readyrsquo when the time comes to re-open, and by supporting your local business now by buying gt vouchers or gt cards this can make a massive dference to the survivability of that business.\"Partner of the Salmon Inn Michelle Douglas said the pub was going through an \"extremely dficult time\".She said: \"Buying a gt voucher will help us to keep operating as a business while the shutdown is in place.

Editor Andrew McQuarrie grabbed a torch, pulled on his big-boy trousers and joined the funhellipIt was .pm on a Saturday night and I was trying to communicate with a supernatural beingusing a pair of copper rods.Having done as instructed and asked the tools a simple lsquoYes Norsquo question, I was slightly dismayed to see the rods stubbornly remaining still, the spirit apparently refusing to play ball.Sheila, an employee of UK Ghost Nights, appeared quite perplexed as her eyes darted between me and the rods.ldquoAre you a sceptic  she asked, a faint edge of suspicion laced in her voice.I admitted that I was indeed a sceptic, but one who was more than willing to be converted into a true believer.Happy with this answer, Sheila ushered me into a corner that was, she said, known to be particularly popular with spirits.ldquoAre we in Melrose  I asked the rods, willing them to show even the smallest hint of movement.But after a full minute of tense observation, it was plain to see the equipment would not co-operate.An hour earlier, when the ghost experts were delivering their briefing, they had promised the  paying customers that ldquonothing is fabricated on the tours.The insinuation, it seemed to me, was that this would likely not be a night of high drama and theatrics.Nevertheless, I couldnrsquot help but feel a bit disappointed that my opening bid to converse with the dead had fallen distinctly flat.And over the next four hours, so it would prove, my luck would not change much.Yet, as I wandered the portrait-lined corridors of the George  Abbotsford Hotel, trying to channel my inner Bill Murray, some of the people to whom I spoke offered compelling tales.Few were as gripping as those delivered by Dawn Barrett - owner of the hotel for the last  months - and her cooking team.Among the unusual goings-on noted by Mrs Barrett, for instance, were lights turning on and off on their own, furniture moving around, footsteps at all hours and even the feeling of her hair being brushed.Asked for her views on the supernatural, Mrs Barrett said: ldquoI definitely believe - Irsquove seen and heard too much now.It was Mrs Barrett herself who contacted UK Ghost Nights in the first place, with the aim of getting to the root of what makes the hotel tick.ldquoI want to know why they [spirits] are here. I donrsquot understand how they can put lights on and off. I just want to understand it more, she said.Head chef Kailee Reidie, , spoke of an alarming encounter with a spirit who has come to be known as John, supposedly a grouchy ex-chef.As Kailee turned on the fryer one evening, while she was alone in the kitchen, her hair was pulled back so sharply that she was thrown into the table behind her, banging her head.ldquoAs soon as I turned my back on him [John], thatrsquos when it happened, recalled Kailee, going on to explain her emotions at the time.ldquoI was in shock because I knew he [John] was there, but Irsquom not a big believer in ghostshellip Irsquove never seen John - itrsquos just a feeling.Just a feeling. Well, there was certainly a sense of foreboding in some areas of the building - not least the cellar and the attic.In one of the attic rooms, we indulged in an activity called the lsquohuman pendulumrsquo. This entails three people standing in a row, with the person in the middle acting as the spiritrsquos means of communication.When the spirit is asked a Yes No question, the piggy in the middle is expected to rock forwards for a lsquoYesrsquo and backwards for a lsquoNorsquo - a movement being directed by the answering spirit.One by one, the customers lined up to participate in this creepy experiment, watched by the rest of the room with a mixture of excitement and dread.Time and again, the spiritrsquos presence was well felt. In fact, there turned out to be a number of obliging spirits, each surprisingly keen to answer questions including, lsquoDo you have childrenrsquo  and lsquoAre you happy with us being herersquo As I watched this circus unfold, I was praying Irsquod be able to endure the entire episode as an observer, a witness to the craziness.Not so much because I was scared - although I was a little, I must admit - but more because I knew what would happen.,params: .pushldquoAndrew, would you like to have a shot in the middle What followed was several minutes of embarrassment for everyone.Because of course I didnrsquot move. Not even an inch. And the change in atmosphere was so marked that I genuinely wonderedmy trousers had somehow dropped to my ankles without my noticing.Thankfully, my clothes had remained bound to my body, but any faith I might have had in the ghost-hunting process was sliding away fast.As the tour continued, taking in several other locations promising ldquohigh activity, it became increasingly dficult to muster the energy to stay alert, with the clock ticking into the wee small hours.That said, there was one incident which aroused a certain degree of puzzlement - a maglite which appeared to flash when certain questions were posed.Admittedly, that was a curious development. But still not enough to push me into the camp of believers.The more I dwelt on the nightrsquos events, however, the more I came to realise the deeper signicance of it all.Before the tour, UK Ghost Nights founder Lisa Tedstill had made sure I was aware of the crucial equipment to bring.ldquoAll you need is a torch and a sense of humour, she said, going on to lay her finger on the true essence of the affair.ldquoWe donrsquot guarantee there will be any paranormal activity - anyone who does that is a charlatan.ldquoBut we can guarantee everybody will have a very fun experience.And, indeed, while I may have left the George  Abbotsford that night without a firmer belief in ghosts, I certainly ed home with a smile."},{"url":null,"title":"council-powers-handed-chief-meetings-scrapped","story":"PLANS to hand Scottish Borders Councilchief Tracey Logan delegated control of decision-making are expected to be rubber-stamped this week.It comes hot on the heels of Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos instruction that everyone in the UK should spend most of their time at home in order to counter the coronavirus outbreak.But on Thursday , in an unprecedented move, proposals to temporarily delegate the local authorityrsquos decision-making responsibility to the Chief Executive will be passed.Council meetings in Newtown St Boswells will be cancelled until September , with the exception of vital committee meetings which will be done through video-conferencing.SBC chief legal officer Nuala McKinlay stated: ldquoAs the virus makes a wider impact on public le, Scottish Borders Council must consider how to respond.\"In taking any decision to protect health by limiting social contact, it must also ensure processes are in place to enable it to continue to make urgent decisions.ldquoIn order to allow decisions to be made, it is proposed that all those decision-making s of council which can lawfully be delegated, be delegated to the chief executive to be made in consultation with members and relevant senior officers.It is also proposed that any committee meetings which do need to take place between now and October will be held via remote video links.Ms McKinlay added: ldquoThe Local Government in Scotland Act  allows a local authority to y that process and conduct a meeting by other ways.

To use it, you have to prick your finger to produce a drop of blood, which is analysed on the device.The test detects the presence of IGM, an antibody that appears in your body early on in the infection, and IGG, which increases when the body responds to the virus.It takes just  to  minutes to complete the test.The results of some of the tests on order can be read by anyone, but others would need to be interpreted by healthcare professionals.How will the test help fight coronavirus In a previous briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that these types of tests could be a ldquogame changer in regards to the ongoing pandemic.Speaking to the Huffington Post, Professor Trudie Lang, director of the Global Health Network, University of Oxford, said that these types of tests would be ldquotransformational in the fight against the virus.She said: ldquoWe can make sure wersquove got doctors or nurses who can work safely in hospitals.

It was so strange not being able to give each other a hug, as we have always done over the past  years of our friendship.I chose a walk in which I hoped we would meet nobody , and we walked two metres apart. Despite our plan not to talk about the virus, we inevitably ended up doing just that, although not all the time.The walk took us to the site of the old Byres Kirk, just beyond Ormiston. As hoped, it was deserted, and so we entered.The eeriness of current events affected my behaviour. I walked around with my friend, carefully ensuring I touched nothing. The original kirk built here in  is long gone. It replaced an even older kirk, the remains of which are hidden in private woodland next to nearby Ormiston Hall not far from this site.The first kirk at Byres was eventually demolished and replaced by a neo-gothic building in the s. But after the opening of a new church in Ormiston in the s, Byres Kirk was finally abandoned and eventually demolished in the s.But the graves remain, including war graves, and there is also a headstone erected by Isabella Burns, sister of the famous poet, to the memory of her children.It was this headstone I had come to see. Isabella was the youngest sister of Robert Burns and she lived in Ormiston and Tranent for a while. In  she was widowed, with nine children, three girls and six boys. She set up a village school to help make ends meet.Itrsquos dficult to imagine what her le must have been like, but I think the fact she was part of Robert Burnsrsquo immediate family may have given her a status and a degree of respect most women were denied.I found the stone and was intrigued by it. Two of Isabellarsquos children are mentioned one of them, Edward, died at the age of  in China.ldquoChina  I said out loud to myself, wondering what he was doing there. I saw the date of his death: November , .Then it dawned on me: the Opium Wars! He must have been a soldier. I quickly Googled it on my phone and sure enough he was serving in a regiment there.I stood for a moment, thinking about the story behind this scant piece of information. The Opium Wars are not usually a prominent part of our history curriculum, although they should be. The British state went to war with China to safeguard the ability of British traders to sell opium to the Chinese, which resulted in  million addicts there. Itrsquos a dark part of our imperial history, and the fact that a nephew of Robert Burns ended up dead in China defending state-sponsored drug smuggling by Britain seemed horribly ironic and sad. But it also gave me a sense of the connectedness we all have. The decisions people make, especially those in power, affect the lives of others in ways we will never know or predict.The memorial headstone also had a later inscription which recorded the death of Isabella herself. She lived until she was  and died in . She isnrsquot buried in this graveyard, however, as she spent the last years of her le in Ayrshire and was laid to rest in Alloway Kirkyard.Such a web of le and connection, now mostly long forgotten, revealed by this one memorial stone.As I left, I noticed the trees: oak, sycamore, beech and yew. They seemed to grow out of lost human memory, asthey were now s of forgotten stories.On ourjourney to the car, we passed another memorial stone, this time to the Polish soldiers who had been based in Ormiston Hall in the s during the war. This too is now a time of memory fading, but not forgotten, as the flowers someone left revealed.We had succeeded in a walk seeing almost nobody, except a passing cyclist at the end. Next time we go on such a walk, spring will have arrived undisturbed by human footprints.

support developers are already seeing applications for public meetings lodged without a date or venue for exhibiting future proposals.And Tony Thomas, director of APT Planning  Development in East Linton, says ensuring the building industry is ready to resume as soon as possible may mean future consultations have to be carried out on websites.Mr Thomas revealed that one consultation had already begun online as Queensberry Properties launched a website inviting feedback on its proposals for Finance House in Edinburgh.The website was launched after a planned second public consultation this month had to be cancelled and gives people a chance to view the plans to turn the former office building into residential accommodation with associated commercial and leisure facilities.And it could be the way people are consulted in the future as more companies look at ways to engage with the public without face-to-face gatherings.The first public stage of planning applications for large developments is lodging a pre-application noticewith a council informing them that public consultation meetings are being held.The meetings, which usually take place in town halls or community centres, give local residents a chance to see the proposals for the first time, talk to developers and give their views.However, that crucial stage is on hold for some developments after the lockdown, which prohibits gatherings of more than two people.At Millerhill, Midlothian, a pre-application notice for housing at Wellington Farm on land known as Dukersquos Field has been lodged with no date or venue for the public exhibition.In a note to the council, the developers have said: ldquoIn light of Governmentadvice which seeks to minimise the spread of coronavirus, non-essential contact is limited at his time.ldquoWe are therefore awaiting the advice of the Scottish Government before making any formal arrangements for pre-application public engagement.Mr Thomas said it was vital for the industry that companies were ready to resume work as soon as possible.He said: ldquoThe approach to all aspects of the planning process is very much an emerging issue.ldquoThe authorities are working hard to continue lsquoas normalrsquo whilst working remotely and this is hugely appreciated.ldquoIt will be important that as and when restrictions are lted the development industry is ready to respond quickly.ldquoFrom a workload perspective, most clients are looking to progress with projects that are already in the pipeline and to be fair the alternative would be catastrophic for a sector that feels peaks and troughs very quickly.ldquoWhere public consultation is still proposed programmed, the only way to achieve this will be to set up a dedicated website with the ability to post

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig.

Over the last couple of days he talked of getting people back to work after Easter - a ldquobeautul timeline - at the same time as threatening to put New York, currently the worst affected state, into complete quarantine.Donrsquot get me wrong, I was relieved when the  trillion government support package his administration drew up was finally signed off. But based on what family and friends are telling us on daily calls, itrsquos going to take more than a one-off , cheque for low and middle earners for this to be anything other than a catastrophe for the worldrsquos richest country.The coronavirus trajectory is looking particularly ominous in the US, with its case rate the highest in the worldand a death rate that is already on course to outpace Italy.No country can escape the devastating effects of this virus, of course, no health service is not at risk of being overwhelmed. But as anyone who has spent signicant time there will know and understand, the US is a nation spectacularly ill-suited to a pandemic of this nature and magnitude. Even without the addition of Donald Trump.Indeed, the virus is already exposing many of US societyrsquos in-built weaknesses. Most fundamentally, the non-universal healthcare system that means millions of Americans have no way to pay for treatment should they become ill. Even those who do have medical insurance could find themselves with huge, le-ruining bills, depending on their medical history and policy exclusions. At a time like this, a complex, profit-drivensystem which links healthcare with employment status is particularly likely to fail.The notoriously ungenerous welfare system only compounds this. Many people will feel compelled to keep working rather than following instructions to stay at home. The additions to unemployment benefit announced in the support package are unlikely to provide much reassurance for those in this situation.Demographics is also key. Much of the interior of this vast country, including many of the southern states and rural areas, are poor and poorly resourced to a level that would astound many Europeans. If they are short of ventilators and hospital beds in New York, I dread to think what it will be like in rural Arkansas and Mississippi, where higher proportions of the population are elderly, infirm, unemployed and uninsured.But, as Mr Trumprsquos popularity in some of these places affirms, there are other fundamental issues at play. Many Americans distrust the very idea of the state, and their in-built inidualism may make them balk at the idea of having freedoms curtailed. They have no experience of the state having this much direct control over their lives, no experience in living memory of sacricing personal freedoms, as Europeans did during the Second World War. I note with concern that in some parts of the US there has been a rush on guns as well as toilet paper.This is also the most ided of nations, along political, geographical, economic and religious lines, which plays into a narrative of suspicion and rage. Only two weeks ago, while visiting the southern states, I spoke to people who believed coronavirus had been created by China in retaliation for US trade tarfs. Others talked of it being a plague sent by God to punish sinners.Even a well-run administration would have been up against it. As it stands, Mr Trumprsquos response, strewn with delay, contrary messages and personal insults, may already have cost lives.Despite the worry I feel for my American family, I want to end on a positive. I have no doubt the ingenuity, tenaciousness and \"can do\" attitude of people there, that other strand of the inidualism mentioned earlier, will play an important role in how the world tackles this crisis in the months ahead. On this front, I hope America continues to be the home of the brave."},{"url":null,"title":"never-andrew-neil-needed-now","story":"If, for example, you ever had a hankering to be a housewe in the Soviet Union and queue for essential foodstuffs, then why not pop down to your local supermarket and join the line  Wearing of headscarves and knee socks optional.Fancy feeling like a character in a zombie horror movie  Easy.

Its Britain this and Britain that, and we are one big happy family living in a Dadrsquos Army world.That was the script for the first week of lockdown, anyway. Now there is a new mood gathering, and not before time.: How Scotland hit deaths recordIt was understandable in the early phases of this crisis that there should be a rush to suspend politics as usual. The first PMQs and FMQs as the extent of the emergency emerged were models of restraint, civility and supportiveness.In journalism too, as in society at large, there was an instinctive reluctance to point fingers. Given the enormity of what has happened, and the rate at which the pandemic has unfolded, many have been, again understandably, stunned into quietude and acquiescence. Surrounded by so much suffering and loss it seemed almost trivial, unhelpful even, to fret over details. Everyone was trying their best in a situation none of us had experienced before.We knew this already from the experience of South Korea and Singapore. We know, too, that testing is vital in getting self-isolating NHS staff back to workthey have had the all-clear.: Edinburgh festivals cancelledBut here we are, some  days later ndash a relative eternity in terms of this virus ndash and governments in London and Edinburgh are failing to hit their targets on testing. There were supposed to be , people tested a day, building to ,. Even this was pathetically low compared to Germany, which can carry out three times that. Yet the UK cannot even hit the lower mark. On Monday,  people were tested. There are not enough kits and labs to ramp up testing to the level required. This is not the first time that reality has failed to match government promises. Remember the antibody test that would tell peoplethey had had the virus and were now most likely immune  The one described by Boris Johnson on March  as a ldquogame-changer  The Prime Minister said trials could start within a month. Weeks on, how close are we to a roll out of these tests Then there is the great Personal Protective Equipmentmystery. Every day a Minister or health official stands at a podium in Downing Street and reels out the statistics on how many masks are available, how many aprons. Millions and millions we are told.Yet also every day, NHS and social care staff are reporting that they do not have the equipment that gives them a fighting chance of staying safe and well. It is scandalous in a supposedly advanced, wealthy society that NHS doctors have to set up a crowdfunding site to buy essential items. Well done and god bless the likes of Scots actor James McAvoy who donated pound, to the campaign, but it should not be necessary in the first place.: Warning on small firmsOn all these matters, and more, governments must be held to account. With Westminster and Holyrood going into recess, and possibly sitting for fewer days when they , it is even more essential that the media is allowed to do its job.We have, of course, the daily press conferences in London and Edinburgh. While vital, they have their limitations, the most obvious of which is the lack of follow-up questions. Time and again the questions being asked are not answered, but there is no comeback and the show rolls on.What is required, in addition to these daily press conferences, are extended interviews with Ministers. Some have taken place, but more are needed, particularly ones where the questioner can drill down for answers. Never has Andrew Neil been more missed than now.It should be said that some of our politicians are reacting to this crisis better than others. Even those who disagree with her on much  would have to concede Scotlandrsquos First Minister has been a been a model of clarity and a reassuring presence throughout.As for the Prime Minister and his Cabinet, there is much talk of a vigorous, ordered response, but once again there is a large gap between the rhetoric and the reality.There will come a time for reckoning on this pandemic, locally, nationally and globally. That could be a long way down the road. Many will have to account for what they did, or did not do, in this crisis and explain how vital time was lost in preparing for it.In the meantime, the public has to feel sure it is being told everything it needs to know, and that the steps being taken by governments are the right ones. We need answers, yes, but we need a lot more questioning besides.The public is ready, willing and able to do the right thing during this lockdown.

Covid-, which it believes could offer up to three million doses a week from June.BAT said the vaccine is now in pre-clinical testing and has the potential to offer a safer and faster way to develop vaccines than traditional methods.It is being developed by its US firm Kentucky BioProcessingusing tobacco plant technology.BAT saidsuccessful and with the ldquoright partners and support from government agencies, it could manufacture between one million and three million doses a week, though it will need to get through rigorous testing before being approved for use in humans.The group is currently in talks with the US Food and Drug Administration and the UK Department of Health and Social Care with hopes to partner with government agencies to bring the vaccine to clinical studies.Dr David OrsquoReilly, director of scientic research at BAT, said: ldquoVaccine development is challenging and complex work, but we believe we have made a signicant breakthrough with our tobacco plant technology  and stand ready to work with governments and all stakeholders to help win the war against Covid-.ldquoWe fully align with the United Nations plea, for a whole-of-society approach to combat global problems.The firm said KBP ndash bought by its US subsidiary Reynolds American Inc in  ndash has been looking at alternative uses of tobacco plants for some time, including plant-based vaccines.It was one of the few firms that helped develop an effective treatment for Ebola in  and has recently been working with the US government on seasonal influenza vaccines.It added that KBP would be developing the coronavirus vaccine on a not-for-profit basis.Tobacco plant technology is thought to have advantages over traditional development methods as it can produce initial vaccines in the plants in just six weeks, instead of months.It is also possibly safer because tobacco plants cannot host so-called pathogens that cause human disease.And they have the potential to deliver an effective immune response in a single dose, according to BAT.ldquoWe are committed to contributing to the global effort to halt the spread of Covid- using this technology, added Dr OrsquoReilly.Analysts at Jefferies said the announcement by BAT was ldquosomewhat surprising, but it highlights the scientic might of tobacco giants.The move is also likely to raise eyebrows, given increasing scientic evidence that smoking cigarettes increases the risk of serious illness caused by coronavirus.A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found smokers are around one-and-a-half times more likely to progress to the severe stage of coronavirus than non-smokers.But Owen Bennett at Jefferies said BATrsquos vaccine news ldquoillustrates the scientic

The programme reveals that at the same time, Cass brother Martin was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease putting a crushing strain on both and leading to a dficult conversation over whether they could continue their pioneering work.The pair resolved to carry on, however, Cass brother died a few months later aged just , and in February last year Laura received the devastating news that partner Kat had taken her own le.The documentary highlights how the loss of former player Kat sent waves of shock and grief right through the club, leaving players and coaching staff battling to cope.Club manager Laura said: ldquoThe day Kat died is the worst day of my le and always will be.

I really miss her.Despite being born in dferent decades and dferent cities, both grew up with a razor-like focus for football which was confounded by a male-dominated sport, with only a handful of female role-models and a dearth of opportunities to take part.Cas, who as a youngster is recalled pushing a football instead of a doll in her toy pram, met Laura in the s when both played for Glasgow Universityrsquos womenrsquos football team.The two ndash described in the programme as like a ldquocomedy double act - found a shared determination to confront the lack of equal opportunities in the sport, leading to them hatching a kitchen table plan to create a club of their own.Glasgow City chairperson Cas, , from Newlands in Glasgow, said: ldquoI just remember thinking, Ive just got to change it. Ive just got to do something to make this possible and keep pushing forwards so that it is possible because its not fair.Laura, , from Clarkston in East Renfrewshire, adds: ldquoEven as a young kid, I would never accept that girls shouldnt be allowed to do something, even though everyone perceived that as the norm, I certainly didnt perceive it as the norm and I set out to change it.Glasgow City FC won the league in its inaugural season and is now the most successful club in the country with  domestic league titles to its name and a thriving academy facility offering training for girls.While the clubs closest competition in recent years has come from Hibs, moves by Rangers and Celtic into professional womens game has raised the stakes, setting the scene for a season which, had Covid- not happened, would have been one of the most competitive for years.Professor Karen Boyle, Professor of Feminist Media Studies and Programme Director for the MSc in Applied Gender Studies at University of Strathclyde, said the Glasgow City pioneers arrived at a time when equality was entering a new phase.\"In the Nineties, there was this sense of oh, weve done that, equality is done. We had Blairs babes, we had girl power, we had this sense that actually, equality had been achieved which of course was a complete fiction,\" she said.\"Particularly in arenas like sport, the advances that had been made were so, so tiny, there was still so much of a way to go.

they interact with each other and their environment.It then integrates observations into a framework that can offer real insight into an animalrsquos emotional state.Describing the new approach, Ms

tell people whether they currently have Covid- as well as antibody tests to see whether people have previously had the infection.The Government is currently working with nine potential providers who are battling to produce an antibody test and is also looking at whether people could be issued with immunity certicates to prove they are able to resume their usual activities.Mr Hancock said he would only approve those tests that worked, adding: \"Approving tests that dont work is dangerous and I will not do it.\"The Secretary of State, who has recovered from Covid- and came out of self-isolation on Thursday, said he came back \"redoubled in my determination to fight this virus with everything Ive got.\"As he paid an emotional tribute to those who have died, including doctors, nurses and mental health professionals, he said the Government would \"strain every sinew to defeat\" coronavirus once and for all.\"If the past few weeks have shown us anything, its that we are steadfast as a country in our resolve to defeat this invisible killer\" he continued.Mr Hancock explained the UK lacked a large diagnostics industry so was having to build from a \"lower base\" than the likes of Germany, which is testing around , people per day.He said a country-wide shortage of swabs had been \"resolved\" but that there remained a \"global challenge\" around sourcing the reagent chemicals needed for the tests.Mr Hancock said NHS staff would be able to get tested for Covid- \"absolutely before the end of the month\".Currently, around , tests per day are being carried out in the UK.The Health Secretary said his five part strategy was:*swab testing in Public Health England and NHS labs*using commercial partners, including universities and private businesses, to establish more swab testing*introducing antibody blood tests to determine whether people have had Covid-*surveillance to determine the rate of infection and how it is spreading across the country and*building an \"at-scale\" diagnostics industry to reach , tests by the end of April.Labourrsquos Jon Ashworth welcomed the , tests a day announcement but noted how NHS staff would recall that only a few weeks ago the Prime Minister was promising , a day.ldquoWe look forward to seeing the details of how this commitment will be delivered, especially for NHS and care staff for whom this is now a pressing and urgent priority.\"It has taken us weeks to get to , tests today, and we still have no details of what proportion of this , will be PCR tests or antibody tests, he added.At the press conference, Mr Hancockdefended his decision to prioritise testing of patients over NHS staff and said he thought any Health Secretary would have done the same.He explained: ldquoI understand why NHS staff want tests, so they can get back to the front line, of course I do.ldquoBut I took the decision that the first priority has to be the patients for whom the results of a test could be the dference in treatment that is the dference between le and death.ldquoI believe anybody in my shoes would have taken the same decision.The Secretary of State also announced that more than pound billion of historic

The payments industry, including all contactless card issuers, has completed all the work to enable retailers to upgrade as soon as they can.If a retailer wants to start accepting contactless payments at the higher limit of £ it should get in touch with its acquirer.For consumers spending more than £ there are many ways to choose to pay, for example through Chip  PIN and other alternatives such as mobile payments which do not have an upper limit when authenticated through biometric technologies.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As a result, we’ve had to take the decision to focus our efforts on the collection and disposal of household and commercial waste, while suspending our recycling services.”The following changes will be made:Mr Richardson added: “In normal times, we greatly appreciate the efforts people make to recycle a wide range of household and commercial items. But these are far from normal times, which is why we’ve had to make the dficult decision to suspend our recycling services.“We are not the only Council making this move, and we understand that  of the  local authorities across Scotland are also working on revised arrangements.“We are asking folkat all possible to store their recycling until these services can begin again. We’re aware that this won’t be an option for everyone, but we would ask that recyclable items are only included as a last resort on grey bin collection days.”He added: “People will be disappointed, and we apologise for the inconvenience these measures will cause. But in these unprecedented times, there is a need to ensure we can continue with the most essential operations with a limited workforce during the weeks and months ahead.“We ask all businesses and householders to be considerate during this time and to make every effort to minimise the waste that is put out for collection, bearing in mind that higher than normal volumes can cause delays and missed collections for other households and businesses.“We are extremely grateful for your co-operation during this dficult period and also for the efforts of our office and depot staff, crews and drivers, who are already going above and beyond in providing vital waste collection services under extremely challenging conditions.”Any further changes will be announced through local media, on the Council website and using OIC’s social media channels.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This came as welcome news to Orkney MSP Liam McArthur, who had previously highlighted these concerns. The moves were also welcomed by Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston.The Loganair aircraft will be based at Glasgow Airport but can operate throughout Scotland.   Loganair pilots will be operating the aircraft as usual, and late last week, all received a special briefing from the airline and the Scottish Ambulance Service on the nature of the deployment.Work has continued in Loganair’s Engineering and Flight Operations teams at Glasgow over the weekend and into this week to ensure full readiness of the aircraft ahead of full mission readiness from Friday  April.Loganair is also now working to convert a larger Saab  aircraft, capable of operating into all Highlands and Islands airports apart from Barra, to become an air ambulance with the capability to carry two Epishuttle pods and accompanying medical teams simultaneously.  It is expected this aircraft will be available within the next seven days.Loganair’s Chief Executive Jonathan Hinkles said: “The team effort to make this happen, moving from a concept to an operational solution in just a week, has been absolutely incredible.#Between the SAS and Loganair teams, the concept, testing and training has all taken place and we’re also grateful for the support from the Civil Aviation Authority in progressing this project.“Although the circumstances under which all of this work has been undertaken are ones that we’d never have wished to see, I’m heartened that the effort which has gone into this is truly admirable.

The BDA has advised patients in pain to phone their dental practice who will assess or triage them, and will do their best to provide help, as far as possible, using one of the three As - advice, analgesia or antibiotics.The BDA said it hopes that these measures will be enough for most routine cases. If urgent treatment is absolutely necessary, however, patients will be advised to attend the closest emergency clinic when these are established. Treatments at these centres will be largely limited to extractions or draining abscesses. Richard Graham, chair of the BDA#s NI General Dental Practice Committee, said: This is a very stressful time for everyone, dental teams included, so we are very proud of colleagues who are in the forefront of finding a solution for people in dental pain.

We are extremely proud of all our staff who are working in refuge, registration, cemeteries, reception and other front facing services, he said.We have many staff who are continuing to work from home ensuring that when this crisis is over we can bounce back as quickly as possible.Our senior management team are regularly briefing party leaders as things change and evolve and we are supporting them as decisions are being made very quickly. We are proud our facilities are being used to help our NHS and will continue to play our role in dealing with this crisis.His words were echoed by Mr Cuthbertson who also questioned the expense of such an operation. The erection of dual language signage, like many tasks the Technical Services Team are tasked with daily, are most definitely not essential services, he said.The council#s priority at this stage is to maintain the bin collections and support the community, he added.In the past I have raised the issue of costs of these signs, figures often quoted by council are not a true picture when you take into consideration the consultation, procurement and delivery stages.Mid Ulster District Council has been asked to confirm whether the installation of further street signs has now been suspended.When initially asked on Monday what the total cost of these signs were andcouncil considered the work to be essential at this time, a spokesperson for Mid Ulster District Council provided the following statement on Monday.Where resources and social distancing restrictions allow, we have continued to deliver services, from grass-cutting and litter picking to property management activity, including the erection of street name plates which had previously been agreed, ordered and received into stock, the statement said.Two were erected on the Annaghmakeown Road at a cost of £.Belfast Most ReadChurch minister sues Belfast hotel after it #calls a halt# to religious eventFamous Northern Ireland faces share photos from past as part of latest social media crazePSNI#s George Clarke leaves force to #pursue other opportunities#Murder probe launched after death ofLisburn assault victim Natasha MelendezSinn Fein and DUP say Irish language signs have to wait,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

PA Archive PA Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappEU and UK officials are meeting to discuss how arrangements will operate after the transition period ends. April   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailFour Stormont leaders have written a joint letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson expressing their concern at the UK#s rejection of a request by the EU to establish an office in Belfast.RTE reported the bloc asked to set up an office in the city in order to ensure agreements made in the withdrawal deal were being followed.The protocol would see checks carried out on goods coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain to determinethey were to enter the EU through the Republic.It#s reported the EU wants a physical presence, which would have customs and veterinary staff, saying there is provision in the protocol for such an office, however this request has been declined by the UK Government.Sinn Fein#s Michelle O#Neill, Alliance Party leader Naomi Long, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood and the Green Party#s Clare Bailey have now penned a letter to the PM stating they feel such an office is necessary to ensure the implementation of commitments in the Withdrawal Agreement.You are aware that under, the terms negotiated by your Government, EU representatives have a right under law to be present during any activities relating to the protocol implementation, they said.It is also for the EU to determine the extent to which it wishes to exercise these rights, including the opening of an office in Belfast staffed by EU representatives who can carry out their s without interruption by the Westminster Government.The letter states it is necessary for EU experts to be based Belfast to liaise with the UK Government and NI Executive on the implementation of the protocol.To oppose the opening of such an office by the EU in Belfast represents an act of bad faith by your Government and a breach of trust at this critical stage of the process, they added.We are calling on you to reverse the approach taken by your Government without delay and comply with the request made by the European Commission.The protocol states that the EU shall have a right to be present and the UK would facilitate such a presence. Brussels officials believe this entails an office, however, officials on the UK side said this could lead to joint patrols and a permanent presence.The EU, it is believed, is to insist on an office in order to assure member states the agreement is being followed.RTE reported the matter was raised at the first teleconference of the EU-UK joint committee which is tasked with working out the finer points of how the Irish protocol will work at the end of the transition period. A UK government spokesperson said: We received an initial request from the EU and responded to decline the proposal in February. We have since received a follow up letter to which we will respond in due course.Before the UK#s departure from the EU in January, the EU Commission had an office on Bedford Street in the city centre. EU officials told RTE they understood the sensitivities around having an office in Belfast, given the political tension in Northern Ireland since the Brexit referendum, and given that there would not be similar offices in Edinburgh and Cardf.A UK government spokesperson said: We received an initial request from the EU and responded to decline the proposal in February.

The Foyle MLA said:Many Northern Ireland businesses are struggling to survive the coronavirus pandemic. The British government put in place emergency measures, which should assist them. These measures are welcome, however many businesses are coming to me and saying that they are having serious dficulty in accessing these schemes in the way they are supposed to operate.” I have written to Economy Minister, DianeDoddsMLA asking her to press the UK government to urgently stress to banks across theUK that they must do more to enable local businesses to access the funds they need. Many businesses will struggle to survive this pandemicwe do not act quickly. We are dealing with a health emergency, but it is fast becoming an economic emergency.” googletag.cmd.push In the letter, the Foyle MLA says she received representations from several businesses in recent days, who have expressed concern at the responses from banks in Northern Irelandregardingthe operation of UK government support schemes.Those concerns include banks tellingbusinesses they can only access the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemethey fail to meet criteria for a loan from that bank under normal lending terms, which may be signicantly more expensive and which the business may not wish to engage in. A number of banks have told businesses they are not engaging in the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, or are only doing so for sums much less than the poundm maximum specied by the government. googletag.cmd.push Many businesses are too large to access the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, but not large enough to access the Bank of England scheme for larger companies. Some banks are only considering applications under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme from existing customers. In addition, businesses - and homeowners with mortgages - who are being given holidays on loan repayments, but no extension on theof term of the repayment, are finding they are faced by higher monthly repayments at the end of the crisis, when they are still likely to be struggling financially.We believe that these are systemic problems with the government’s measures of support, which need to be addressed by the UK government with participating banks and building societies. It is our understanding that these problems are not unique to Northern Ireland and are the same for businesses operating in Great Britain, the SDLP representative added.Indeed, Lord Leigh of Hurley has made similar points in relation to the attitude of banks in Great Britain. He has issued a statement saying:“I am hearing that the banks are being very uncooperative. They have been seeking personal guarantees, although some have now relented. I have heard of one bank who told a customer that although their turnover was below poundm they had more than  employees and were therefore ineligible. Likewisestart upsand new tech companies will never get it as they have no profit history, indeed some no revenue yet!Clearly the banks are not keen on these loans. They would rather encourage customers to take a regular product, on which of course they can charge fees as opposed to the CBLS.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Other businesses face greater demand than usual and many of them have implemented new safety measures in the workplace to ensure work can go on and needs are met across many sectors. Chief Executive of the Londonderry Chamber, Paul Clancy said: “The response of the business community at this time has been phenomenal.

However, many more face increased pressures and a surge in demand for services. googletag.cmd.push “The demand for food and other essential items such as cleaning items and medicines means that lots of businesses in those supply chains are working even harder to meet the demand. “I have heard from many businesses in recent days who have introduced new social distancing measures to keep things going. That means reducing sht patterns to manage numbers of people at work at any one time, or re-engineering factory floor plans to protect staff. Some we know have even sought out new premises to use in the short term. “The pragmatism of businesses at this time is great to see, not to mention the dedication of workers who continue to show up at work every day. Safety of the workforce has never been more important and we have seen so many examples of responsible employers and their staff working together to manage this. googletag.cmd.push “Lots of them may not see themselves as frontline workers, but they are contributing to the wider national effort that will ensure that shelves are stocked and people do not go without at this very worrying time.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Minister also emphasised that every conceivable effort is being made to improve both situations. “I can assure staff and the wider public that these two issues are receiving absolute priority. It’s no secret that MOT centres and the SSE Arena are among the options being pursued by the HSC system as staff testing sites. “Staff testing numbers are expanding and will continue to do so as rapidly as possible. I fully understand the frustration that we have not been able to scale up testing numbers more quickly. googletag.cmd.push “This is not down to a lack of will or action. There are signicant challenges including laboratory and staffing capacity and the unprecedented levels of global demand for testing reagents and swabs. “I want to make clear that we have been in contact with local company Randox over the past number of days regarding its testing product. We have been informed by Randox that its production line is fully geared towards the NHS as a whole and NI will receive a share of that. “However, we will also continue to explore procuring testing products separately from NHS wide arrangements. We do not want to be dependent on one source for these products.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Swann stressed:“I am confident we will make signicant progress on staff testing in the days ahead. But I want to be totally frank about the pressures that exist. If there were quick fixes available, I would certainly have used them.” Turning to PPE, the Minister said:“Our health service has signicant levels of PPE in stock at present but need to boost these quantities given the expected level of demand in coming weeks. Our PPE supplies have been supported through release of % of the emergency pandemic stockpile as announced last week – in the region of  million items. “Updated UK-wide NHS guidance on PPE use has been issued. This guidance will inform PPE use across our system and help us to prioritise distribution. “I fully understand that staff on the frontline need reassurance. I believe the updated guidance and securing greater quantities of PPE for Northern Ireland will both play a part in allaying concerns. “I want to make absolutely clear that the PPE guidance is about ensuring staff have the appropriate level of protection for the circumstances they are working in – it is absolutely not, nor will it ever be, about seeking to restrict the use of equipment.” He continued:“The situation with PPE supply has been made more challenging by the fact that supply routes from China, a leading global provider, were closed until recently. “I am actively working with the Finance Minister to pursue all feasible supply routes, both international and local. “I recognise that other NI Departments are also facing PPE challenges. We have to tackle this together across the Executive and also to appreciate the scale of global competition for PPE products. The Minister added:“It would be facile for anyone to suggest that there has been any lack of urgency. We are doing everything we can to best of our ability to make things better. “Our health service has been under consider financial pressure for the past  years. That has inevitably had a bearing on its capacity. I cannot undo that, but I will work night and day for the sake of the public and our great health and social care staff.

It read: “During the disturbances of  it enjoyed comparative tranquillity.” Anyone living in the County Derry town at the time of the ill-fated United Irishmen rebellion would no doubt disagree. The ins and outs of the  rebellion were played out at a local level across the country, something local historian Joseph McCoy thinks is not mentioned enough in schools. He says: “I understand the necessity to look at the First and Second World Wars, but they have so little about the place we’re living in, particularly the local stuff. googletag.cmd.push “The story of  in Maghera is complex. There’s a whole plethora of dferent writers on the subject but no two stories are the same. That tells me that they are pulling a lot from folklore.” Troops had been stationed in the town before the rising began in June  and the rebellious plans were being drawn up around them. An account of how recoat army captain Francis Lamont met and married the daughter of hotel proprietor Jack O’Neill bears testament to this. Captain Lamont, second in command to Colonel Leith, had been passing what is now known as Walsh’s, when he found himself transfixed by a young girl working in the hotel. googletag.cmd.push When she ed his glance, the captain turned to his superior and told him in no uncertain terms thatshe were not yet married, she would be his we. The pair were married in May  and Lamont was named on a list of people who donated to the building of Glen chapel, where the couple rest in the graveyard. It was certainly not the last time love flourished with a meeting of eyes in Walsh’s Hotel.  History and folklore have weaved a rich tapestry of tragedy, violence, compassion and love at the foot of the Glenshane in . The town was so involved in the skirmishes that after the uprising failed, Colonel Leith’s redcoat army may have planned to reduce it to rubble in retribution. In an article for the Maghera Times, a local historical paper, Joseph McCoy wrote: “Initial suggestions tell us that the army was prepared to blow the town to pieces with a detachment of cannon, which had been placed on top of a hill overlooking the town.” However, Maghera was spared, and the people lived to pass on the tales of the rebellion’s leaders in the town, many of whom suffered reprisals in its aftermath. Rev. John Glendy  Rev. Glendy provided leadership to the volunteers in the years leading up to , which led to James Spottswood of the Salters Company in Magherafelt admonishing him in print in . He wrote: “Glendy of Maghera is tainted with the blackest principles of revolution. His many sermons are but discourses containing treason. “We have seen him on erse occasion with the Popish priest of Magherafelt in that union of the Romish Church with whom he does conspire against this Realm.” Glendy composed the oath sworn by all members of the United Irishmen, and at some meetings, stood behind a pulpit bearing the legend ‘vive la Republique’, in a nod to the French revolution. As expected, the hunt for Glendy in the aftermath of the rebellion was an earnest one. He fled to a place called the Grove where he stayed with a man named Wilson for a fortnight. One popular account of how Glendy evaded capture was by borrowing a petticoat, cloak, bonnet and stockings from a woman named Sarah MacQuirken and escaping dressed as a woman. His escape was almost foiled when a local magistrate called Forrester recognised him, but his Presbyterian colleague, Clark, restrained him from making an arrest. The unusual attire also helped him evade a passing redcoat patrol in Tobermore, but his fate was sealed when troops surrounded a friend’s house and he was forced to hand himself in. Glendy was imprisoned on a barge moored in Belfast Lough before being exiled in America, where he became chaplain to the US House of Representatives in  and the Senate in . He passed away in Philadelphia in October  and is buried in Baltimore. Walter ‘Watty’ Graham  Synonymous with the GAA tradition in Glen, the name Watty Graham is familiar in Maghera and its surrounds. Graham was an Elder in the local Presbyterian church and had been central to organising the rebellion’s activity in Maghera. After it was quelled, his house was set on fire in reprisal and after a bounty of pound was placed on his head, he set off for Magilligan, from where he intended to travel to Moville. En route, he stopped at the Rectory of Tamlaght, where he intended to collect pound that the occupier, Mr Church owed him. Mr Church said he would have to go to Maghera to get the money but, in truth, intended to turn him into the authorities in a bid to clear his debt and collect a handsome reward. A servant girl overheard Church telling his we of the plan, and he swore her to secrecy, but the girl found a way to warn Watty Graham of the betrayal. In his book ‘Famous Maghera Men, Eoin Walsh writes how the girl warned Graham using the phrase ‘A herring was never taken on bait’. Graham attempted to evade capture by grabbing a shovel from a nearby workman and telling him to run instead. The soldiers followed the workman, but the Rector spotted the ruse and alerted the soldiers to Graham’s presence. He was swtly arrested. Watty Graham was executed, decapitated and his head carried through the town of Maghera in an intimidatory warning to local supporters of the United Irishmen. His relatives are thought to have retrieved his remains and buried them. Mr Chuch did not live long to enjoy the fruits of his betrayal and was bludgeoned to death at the entrance to his avenue while attending a call to tend to a dying parishioner. William ‘Billy’ Cuddy  In the swirling air of mistrust that prevailed after the rebellion, suspicion was easily aroused, and it cost the le of an innocent man in Billy Cuddy. “An unseasonable jest cost him his le,” wrote Joseph McCoy in his Maghera Times article. Cuddy, a wheelwright and blue dyer by trade, had been employed to insert a pane of glass into a leaden window-frame and remarked that it would not be dficult to turn the lead into bullets. The owner of the house reported him to local clerical magistrate called Clotsworthy Soden, who had him arrested and sentenced to death. “Billy Cuddy had a fairly good relationship with the townsfolk, even the soldiers,” says Joseph. “Colonel Leith, commander of the royalist forces in Maghera, understood that Clotsworthy Soden was maybe overstretching his authority, but it was authority he had. “As they were taking him to his death, he recited the nd psalm at the top of his voice referring to the Rector being to blame for his downfall.” Colonel Leith asked Cuddy on the gallowshe wanted to leave the case in his hands. Many watching on considered it to be an act of mercy, but Cuddy tragically misunderstood the offer. He declared he would ‘leave it to a Higher Power’. Leith deemed that this was a rejection of his offer and William Cuddy was hanged. No further indignity was inflicted on his body though, and local tradition has it that he was cut down from the rope while still alive, nursed back to health and spirited away to America. A mock funeral is said to have been held in Maghera, and a weathered stone in the old St Lurach’s church bears the inscription ‘The Burying Place of William Cuddy’. The names of Glendy, Graham and Cuddy will not catch the eye of many modern-day history students, but they are ingrained in the town of Maghera and its rich history from this period. Their heroic and tragic stories will continue to be passed from generation to generation and the tangible history of Maghera’s United Irishmen will endure.

It read: “During the disturbances of  it enjoyed comparative tranquillity.” Anyone living in the County Derry town at the time of the ill-fated United Irishmen rebellion would no doubt disagree. The ins and outs of the  rebellion were played out at a local level across the country, something local historian Joseph McCoy thinks is not mentioned enough in schools. He says: “I understand the necessity to look at the First and Second World Wars, but they have so little about the place we’re living in, particularly the local stuff. googletag.cmd.push “The story of  in Maghera is complex. There’s a whole plethora of dferent writers on the subject but no two stories are the same. That tells me that they are pulling a lot from folklore.” Troops had been stationed in the town before the rising began in June  and the rebellious plans were being drawn up around them. An account of how recoat army captain Francis Lamont met and married the daughter of hotel proprietor Jack O’Neill bears testament to this. Captain Lamont, second in command to Colonel Leith, had been passing what is now known as Walsh’s, when he found himself transfixed by a young girl working in the hotel. googletag.cmd.push When she ed his glance, the captain turned to his superior and told him in no uncertain terms thatshe were not yet married, she would be his we. The pair were married in May  and Lamont was named on a list of people who donated to the building of Glen chapel, where the couple rest in the graveyard. It was certainly not the last time love flourished with a meeting of eyes in Walsh’s Hotel.  History and folklore have weaved a rich tapestry of tragedy, violence, compassion and love at the foot of the Glenshane in . The town was so involved in the skirmishes that after the uprising failed, Colonel Leith’s redcoat army may have planned to reduce it to rubble in retribution. In an article for the Maghera Times, a local historical paper, Joseph McCoy wrote: “Initial suggestions tell us that the army was prepared to blow the town to pieces with a detachment of cannon, which had been placed on top of a hill overlooking the town.” However, Maghera was spared, and the people lived to pass on the tales of the rebellion’s leaders in the town, many of whom suffered reprisals in its aftermath. Rev. John Glendy  Rev. Glendy provided leadership to the volunteers in the years leading up to , which led to James Spottswood of the Salters Company in Magherafelt admonishing him in print in . He wrote: “Glendy of Maghera is tainted with the blackest principles of revolution. His many sermons are but discourses containing treason. “We have seen him on erse occasion with the Popish priest of Magherafelt in that union of the Romish Church with whom he does conspire against this Realm.” Glendy composed the oath sworn by all members of the United Irishmen, and at some meetings, stood behind a pulpit bearing the legend ‘vive la Republique’, in a nod to the French revolution. As expected, the hunt for Glendy in the aftermath of the rebellion was an earnest one. He fled to a place called the Grove where he stayed with a man named Wilson for a fortnight. One popular account of how Glendy evaded capture was by borrowing a petticoat, cloak, bonnet and stockings from a woman named Sarah MacQuirken and escaping dressed as a woman. His escape was almost foiled when a local magistrate called Forrester recognised him, but his Presbyterian colleague, Clark, restrained him from making an arrest. The unusual attire also helped him evade a passing redcoat patrol in Tobermore, but his fate was sealed when troops surrounded a friend’s house and he was forced to hand himself in. Glendy was imprisoned on a barge moored in Belfast Lough before being exiled in America, where he became chaplain to the US House of Representatives in  and the Senate in . He passed away in Philadelphia in October  and is buried in Baltimore. Walter ‘Watty’ Graham  Synonymous with the GAA tradition in Glen, the name Watty Graham is familiar in Maghera and its surrounds. Graham was an Elder in the local Presbyterian church and had been central to organising the rebellion’s activity in Maghera. After it was quelled, his house was set on fire in reprisal and after a bounty of pound was placed on his head, he set off for Magilligan, from where he intended to travel to Moville.

Paul Kerrigan was fouled by Fergal Doherty after three minutes and John Hayes sent Barry Gillis the wrong way from the resulting penalty. Less than  seconds later Fintan Gould blasted to the top corner with his magnicent finish from a tight angle. It would have been easy for Derry to conform to recent expectations and throw in the towel after what was a horrendous start to the game. When Daniel Goulding added a sixth minute free, the small crowd of Derry fans would have feared the worst. - to - behind and coming off the back of four straight defeats, there wasn’t much optimism flying about. googletag.cmd.push The reaction deserves credit. The performance was a massive improvement on that shown against Monaghan and Mayo in the two weeks previous. Paddy Bradley spearheaded the revival, kicking three of Derry’s seven unanswered point that turned a six point deficit into a one-point lead. It was a spell of pretty ruthless football from the Oakleafers, although had Mark Lynch had another half second to get the ball to his foot, his close range effort might not have been smothered by Paddy O’Shea. Still, with seven minutes to go to the half, Damian Cassidy’s side led by a point and were capitalising on a lot of Cork errors. googletag.cmd.push Without Patsy Bradley, Derry lost the kick-out battle and soon Cork were back in the game again. Cork led by threeat the interval, and maintained a similar degree of comfort until the latter stages. But when Raymond Wilkinson and Paddy Bradley pointed to leave Derry just a point behind going into injury time, they just needed a little bit of composure. Charlie Kielt and Mark Lynch kicked a wide each before Paul Kerrigan just booted the ball over the line to allow Marty Duffy to call time and see the Munstermen home with a rare two points from Ulster.

Paul Kerrigan was fouled by Fergal Doherty after three minutes and John Hayes sent Barry Gillis the wrong way from the resulting penalty. Less than  seconds later Fintan Gould blasted to the top corner with his magnicent finish from a tight angle. It would have been easy for Derry to conform to recent expectations and throw in the towel after what was a horrendous start to the game. When Daniel Goulding added a sixth minute free, the small crowd of Derry fans would have feared the worst. - to - behind and coming off the back of four straight defeats, there wasn’t much optimism flying about. googletag.cmd.push The reaction deserves credit. The performance was a massive improvement on that shown against Monaghan and Mayo in the two weeks previous. Paddy Bradley spearheaded the revival, kicking three of Derry’s seven unanswered point that turned a six point deficit into a one-point lead. It was a spell of pretty ruthless football from the Oakleafers, although had Mark Lynch had another half second to get the ball to his foot, his close range effort might not have been smothered by Paddy O’Shea. Still, with seven minutes to go to the half, Damian Cassidy’s side led by a point and were capitalising on a lot of Cork errors. googletag.cmd.push Without Patsy Bradley, Derry lost the kick-out battle and soon Cork were back in the game again. Cork led by threeat the interval, and maintained a similar degree of comfort until the latter stages. But when Raymond Wilkinson and Paddy Bradley pointed to leave Derry just a point behind going into injury time, they just needed a little bit of composure. Charlie Kielt and Mark Lynch kicked a wide each before Paul Kerrigan just booted the ball over the line to allow Marty Duffy to call time and see the Munstermen home with a rare two points from Ulster.

Minister Mallon said: “Just yesterday I confirmed MOT test centres would no longer be carrying out tests and that all vehicles eligible would be issued with a temporary exemption certicate . However, this could not be applied to four year old cars and taxis due to legal requirements. “I am pleased to confirm that following signicant work by my officials, I am now able to put arrangements in place to ensure four year old cars can get back on the road,given the ongoing health advice, the journey to be made is essential. googletag.cmd.push “From tomorrow, four year old cars will be given a TEC for six months from the date that their MOT test should have been due. This will allow the vehicle to be taxed and driven on the road. Issuing the certicates will take some time but the exemption will automatically apply from the due date. “The PSNI has agreed to our request that given these exceptional circumstances, where PSNI detects a vehicle without a valid MOT certicate, it will in suitable cases, exercise its discretion under the law, in circumstances where there is no identied risk to public safety. It is important that drivers realise that they are responsible under the law for the roadworthiness of their vehicle at all times.” googletag.cmd.push The Minister continued that she and officials are continuing to urgently explore options to support taxis at this dficult time. “For taxis which require PSV tests, new regulation and legislation needs to be put in place to allow the legal issuing of Temporary Exemption Certicates and,despite best efforts, this is taking longer to resolve. However, I want to reassure taxi drivers that we are working urgently on options to help them at this dficult time. I recognise the taxi industry is being hard hit by this public health and economic crisis. I also am working with Executive colleagues and pushing hard for more support from the UK Government for the self-employed. Protecting drivers and the public from the serious impact of COVID- is my priority.” Alastair Ross, Head of Public Policy for Northern Ireland at the Association of British Insurers, said: “Insurers recognise that this is worrying time for everyone and will take a pragmatic view. They will not penalise customers for something that is entirely out of their control and where motorists with an MOT exemption certicate request a quote, they will not be prejudiced by their lack of a valid MOT certicate. This applies regardless of whether they wish to renew with their existing insurance provider or are looking to take out a policy with a dferent insurer. “Insurers do, however, expect that motorists comply with their legal obligation to keep their vehicle in a roadworthy conditionthey are driving it. Those affected by the ongoing MOT testing suspension should continue to service their vehicle and carry out basic checks such as looking out for brake wear, ensuring that all lights are working and that windscreen liquid and oil are at the correct levels.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Caitriacuteona Lagan, from Castledawson, won the U All-Ireland mandolin title at the  Fleadh in Drogheda and is usually found playing at a session every weekend. Due to the measures in place to curb the spread of coronavirus, however, she has ploughed her efforts into performing online and sharing much-needed positivity. Caitriacuteona told the County Derry Post that it was vital to keep people’s spirits up at this time. She said: “I think it’s very important to keep playing because it can cheer people up and help them to take their minds off things. It makes them feel better. googletag.cmd.push “It’s nice to keep children happy and, instead of all the technology, give them something  to do as well.” The -year-old recently posted a video of her playing a few tunes for the children of Kilronan Special School in Magherafelt. Her mother, Roisiacuten, said Caitriacuteona had a great fondness for the children at Kilronan, having held charity events and performed there before. She said: “After she won the All-Ireland, we didn’t really get a chance to play any events, so for her th birthday she wanted to have a big session. “We don’t have any connections with Kilronan or anything, but she had met a few children at sessions who went to it. googletag.cmd.push “She did a charity night and then was invited up to the school and the summer scheme, so she’s been up and they know her. “She decided, in order to keep her practice up, she would share some videos online. It’s a good way for her to practise and it’s good for her confidence too. One thing that Caitriacuteona will miss out on this year is the annual series of Fleadhanna – county, provincial and All-Ireland – which have had to be cancelled due to the coronavirus. She said: “I’m a wee bit disappointed because I love going to the festivals because the atmosphere is so good at them. “I’m using the time to catch up with my schoolwork, take my dogs for a walkI can, do a wee bit of painting, bake at some point, practise my music. “I play a few dferent instruments – banjo, mandolin, fiddle, guitar and piano.” Caitriacuteona’s mum Roisiacuten said that social media has been a godsend for the music community during this time. “At the minute it’s the only way people are able to connect. A lot of Caitriacuteona’s friends would be in the music scene, and she would be at sessions every week, so she’s missing that. “With the Fleadh not being on this year, there’s going to be a massive gap. We normally plan our whole year around the fleadh, so the music is great for everyone to keep spirits up.” Caitriacuteona is certainly helping to keep spirits up, and Roisiacuten said a few children had already been in touch via social media. “A wee boy this morning sent her a rainbow, so hopefully they keep coming and keep children and adults occupied.” You can keep up to date with Caitriacuteona’s videos via her Twitter and Facebook accounts.

The council today said there has been an increased pressure on its collections as a result of the current coronavirus crisis. A council spokesperson said: “Our refuse collection service continues to remain operational and we are seeing an increase in calls and queries relating to waste management and are currently looking at a bespoke COVID- waste response mechanism that could assist in dealing with this increased pressure on waste services. “This is currently being scoped out and in the interim period the public are being asked to work with Council to try not to put additional pressure on waste services during this emergency period.” googletag.cmd.push The council said people can help by doing the following: - Please leave your bins out for collection at an earlier time of am to allow crews to get around all households. - Please do not leave out black bags - Council cannot collect additional black bags left beside bins, please use the blue, black and brown bins provided appropriately, making sure to separate waste as usual according to recycling guidelines and dispose of waste responsibly. - You should have adequate bin capacity as long as you are not dumping unnecessary additional items. Please do not put additional pressure on Council waste services resources and staff during this emergency period. googletag.cmd.push To assist the council to limit the spread of the virus, they would encourage the public to • Clean the lids and handles of bins before and after collection. • Dispose of tissues and disposable cleaning wipes separately placing them in two plastic bags, tying and storing inside for  days before putting in the external black bin. • Place all food waste in compostable bags and ensure that they are tied before putting in your BROWN BIN. • Bring bins out either the night before their scheduled collection day or before am on collection day. • Park considerately so lorries can access streets to service bins.

I am also going to miss some of the teachers in our school as well. With a really strange week nearly up, I have to admit the schoolwork isn’t as bad as I thought it was first going to be. Jack Bredin F      When I heard we were going in lockdown I didn’t know what to expect. My first thought was you could not go out of the house except shopping for food. My mum and dad explained to me what lockdown meant. They explained that I could still go outside, but only for one form of exercise. So I choose to run. I feel sad that I am not going to have face to face contact with my friends but I’m lucky to have Wi and I talk to my friends daily. The positive side of lockdown is I get to spend more time with my two brothers and my sister. They are company and together we try to support each other with our home schooling. Lockdown is giving me a chance to help my mum and dad about the house and learn new skills like cooking, cleaning and building. My mum jokes this will make my future we happy! Alex Donnell F   Le under lockdown is very boring because I cannot see my friends or some of my family members. It is also not great because I cant go to school either and see my friends and teachers, but I can get out for some fresh air and I can get lots of things done around the house that I cant get done when I was at school. I do miss the fun at school and getting to see my friends but hopefully sometime soon we will come out of lockdown. Remember to wash your hands and stay at a social distance from each other when you are outside. Alex McMichael F   Social Distancing Le in the fast lane has had to stop We are only allowed out to exercise or shop Wash your hands is the golden rule Never thought Id say that Id miss school My brother’s crying because hes fed up My sisters cracking up with her laptop Everyone is trying to be kind Always keeping the vulnerable in mind Essential staff have had to work Home schooling is driving parents berserk I miss my Grandparents theyre the best At least I am giving their heads a rest It’s now we realise what is important to us No point huffing or puffing or causing a fuss My family is so important to me Just think in a few weeks we can be free For everyone out there please take care This virus could be lurking anywhere Corona Virus is a mystery But please remember we are making History! Jay Scott I   Le under lock down can be very boring but fun at the same time. I don`thave to wake up as early and get to sleep in a bit longer. Idon`t have to move around every half an hour to get to my next class. I can take my time in doing my work and don`t have to rush through everything. Sometimes it can get really annoying, how the time passes really slowly or being stuck in the house in general. Some days I do wish I could go back to school because the time flies by a lot quicker and the day does not feel as long. I have a lot more family time and get to spend more quality time with my sister. I also get to annoy my parents which I do anyway! Amelia Sinclair A   It is a very strange feeling not being able to leave the house, it’s like being imprisoned! I miss playing with my friends and being in school learning alongside them. I am spending more time in my bedroom at my desk working on schoolwork which can feel boring and hard work as I can find learning a challenge! However, being away from school makes me appreciate the help and support I get in school from my teachers. On a positive note, being in lock down I don’t have to wake up as early to catch the bus. My schooling at home is more flexible and I can take a break when I want to. I have been using technology to communicate with my friends. We all arranged a video call together and it was great to see them and have a chat. Having to stay at home with only my family for company means we are spending more time together, eating together, playing together and enjoying our family PE lessons daily with Joe Wicks! We have a laugh together as we exercise. I am trying to stay positive and as a family we are trying to think of fun activities to do together like, going on a bike ride in the countryside, going on walks, do some baking, watching movies and at Easter time we are going to have Easter egg hunt in the garden. Stay positive everyone and keep safe. Isaac Morrison Year    Finally, we have the Taylor family from Limavady, who gave us an account of how children in the same house, but of dferent ages, are reading the situation.  Covid- My name is Harry and I’m a schoolboy during the coronavirus Covid- pandemic. I have to be home-schooled right now because the virus is running rampage. Personally, I think my mummy is a really good teacher. We have to use social distancing to stay safe in shops or pharmacies. This coronavirus outbreak is NOT scary in my eyes. I just think of it as a really bad cold that’s killing the elderly, so it should be called ‘The Elderly Killer’. It was just Monday night when lockdown was put into action in the UK. Also, being home-schooled has its pros and cons. Pros: getting to wear what you want activities every afternoon, sibling humour, your own back garden. Cons: full school day, digital PE. Harry Taylor, , Limavady  My Le Right Now Hello, my name is Molly and I am  years old. Right now there is an illness called coronavirus, also called Covid-. I am being home-schooled. I really hate having no friends in home-school, and no line points. I love still having a textbook, activities, doing PE and having Star of the Week. On Friday, Mummy had to pick up the packs from my school and Daddy works hard and late. Mammy teaches us and soon she might have to go in and look after key workers’ children. She said she might have to bring me and my brother and sister. Molly Taylor, , Limavady   Everything’s Not Normal Hi, my name is Emily and I am  years old. I am being home-schooled right now because of coronavirus Covid-. My mummy is a really good teacher, she makes really fun days for us. My teacher sent me home instructions to make a rain maker. I learnt about how the sun warms up the earth and the water goes up to the sky to make clouds. I am learning to do story writing. I did PE with Joe Wicks on YouTube and we made buns. I miss my swimming. I wrote letters to my friends because I miss them too. I can’t wait until it’s back to normal.

Emily Brizzell, , Crossroads PS, Kilrea  Year  pupils at Limavady High School also gave us their take on the current crisis...  It is strange working from home during lock down, because I don’t have to change classrooms every  minutes and I get to work in my dad’s office out the back of his house. I also get to spend more time with my family, my mum, dad, two sisters and two brothers. Every day I do Home Economics by helping to make dinner and I do Technology out in my dad’s workshop. I miss getting to see other people, my family and my friends, but I can still phone them at any time. I don’t have any homework in the evenings now because I have done it during the day. In the morning I write out my timetable for that day ahead and do PE on YouTube at :am. I miss going out for walks throughout the day, but I find other things to do. By Rebecca Hockley. I    Lockdown over the last week has definitely been one interesting experience. It’s one experience I hope we never have to repeat. One of the positive things about this is I get to watch a lot more TV as well as doing schoolwork during the day.

The health trust is also enhancing care at home packages for the vulnerable and elderly in the community.Mr Hazzard said the local community will be understandably concerned about the ldquodramatic changes to the hospital and that some may even be angry.ldquoDuring this global health emergency, we must put our faith and support in the expert health practitioners who are best placed to take these decisions, he continued.ldquoI welcome the public commitment from the South Eastern Trust that these are strictly temporary measures to meet the unprecedented challenges represented by the coronavirus pandemic and will not become a permanent reality.Mr Hazzard said that in the days ahead, many queries and issues will arise from the health trustrsquos decision, both from the public and those who work in the health and social care system.He declared: ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to engage with the health trust and other agencies to ensure there is public confidence in this radical approach.ldquoWith this in mind we have written to the Ambulance Service to ask that they urgently reassess their capacity to meet the subsequent needs of our local community on the back of this announcement.Mr Hazzard also appealed to the community to do all in its power to help and assist health and social care workers who find themselves at the frontline in the battle against COVID-.He added: ldquoThey are doing an incredible job in the most challenging of circumstances to keep us all safe. We must demonstrate real social solidarity in order to help and support them in the unprecedented crisis ahead..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 A\u0026E.jpg","title":"A%26E shut in Downe  ","story":"THE Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department has been temporarily closed as part of sweeping changes implemented by health chiefs preparing for the expected surge in coronavirus cases.The department closed on Monday morning with critical care staff and some equipment relocated to the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as part of a radical overhaul of services to cope with the global pandemic.The day procedure unit, outpatients department and minor injuries service at the Downpatrick hospital have also been closed, but the critically important GP out-of-hours service remains operational.Inpatient wards and acute mental heath and psychiatry services for the elderly remain open, as does the hospitalrsquos midwery-led unit, but no births are being allowed to take place for the time being.The South Eastern Trust said that as the organisation prepares ldquofor the biggest challenge it has ever faced it needs to reshape its hospitals and other services on a temporary basis to maximise its ability to ldquomanage the surge in demand for services due to COVID-.While local politicians have reluctantly accepted the closure of several key services at the Downe as part of a reconfiguration plan, they say public and private assurances from senior health trust officials that the changes are temporary must be honoured and all services fully restored when the crisis is over.News of the closure of the Downersquos emergency department and other services came ahead of confirmation that the Downpatrick hospital is one of  locations across the Province which has been designated as a primary care COVID- assessment centre which is expected to open before the end of the week.The new centre mdash designed to help manage the expected increase in coronavirus cases in the community mdash will allow patients who are showing symptoms of the virus to be separated from those with non COVID- conditions.Health chiefs insist that the new service is ldquoessential to ensure that vital GP services can be maintained over the coming weeks and months with minimum disruption.The new centre is not a testing facility and is only there for patients who are unwell and suspected of having the virus and require medical attention. Patients will not be able to report directly to the centre without being referred by their own GP or the Downersquos out-of-hours service.In addition, patients attending the centre will receive appropriate treatment, assessment and,necessary, onward referral to hospital.The new centre is designed to allow GPs and health and social care staff to work together in a suitable clinical environment and to plan what is best for the inidual in terms of treatment and any additional care they need.Defending the decision to close a number of services at the Downe Hospital, the South Eastern Trust says that each of its hospitals and services has a vital role to play in the fight against COVID-.ldquoWe must now make changes to some services in all of our hospitals to prepare for the additional critical care services needed and to achieve the best possible outcomes for our patients, it said in a statement.ldquoWe must deploy our staff and resources to best position us to provide the critical care which will be required for our local populations and to give our staff the essential training they need in order to equip them as much as possible for the challenge ahead.The health trust says that it needs to ensure that its staff can be as prepared as possible to help fight the impact of COVID-.The statement continued: ldquoRetraction of the most acute services from some sites, in a planned manner, is the best way to support our entire patient population and gives our staff the best chance to prepare for and manage the challenges and pressures upon us.ldquoThe Downe Hospital will play a vital role as part of the hospital network in responding to this crisis, particularly through the provision of inpatient services and through working alongside primary care to enable as many patients as possible to be cared for at home.Health chiefs say they believe it is imperative to respond now to provide the local community with the best possible outcomes and also to support staff as best it can.The health trust says it recognises the importance and value of all its sites and services within its communities.The statement adds: ldquoThe Trust would like to assure the community that changes made over the coming weeks and months are solely part of the effort to meet and manage the challenges presented by COVID-, the scale of which we have never faced before.ldquoAll service changes will continue to be reviewed and monitored, with the intention to fully restore services to normal as soon as possible. Every one of us has a role to play in the fight against coronavirus. We urge the public to help us protect themselves and others by staying at home and following all advice.Health chiefs say that with the situation rapidly changing plans must continue to be flexible and have asked for everyonersquos commitment and support ldquoduring these most dficult times..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Call on public to tidy up dog mess  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has called on dog owners across the district to clean up after their pets.Rowallane politician Kathryn Owen expressed particular concern about the issue in Saintfield, describing the area between the townrsquos health centre and pharmacy as ldquodisgustingrsquo.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, particularly to children, as the faeces includes roundworm eggs which become infectious after about three weeks and can remain so for up to two years.Just one pile of dog dirt can contain a million roundworm eggs and can lead to stomach upsets, throat infections, asthma and, in some cases, blindness in humans.Given the ongoing battle to contain the deadly coronavirus, Cllr Owen said the last thing needed is a battle against another disease.She said that with many more people at home and likely to remain so for the next few weeks, the number of dog owners taking their pets for a walk will increase.ldquoWe donrsquot have the same level of street cleansing being done at the moment as Newry, Mourne and Down Council is operating with skeleton staff, explained Cllr Owen.ldquoI am appealing to dog owners to take waste bags with them and please clean up after their pets. We are trying to fight onedisease, we donrsquot need to fight another one.Pointing to the disgusting state of the footpath which links the health centre at the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield with a pharmacy in nearby Main Street, Cllr Owen appealed to dog owners to be more considerate ldquoso everyone can enjoy thewelcome breath of fresh air with the pets.Her concern comes two weeks after another Rowallane councillor, Billy Walker, urged the local authority to press ahead with a plan to arm enforcement staff with body cameras in a bid to help address the districtrsquos dog fouling and fly-tipping issues.The move mdash along with using CCTV cameras to help identy offenders mdash is currently being examined by local authority officials.Last year, an enforcement action plan to tackle the dog dirt problem was agreed by the local authority which is also working with the Dogs Trust to promote responsible pet ownership across the district to reduce dog fouling.Cllr Walker said elected representatives have been ldquoinundated with complaints from ratepayers about the dog fouling issue and reaffirmed that he is keen for existing legislation to be strengthened to deal with offenders.He also cautioned against painting all ratepayers with the same brush as there are many who clean up after their pets.ldquoWe clearly need an action plan to deal with issues which are a blight on our district, he declared.ldquoI have consistently called for law breakers to be lsquonamed and shamedrsquo and council officials are seeking legal advice on such a move and any implication doing this would have on data protection legislation, said the Rowallane councillor.He added: ldquoEveryone has a responsibility and a duty of care to make sure they clean up after their pets. Dog dirt is not only unsightly but poses a health risk to young children in particular.ldquoIf people break the law they should be heavily fined and named and shamed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Singer.jpg","title":"Castlewellan singer becomes online sensation  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN grandfather has penned a song in praise of the selfless effort made by NHS workers during the COVID- pandemic.Terry Cowan has become a Facebook sensation during the lockdown with his performances of popular Irish songs.The traditional musician and singer wrote the song, Our Teamrsquos Thatrsquos Dressed in Blue, with one of his daughters very much in mind as shersquos a nurse.So far the ballad has racked up more than , views on social media.Terryrsquos Facebook fame began when he performed several songs on St Patrickrsquos Day ndash and itrsquos been growing ever since.The -year-old businessman says therersquos a growing demand for emigration songs from people who are apart from their sons and daughters.Terry, who runs Financial Directions and Property Directions in his home town, said his new found fame came about due to feeling bored on St Patrickrsquos Day when he was self-isolating at home with his we Patricia.ldquoThis has blown out of all proportion, to be honest, I did not understand the power of social media, said Terry.ldquoI was bored out of my brains on St Patrickrsquos Day and my we, Patricia, suggested that I record a couple of songs on Facebook and thatrsquos what I did. I chose Three Leafed Shamrock and If We Only Had Old Ireland Over Here because they mentioned shamrocks and I got , views in  hours.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in .

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

We fully recognise the importance of testing to our staff and that is why they are a key target group when it comes to testing.”Tests – mostly aimed at high-risk groups such as NHS staff – will soon be in place at MOT centres and other sites such as Belfast’s Odyssey Arena.Under pressure from Sinn Fein today, Mr Swann told Stormont’s Health Committee he is “pushing on extensively with our testing capabilities”, using laboratories across government, universities and commercial provision being sourced centrally with the UK including Randox.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We gave management a week to respond but we have received no response.“The UK government has provided  percent compensation for the costs of leave to employers, while sales revenues for foodstuffs are very sharply up.“This refusal by Moy Park bosses is already causing deep resentment among workers,” Mr McKeever concluded.However, a spokesperson for Moy Park refuted the claims and said “We see our team as Food Heroes, who are working harder than ever to keep food production moving at this critical time.“Over the last number of weeks, we have been working tirelessly to ensure staff are safe and are recognised for their hard work. “We have measures in place to protect all team members, including those who are extremely vulnerable and front-line workers. “Those colleagues who have been contacted by the NHS to stay at home due to their medical condition will receive a minimum of % of their basic contractual pay while they shield and care for themselves. “We completely refute any suggestion that we are focused on profits over employee wellbeing. “This is a dficult time for us all and it is important that the Northern Ireland food industry shows that it can play its part in feeding the nation as this crisis unfolds.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

He added: “I have also been in contact with Irwin’s Bakery and I am now receiving some their over produced products on a weekly basis.“I have distributed essentials all over Portadown, along with the aid of Lidl Portadown and the Flower Bowl International, Armagh.“I have already been in contact and delivered personally to a lot of elderly and vulnerable residents across Portadown in this past few days.“It is hard to get food donations in to keep up with the demand which is why I have set up this Just Giving page to anybody that would like to donate a small amount.”He went on to say: “Every £ goes a long way in one of my donation boxes so I don’t have to rely on donations as much.“You are not obliged to donate but every penny counts as I want to get out to as many elderly as I possibly can.”He also promised:“All extra money that is left over will be donated to the Children’s Hospice.”Speaking to the Portadown Times on his motivation for starting the community effort he said “I wanted to help the community, I saw a lot of people going out and just buying for themselves.“I’ve been to a lot of houses and I’m getting plenty of stuff in. Lidl in Portadown have been phenomenal and Irwin’s Bakery have also assisted.”He added: “I’ve assisted over  people and the list I have goes on for page, after page.“I’m going to people in all dferent areas with elderly self isolating.”Tristan manages to get out every few days, when he’s off work and isn’t left with much spare time.He works a  hour week and in his spare time can be doing delivery runs up to  hours a day.He said the people he was helping were really appreciative, some had cried with gratitude.Tristan also takes great care in terms of hygiene and infection control, using hand sanitiser before and after every visit, setting the food deliveries at the door and stepping back.And for Tristan those measures aren’t just about protecting himself and those he is helping but also his dad who suffers from COPD.If you would like to donate to Tristan’s efforts see his Just Giving page, www.justgiving and search PortadownUnite. \"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1585834314058.jpg--coronavirus__37_people_in_fermanagh___omagh_have_tested_positive.jpg?158583431400","title":"coronavirus  people in fermanagh omagh have tested positive ","story":"THERE are now  confirmed cases of Covid- in the Fermanagh and Omagh District Council area, new statistics show.As of am today , there have been  confirmed cases reported and sadly  people have now lost their le, up six from Wednesdays figures.The Public Health Agency says there have been  tests carried out for the virus in the past  hours, with a further  people testing positive.

Its no secret that MOT centres and the SSE Arena are among the options being pursued by the HSC system as staff testing sites.Staff testing numbers are expanding and will continue to do so as rapidly as possible. I fully understand the frustration that we have not been able to scale up testing numbers more quickly.This is not down to a lack of will or action. There are signicant challenges including laboratory and staffing capacity and the unprecedented levels of global demand for testing reagents and swabs.I want to make clear that we have been in contact with local company Randox over the past number of days regarding its testing product. We have been informed by Randox that its production line is fully geared towards the NHS as a whole and NI will receive a share of that.However, we will also continue to explore procuring testing products separately from NHS wide arrangements. We do not want to be dependent on one source for these products.Mr Swann stressed: I am confident we will make signicant progress on staff testing in the days ahead. But I want to be totally frank about the pressures that exist. If there were quick fixes available, I would certainly have used them.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_afebcfbfa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_edbbadaabf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
