These showbiz highs, and lows, we owe to Sam Cowell.The highest-paid singing star of his day, he had songs known the world over, including the innocent-sounding Are You Good-Natured Dear? As his audiences knew full well, this was the stock greeting used by the prostitutes of the day sounding out any potential clients.         Music-hall veterans specialised in double-entendre, with suggestively titled songs like A Little of What You Fancy Does You Good!, and Pulling My Rhubarb Out. These showbiz highs, and lows, we owe to Sam Cowell. Pictured is music hall artist Marie LloydThese numbers went down a storm at the predecessors of the music halls, hugely popular evenings of musical entertainment organised by pub landlords and known as ‘free and easies’.Designed to keep their customers drinking, they were often rowdy occasions with audiences showing their disapproval of bad acts by hurling whatever came to hand at the stage. This included bottles, old boots and even, in one case, a dead cat.But Sam Cowell had few hecklers. Born in London in 1820, the son of actor Joseph Cowell, he had been appearing on stage since he was nine and his comic appeal was such that, as one reviewer wrote, it is ‘impossible to convey by words the inexpressible mirth which even his silence creates’.         Actress and male impersonator Vesta TilleyIn 1852 he was chosen to head the bill at the opulent pleasure palace that was London’s first purpose-built music hall, a 2,000-seat venue brimming with gaslights and glittering chandeliers.Grandly named The Canterbury Hall, it was designed to attract the aspirational working classes, who regarded themselves as too respectable for ‘free and easies’ and it seems fitting that it was on Westminster Bridge Road, not far from the hospital where Simon Cowell, the modern-day King of Variety, was born a century or so later.The attractions off the main hall included a waxwork exhibition and a menagerie, and there were occasional spectaculars such as the legendary Charles Blondin walking a tightrope strung across the auditorium at balcony level.But these one-offs apart, The Canterbury Hall put the emphasis firmly on nightly evenings of variety with acts including ‘Paul Vandy, the Peerless Juggler’ and ‘Mr Harry Edson and his Musical Pug’. But none ever outshone Sam Cowell who could earn today’s equivalent of £8,000 a week for his twice-nightly appearances at The Canterbury.When he once refused to go on stage one night, because another act had performed one of his songs, a near riot followed.By 1875, there were nearly 400 music halls in London alone. Most, like the Canterbury, seated the audience at long communal tables so that they could eat and drink during the shows.They could also promenade around the auditorium freely, leading to accusations that music-halls were being frequented by ladies ‘of known character’ — for which read prostitutes. Neither were moral campaigners of the day impressed by the ribald material of stars like Marie Lloyd.         By 1875, there were nearly 400 music halls in London alone. Most, like the Canterbury, seated the audience at long communal tables so that they could eat and drink during the shows. Pictured is famous juggler Paul Cinquevalli‘I haven’t had it up for ages,’ she would complain to the audience, unfolding her umbrella. As one impresario observed, she could have made the 23rd Psalm sound indecent.In the end, though, what did for the music halls was the realisation that audiences were prepared to pay more for plush inidual seats. From the 1890s onwards, a new breed of variety theatres spread across Britain. And in 1912, these venues reached even greater heights of respectability when the Palace Theatre in London hosted the first Royal Command Performance, in the presence of George V and Queen Mary.Performers included ‘The Little Flying Devil’ Paul Cinquevalli, who could balance a man on one arm above his head while juggling three balls with the other hand, and male impersonator Vesta Tilley, both inheritors of the variety tradition which Sam Cowell did so much to promote.Cowell did not live to see such acceptance. Broken by overwork, and drinking a bottle of brandy a day, he died in Bournemouth in 1864, aged 44, leaving a wife and nine children.But although his name is largely forgotten, his legacy is still with us and that would surely prompt even his curmudgeonly 21st-century counterpart to give him the most enthusiastic of Golden Buzzers. Palaces Of Pleasure: How The Victorians Invented Mass Entertainment by Lee Jackson is published by Yale University Press at £20. "},{"url":null,"title":"Actors look surprise turn horror girlfriend makes unannounced visit","story":" While he takes his time a woman can be seen running from the room and his girlfriend excitedly waits for him to emerge.A man says: \u0027Paul, can you come out please.\u0027Walking out of the door Paul looks around to see why he is being called.Suddenly he does a double-take as he spots his girlfriend and a look of shock appears on his face.Although the look of shock almost appears to turn to horror as she runs forward for a hug, last night the couple contacted MailOnline to say everything was fine.

The blight is particularly evident on the west side of O’Connell Street with a proliferation of amusement arcades, discount shops and derelict sites, one of which, beside the Carlton cinema, has been vacant for 40 years.German architect Friedrich Ludewig of international firm Acme has produced designs that envisage the restoration of historic street patterns, building lines and scale. Unlike the previous enclosed shopping centre proposal, the new plans are for an open scheme with a new pedestrian street leading from O’Connell Street to Moore Street, opening to a large public square in the centre of the development.A second “pocket square” will be located at the southern end of the site at the junction of Moore Lane and Henry place, currently used only as service streets for Moore Street and Henry Street, and largely marked by derelict buildings.The art deco-style Carlton cinema, which opened in 1936 and closed in 1994, and has since been proposed for various uses including a national conference centre and then a new site for the Abbey Theatre, will have its facade restored.However, it will not have a new lease of life as a cinema, and will instead be used for retail, most likely for the flag-ship store of the development.A cinema will however be located in the northwestern part of the site, behind Conway’s pub on Parnell Street, a protected structure which will be restored and used as barrestaurant.The vacant lot beside the cinema is to be the new location of an underground Link Station for O’Connell Street. This station was previously planned for the middle of the street, but the The National Transport Authority announced in March it was moving the stop to the Carlton site to avoid traffic disruption on O’Connell Street.A new residential element has been added to the scheme, but at just 2,000sq m, compared with 23,500sq m of retail, 31,500sq m of office space and a 4,700sq m hotel, it is not likely to add significantly to the city’s stock of apartments, said Green Party Cllr Ciarán Cuffe.“It is disappointing that the residential component represents only 2,000sq m of the 90,000sq m site. It would be more appropriate to provide for one-third of the proposal to be residential. This would provide ‘eyes on the street’ and assist in tackling the housing crisis.”However, Mr Cuffe said he would have “cautious welcome” for the scheme which appeared “less invasive than previous proposals and retains more of the buildings in the surroundings of Moore Street”.Hammerson said it wants to “restore the unique character and vibrancy” of the Moore Street markets and will “respect and enhance street market trading” in consultation with the stall holders and Dublin City Council.It also wants to create a 1916 “historical trail” though the site which will “commemorate the 1916 Easter Rising events and locations on site”. The State has plans to redevelop 14-17 Moore Street as a 1916 Rising Commemorative Centre. Hammerson will refurbish 10 Moore Street, and the facades of other pre-1916 buildings. Last year the Court of Appeal overturned a declaration that buildings on and around Moore Street, part of the Hammerson site, constituted a national monument following a case taken by the State.While the plans are at “concept stage” and the inidual buildings have yet to be architecturally designed, the master plan presents a striking image in the use of a canopy of tall lily-pad-like structures to shelter the new pedestrian street from the elements, which funnel rain internally, while maintaining an open feel to the street."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3879217.1556827437!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"revamp of o connell street and moore street unveiled","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe facade of the old Carlton cinema will be restored, though it will be used for retail and the cinema relocated to Moore Lane.

How long will the North’s new MEPs sit? None of them know. They may never take their seats, if May can pass the withdrawal agreement through parliament before the start of July in fact, if she can get the deal passed in the coming weeks, the elections may not take place at all. Few things attest to the chaotic management of Brexit more than the confused electoral prospects. But few of them will bet on the prime minister’s success. Nobody would.So two of the sitting MEPs – Diane Dodds of the DUP and Martina Anderson of Sinn Féin – are seeking re-election, though with predictably different attitudes to the contest. Long-time sitting Ulster Unionist Party MEP Jim Nicholson, who occupies the North’s third seat, is retiring and the party is running the former Stormont minister Danny Kennedy. Nicholson was the last remaining member of a trio that included the late Ian Paisley and John Hume who represented the North in Brussels and Strasbourg for many years. His retirement will put the UUP on the back foot as it tries to hold the North’s third seat. The DUP and Sinn Féin seats are almost certainly safe but the last seat will be keenly contested by Kennedy, the SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, Jim Allister of the Traditional Unionist Voice party and Naomi Long of the Alliance. Poll topperLast time out in 2014, Sinn Féin’s Anderson topped the poll with more than 25 per cent of the vote, winning on the first count with almost 160,000 votes. She can afford to drop a lot of votes and still be re-elected.Dodds came second with just under 21 per cent of the vote and had to wait until the elimination of Allister to put her over the quota. Her surplus in turn pulled Nicholson over the line. But such a productive – from a unionist perspective – order of elimination cannot be guaranteed this time. If the SDLP can take some Sinn Féin votes and stay ahead of the Alliance – which transferred heavily to the party last time – it could be in a position to pip a weaker UUP candidate.That could work the other way, too, of course. The Alliance – whose leader and candidate Long was the most popular politician in the North in a recent poll – could stay in the race and benefit from an SDLP elimination. Either way, the SDLP and the Alliance represent a clear and present danger to the UUP seat. Once Thursday’s local elections are out of the way, the European contest will move centre stage in the North’s politics, running parallel to the all-party talks on reviving the power-sharing institutions which are due to begin next week.The background soundtrack to the election campaign will be the cacophony of uncertainty about Brexit emanating from Westminster. How the Brexit issue affects the election campaign, and the choices voters make on May 23rd, is the biggest uncertainty in this election. The behaviour of remain-minded unionist voters, in particular, will be decisive.

Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development and a time during which a child\u0027s habits are formed.The recommendations go much further than recent guidance from the UK\u0027s chief medical officers.This recommended a break from screens every two hours for all children. It also said phones should be banned from meal times and overnight. At a glance | WHO guidelines on physical activity for childrenThe guidance, which will be launched at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow this weekend sets out different advice for children of different ages, up to the age of five. It stresses the importance of avoiding sedentary screen time, in a bid to ensure children get sufficient exercise. One in five children in England are overweight or obese by the time they start primary school, rising to one in three by the time they leave. But some experts said parents were being given conflicting advice based on limited evidence. In January the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health shied away from recommending a limit, but said children should not be exposed to screens for at least an hour before bedtime. Tim Smith, Reader in Cognitive Psychology, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, said: “In recent months UK parents of 0- to five-year-olds and early-years practitioners have been bombarded with conflicting recommendations and guidelines about how and whether they should be managing their children\u0027s screen time and sedentary behaviour, e.g. from the RCPCH and Chief Medical Officers.“The release of new WHO guidelines does not help to clarify the situation, as its specific recommendations with regards to \u0027sedentary screen time\u0027 and their negative impacts on physical, cognitive and psychosocial health are, by its own admission based on \u0027moderate to very low-quality evidence\u0027.Duty of Care CampaignLocal Elections results 2019: Who won in your local council area and how the vote maps out nationally Cyclone Fani makes landfall in India threatening huge destructionRuth Davidson blocks Boris Johnson from Scottish Tory conferenceComment: The Williamson affair exposes serious dysfunction in the British establishmentBritain needs a \u0026#39national deal\u0026#39 with Labour on Brexit to stop future governments dismantling it, says Rory StewartVietnamese suspect in Kim Jong Nam murder is releasedThe press is free to report a leak -

Witnesses were able to provide two e-fit images of men who were seen visiting apartments in the resort on the pretence of collecting money for orphans.It was thought the criminals had been posing as charity collectors, but were also using the ruse to scope out apartments to burgle. Police issued a series of photo-fit images of suspects they said may have been hanging around the Algarve during that period and the pictures featured on a BBC Crimewatch appeal. Stolen to order for childless coupleWith no evidence to suggest Madeleine is dead, it has long been suggested that she may have been stolen to order by criminals acting on behalf of a wealthy childless couple.Witnesses claimed to have seen suspicious characters around the resort in the days before her disappearance, who could have been acting as spotters, searching for a child that fitted the requirements.There were a number of sightings of suspicious blond-haired men who were seen hanging around the Ocean Club resort in the days leading up to Madeleine\u0027s disappearance.Witnesses also claimed to have seen two blond men on the balcony of a nearby apartment, just two doors from where the McCanns were staying. They were said to have been speaking Dutch or German, leading to appeals being broadcast in both of those countries.The head of the investigation at the time DCI Andy Redwood, said: “Madeleine McCann’s disappearance does, on one reading of the evidence, have the hallmarks of a pre-planned abduction. That would undoubtedly have involved reconnaissance and so we are really keen to understand who these people are.” Kate and Gerry McCann being interviewed for the BBC as they mark 10 years since their daughter disappeared. Abducted by a paedophile gangPolice have also been forced to explore the possibility that Madeleine was abducted by a sex attacker who had been operating throughout the Algarve for several years.Police identified nine sexual assaults and three near misses on British girls aged between six to 12 in the three years before Madeleine went missing.  In one case from 2005, a ten-year-old girl was assaulted in an apartment Praia da Luz, close to the spot from where Madeleine vanished.An Irish family who had been on holiday in the resort in May 2007, reported seeing a man carrying a child around Madeleine\u0027s age towards the beach at around 10pm on the night she disappeared. Martin Smith from Drogheda, Co Louth in the Republic of Ireland, gave the description to Portuguese police at the time but little was done with the information.Disappearance of Madeleine McCannIn 2008 he met with private detectives working for the McCann family and produced an e-fit image of the man he had seen. But the image was not placed in the public domain at the time because it was thought Madeleine had been abducted almost an hour earlier.In 2013 police admitted that the original timeline was probably wrong and the image featured in a Crimewatch appeal.Another theory that has emerged is that Madeleine was not abducted from the apartment, but was actually snatched or came to harm after wandering off.The three-year-old was asleep in the ground floor holiday flat, with her one-year-old twin brother and sister Sean and Amelie.Search for Madeleine McCann in picturesHer parents Kate and Gerry were having dinner with a group of friends at the complex\u0027s Tapas restaurant around 50 yards away. While the front door remained locked, the patio doors were left open so the parents could slip in an out easily to check on the children\u0027s welfare.It has since been suggested that Madeleine may have woken during the evening and got up to go and look for her parents. Had she negotiated her way out of the apartment - which was the last one on the block - she could have wandered into the main road and been hit by a driver who then panicked.Alternatively she could have then been snatched by an abductor.  But for the theory to be plausible, Madeleine would have had to close the heavy sliding patio doors behind her, something which seems unlikely.Taken to North Africa by people traffickersThere have been almost 9,000 supposed sightings of Madeleine McCann around the world since her disappearance 10-years ago.One theory that emerged was that the three-year-old was targeted by people smugglers who whisked her away to nearby Spain and then across the Strait of Gibraltar into North Africa.Gangs known to be operating in the region could have concealed her easily and then moved on to avoid detection. Investigators working on the case have explored numerous leads in Morocco, including several sightings which initially looked very promising.In 2007 just months after Madeleine disappeared, a tourist took a photograph of a group of women in Tangiers wearing traditional North African dress and carrying a blonde girl who bore a striking similarity to the missing youngster.However, the group was subsequently tracked down and the girl was identified as the five-year-old daughter of a local farmer.Morocco and neighbouring North African countries have remained key areas in the ongoing investigation.Local elections 2019: Tories suffer heavy losses at local elections amid Brexit anger -

Growth of output and new orders slowed, leading to job cuts for the third time in the past four months.“The trend in new export business was especially weak, as high stock holdings at clients and slower global economic growth led to reduced demand from key markets such as the European Union, the USA and China.”Brexit stockpiling continued to support production output as Britain\u0027s exit day remains uncertain, with a new deadline of October 31 to come up with a deal.Manufacturing employment declined for the third time in the past four months during April, with job losses attributed to “natural wastage, improved efficiency and workforce restructuring”.“Companies plan to use new product launches, new technologies and improved marketing strategies to drive growth forward in the coming months.“However, Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh on plans, as some firms remain concerned about future growth prospects and the likely impact on output and demand from the unwinding of inventory positions later in the year,” Mr Dobson added.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mike Ashley\u0027s Sports Direct has appionted an employee director The Government’s “world leading package of corporate reforms” have certainly generated some world leading excuse making on the part of Britain’s biggest companies.\u0026nbspWhen she entered Number 10 Downing Street, Theresa May looked like she might be poised to do something bold and radical on behalf of employees by giving them a voice in the boardroom, only to back pedal in the face of an intensive lobbying campaign.The end result was that companies were given a couple of cop outs. As an alternative to appointing employee directors, they could instead designate an existing non executive director to pretend to care about\u0026nbspworkers interests or set up an employees’ advisory panel.\u0026nbspTheresa May’s plan to put workers on boards comes from EUMike Ashley’s Sports Direct weighs up £61m Debenhams deal\u0027Mission led\u0027 Legal \u0026amp General has mission to thwart employee directorsA big problem\u0026nbspat the outset is that the measures were introduced via Britain\u0027s corporate governance code.\u0026nbspIt gives businesses\u0026nbspcarte blanche to ignore anything they don’t like as long as they say why they’re doing so under the principle of “comply or explain”.\u0026nbspWhen the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, whose members oversee £230bn of investments, conducted a survey of companies to find out how they were dealing with the new rules, nearly one in five (18 per cent) said they planned to ignore them. That’s where the world leading excuse will come\u0026nbspin.Of those planning to comply, just five per cent\u0026nbspsaid they would\u0026nbspappoint employee directors, with nearly three quarters (73 per cent) opting instead to hand the job to\u0026nbspexisting non executive directors. The remainder chose to convene advisory panels.\u0026nbspA look at the way some companies are handling the latter two suggests that they\u0027re treating the new requirements with rather less seriousness than you would hope.\u0026nbspMelrose, which controversially took over engineering group GKN a while back, has, for example, filled its panel not with workers but with the HR directors of the various manufacturing businesses it owns. \u0026nbspMediclinic, which operates private healthcare clinics in Southern Africa, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, has, meanwhile, appointed its former CEO Danie Meintjes to speak for employees in his new role as a non executive director. It’s hard to imagine a less appropriate person to serve as the voice of its workers than a company’s former boss.\u0026nbspThe LAPFF, which commendably supports reform, described its overall findings as “particularly disappointing given that no respondent to the survey considered the changes would be negative for the market or their company”.The sort of cynicism it has unearthed is, however, by no means true of all British companies. Transport operator FirstGroup has, for example, had an employee on its board for 30 years. I’ve talked to the group about its experience of this in the past and the response has been extremely positive.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

That’s right, Sports Direct.

Sadly, it may take more than time to drag corporate Britain into the 21st century and improve the low esteem in which it\u0026nbspis held by the public at large. \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s just that a fluffy bunny is not the sort of thing that can be relied upon to keep the wolves from the door for long.\u0026nbspThe numbers Coupe unveiled contained much of what the City, which doesn’t tend to look much further than the end of its own nose, tends to coo over.\u0026nbspSainsbury’s boss favoured profit over logic in the Asda mergerCMA slays Sainsbury\u0027s, Asda attempt to create supermarket Thanos Sainsbury\u0027s £12bn merger with Asda blocked by regulatorUnderlying profits - which strip out all sorts of nasties such as the £48m blown on the failed Asda experiment - were up 7.8 per cent at £692m and so (crucially) was the idend. Debt was down, ditto underlying costs.\u0026nbspIt was better than analysts had expected and lit a fire under the shares, which were the biggest gainers on the FTSE 100 early on.\u0026nbspBut all those apparently fresh looking numbers need a little context. Let’s start with the shares. They’ve been bouncing around at near 30 year lows. Set against that, a 4 per cent boost to the price is like scoring a consolation goal in injury time to ease the pain of being down by five.\u0026nbspThen there’s the “underlying” number Sainsbury’s\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspso keen for people to focus their attention on. It excluded\u0026nbspfully £396m worth of supposedly “one off” items.\u0026nbspIn addition to the money the company blew on the deal, Sainsbury’s listed\u0026nbspcosts relating to guaranteed minimum pensions, retail restructuring, “Sainsbury’s Bank transition”, and the integration of Argos into the business.\u0026nbspAfter factoring them all in,\u0026nbspprofits\u0026nbspslumped by 41.6 per cent to just £239m. That’s a lot less fluffy than the underlying number Coupe was so keen to show off.\u0026nbspIt has risen for two years in a row but pre tax profits have been down for three.

Kantar’s authoritative retail survey has shown the group consistently losing market share. Sainsbury’s complains that it doesn’t include Argos and general merchandise in its numbers but the same is true for, say, Tesco, which has been doing a lot better when it comes to what Kantar does include.Beauty is in the eye of the beholder when it comes to corporate results and the City decided it fancied these ones despite the issues I’ve raised.

Growth of output and new orders slowed, leading to job cuts for the third time in the past four months.“The trend in new export business was especially weak, as high stock holdings at clients and slower global economic growth led to reduced demand from key markets such as the European Union, the USA and China.”Brexit stockpiling continued to support production output as Britain\u0027s exit day remains uncertain, with a new deadline of October 31 to come up with a deal.Manufacturing employment declined for the third time in the past four months during April, with job losses attributed to “natural wastage, improved efficiency and workforce restructuring”.“Companies plan to use new product launches, new technologies and improved marketing strategies to drive growth forward in the coming months.“However, Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh on plans, as some firms remain concerned about future growth prospects and the likely impact on output and demand from the unwinding of inventory positions later in the year,” Mr Dobson added.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.The monetary policy committee\u0026nbspsaid in the minutes to its rate-setting meeting: “GDP is expected to have grown by 0.5 per cent\u0026nbspin the first quarter, in part a reflection of a larger-than-expected boost from companies in the United Kingdom and the European Union building stocks ahead of recent Brexit deadlines. That boost is expected to be temporary, however, and quarterly growth is expected to slow to around 0.2 per cent in the second quarter.”Stock-building during the period had been higher than expected, with UK manufacturing output rising markedly during the first two months of\u0026nbsp2019. Imports of goods from EU and non-EU countries both rose by around 3 per cent\u0026nbspduring the quarter. The pound was broadly flat after the rate announcement, which was in line with traders’ expectations.Erik Norland, senior economist at CME Group, said: “Both the pound and UK interest rates are still stuck in a tug of war between a strong employment market and wage growth, which ordinarily would pull them higher, and a soft housing market, weak exports and falling consumer confidence, which are pulling in the opposite direction. \u0026nbsp“Mixed economic indicators, combined with the continuing uncertainty regarding Brexit, are keeping the BoE and markets on hold. That said, if parliament seals the deal to leave the European Union\u0026nbspit will likely send the pound significantly higher and nudge interest rate expectations in the direction of further rate hikes later this year.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To create a positive proposition for a career in teaching the essential components include competitive pay, attractive and flexible working conditions, a healthy work-life balance, opportunities for career-long continuing professional development, and lower risk ways of holding schools to account.”Schools ‘haemorrhaging’ teachers with two in five planning to leaveAt the NAHT conference, members will vote on a motion calling on the government to restore the differentials between education pay grades and to push forward with plans for sabbaticals. \u0026nbspDamian Hinds, education secretary, will address hundreds of school leaders at their annual conference on Friday where he will ask them for their views on how to make funding arrangements for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities more effective.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “The education secretary has been clear that there are no great schools without great teachers. Despite there being more than 450,000 teachers – 11,900 more than in 2011 – with increasing numbers returning to the profession, it is his top priority is to make sure teaching remains an attractive and fulfilling profession.“That’s exactly why we published the Teacher Recruitment and Retention Strategy, which provides teachers with more early careers support and opportunities for flexible and part-time working, to ensure we continue to attract and retain more great teachers.“We are also ensuring teachers are fairly rewarded and recently announced a rise of up to 3.5 per cent for classroom teachers, funded by a £500m government grant, in addition to the tax-free bursaries worth up to £26,000 for trainee teachers in priority subjects.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.322 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.622 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” 922 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. 1422 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” “You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” 1722 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”1822 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” “Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 2022 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”2122 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 122 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.322 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.622 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” 922 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. 1422 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” “You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” 1722 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”1822 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” “Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 2022 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”2122 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” Having originally\u0026nbsppreviewed at Soho Theatre before its Edinburgh Festival debut in 2013, Fleabag – written by Waller-Bridge and directed by\u0026nbspVicky Jones – quickly won rave critical reviews.The show was later adapted into a television show, the second series of which premiered on BBC Three earlier this year.The first series, which centres on the eponymous character as she comes to terms with both a friend’s and her mother’s deaths,\u0026nbspearned Waller-Bridge a BAFTA Award for Best Female Comedy Performance.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab317 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive. At first, it seems as if this is low-key social realism in the Dardennes or Ken Loach mould, albeit set on the French Riviera. Gradually, though, we realise how stylised and theatrical his approach really is.” Geoffrey Macnab“Director Jon S Baird, whose previous film was scabrous Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, wrings every last drop of pathos he can from his material. This is very much a case of the tears of the clowns.” Geoffrey Macnab“Vice is bravura storytelling. McKay isn’t only taking us through Cheney’s life and career but is giving us a whistle stop tour through US politics from the Nixon administration almost right to the present day.” Geoffrey Macnab“Playing Lee Israel, McCarthy manages something very special: she makes a character who is odd, obnoxious, difficult and alcoholic seem lovable and even heroic. The rest of the world is at fault, not Lee.” Geoffrey MacnabGreen Book flatters the audience about its own good sense and tolerance. It deals with racism and homophobia but still has a fairytale, fantasy feel to it. Whatever humiliations Don endures on their road trip, we know no real harm will ever come to him as long as Tony is at his side.” Geoffrey Macnab“The golden age of bonkers horror movies is gloriously evoked by Netflix’s latest feature length presentation. Beginning as a satire of the arts world, Velvet Buzzsaw swiftly and gleefully descends into a savage splatter-fest, smeared in paint, viscera and garishly-bright blood.” Ed Power“Written by Ben Elton and directed by its star Kenneth Branagh, the film plays so fast and loose with the playwright’s final years that they needn’t have bothered fitting Branagh with a prosthetic nose – accuracy is clearly not the priority here.” Alexandra PollardThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the doomed progeny of a celebrated genius – brilliant but slightly stunted by the knowledge they will never live up to their predecessor.” Clarisse Loughrey“Nicolas Pesce’s sleek and stylish horror comedy is repulsive and funny by turns. In adapting Ryu Murakami’s cult novel, Pesce strikes just the right balance between humour and Grand Guignol-style shock tactics.” Geoffrey MacnabThe best moments here are remarkable. Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead. He’s an irrepressible figure with such an inbuilt sense of moral decency the film seems upbeat and optimistic, even at its darkest moments.” Geoffrey MacnabDoppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele’s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.Ralph Fiennes combines thriller elements with poetic flashbacks to ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev’s childhood and keeps a tight focus on the dancer. When he is most at risk, Nureyev makes decisions with his artistic future more in mind than his personal safety. As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the \u0027white crow\u0027 will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films. In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters. Tina is the innocent – a visionary who hardly understands her own powers but who can sense human venality and corruption wherever it appears.1717 Fighting with My FamilyCertain scenes feel very trite and predictable but the film gets you in a choke hold early on and won’t let you go. It is far more gripping than its subject matter might suggest. Who ever would believe a story about a wrestling family from Norwich could have quite such heart and resonance?“Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief.

Despite initial public disapproval and the threat of criminal charges and imprisonment, her\u0026nbspidea\u0026nbspstuck.\u0026nbspMartin Purdy\u0026nbspexplainsClick to followThe IndependentMs Leyel’s ballots helped set up Westfield War Memorial Village in Lancaster in the 1920s – it was a home for veteransIn December 1921, the public gallery of Marylebone Magistrates’ Court in London was filled with “fashionably dressed ladies’’ keen to hear the latest charges to be levied against a popular socialite called Hilda Leyel. In taking on such a well-connected member of British society, the prosecutors were playing with high stakes – and it was a roll of the dice that would ultimately result in the rules of charitable fundraising being changed for ever across the United Kingdom.The breaches of the Betting Act that\u0026nbspLeyel found herself charged with were all linked to a national lottery – one that by 1920 had already raised more than £250,000 to specifically help some of the 1.7 million disabled servicemen who had returned to home shores from the killing fields of the First World War.Billed as “golden ballots”, the lotteries were the first of their kind and the forerunners of the same National Lottery that continues to persuade so many of us to part with a smattering of our cash each week.\u0026nbspUnlike the modern lottery, all of the profits from Hilda Leyel’s ballots went to hospitals that specialised in the rehabilitation of the wounded of war, including prosthetic limbs, work retraining schemes and bespoke housing projects.\u0026nbspVery like the modern lottery, the winners could win life-changing prizes, from £25,000 in cash to strings of pearls – or a cow and an acre of land on which to graze it!\u0026nbspAt one of Leyel’s inaugural court hearings in April 1920, the newspaper reports of the day took great delight in pointing out that Lady Asquith, the wife of the prime minister that had taken Britain to war, had been among those present to support the accused. Furthermore, Lady Asquith was said to have shocked those present by laughing out loud when the prosecutor said that among the prizes had been the chance to dine at the Savoy Hotel in London for a week – “allowing the common chimney sweep the chance to experience the life of a Lord’’.How a British officer was worshipped as a god in 19th century IndiaWhile the society ladies of London may well have been amused by such a concept, the crown was not. Nevertheless, it did accept that the golden ballots were not the work of criminal masterminds and that none involved had personally gained from the enterprise.\u0026nbspThis was important as there were certainly some big reputations at stake. Among Leyel’s main supporters were Major-General Sir Geoffrey Feilding, who had served with distinction in the Boer War and successfully commanded an elite Coldstream Guards’ Division in the recent world war, as well as the Earl of Denbigh and Sir William Tyrrell, an assistant under-secretary of state at the Foreign Office.Ever-mindful of who they were dealing with, the prosecution remained at pains throughout to stress that it did not seek to question the honourable aims of those involved but simply wished to stop a precedent being set that would open the door to more ‘’unscrupulous’’ iniduals – people who might use such lotteries to ‘‘feather their own nests’’.In presenting Leyel with eight specimen charges, carrying a fine of £25 or three-months imprisonment each, they undoubtedly hoped that the socialite would opt to pay up and consign the enterprise to anecdote. They had, however, underestimated her fighting spirit.Created with Sketch.The best of The Independent\u0027s photography Show all 48Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protests

HarrisThe fall of the Berlin  Wall, 1989, by Brian HarrisA storm strikes Ascot on Ladies Day, 2000, by Tom PilstonAlbanians in Korce, 1990, by Barry LewisHilda Waughton had been born in London in 1880, the daughter of a schoolmaster from the Uppingham School in Rutland. As a child she had been a keen collector of herbs and flowers and nurtured an ambition to study medicine. However, a secondary passion for acting ultimately changed that – for it was while\u0026nbspacting with the Benson Troupe that she met a young Swedish nobleman called Carl Leyel, and before the century was out the teenager and her beau had married.The Leyels went on to have two sons, both of whom were thankfully still too young to serve when war broke out in the summer of 1914. However, Hilda’s role as an actress would bring her in to contact with many of the wounded of the conflict that was slowly tearing the world apart.In the pre-war years Hilda had been an honorary treasurer of the Actresses Franchise League (AFL) established to promote female enfranchisement and suffrage via acting, education and leafleting. During the war the AFL, which neither openly supported nor condemned militancy, put its work on hold and formed Women’s Theatre Camps Entertainments. The group performed at army camps and hospitals and it is presumed that it was as a result of this work that Hilda became introduced, and then fully committed, to the care of wounded servicemen. After the war had ended she came up with the concept of the golden ballots to ensure that such men could continue to receive the aftercare and support they so desperately needed.\u0026nbspLeyel in the 1920sThe sad reality is that successive post-war governments proved themselves far from willing to take adequate responsibility for the disabled of the recent war. While pensions had improved during the conflict, and a more centralised form of care had been established by the creation of a Ministry of Pensions, few historians would argue that the state did anything other than attempt to minimise its financial support. In many ways it was able to get away with this courtesy of the sympathy of the public for the large numbers of disabled men who were providing a highly evocative and visceral presence on the streets of so many communities. In fact, by the time of the Armistice on 11 November\u0026nbsp 1918, there were already 6,000 charities registered to support injured ex-servicemen.Nevertheless, as Britain rapidly found itself slipping into a post-war depression, and money became desperately tight for many households, it proved an ever-greater challenge for the charity sector to find ways to get the public to put its hand in its pocket. The old adage that charity begins at home\u0026nbsphad never been more prescient for families living on the breadline as unemployment levels hit record highs.\u0026nbspIn addition to the difficult economic situation, the sheer number of charities operating in Britain – which had doubled to around 36,000 as a direct result of the war – meant that fundraisers were being forced to become far more professional and innovative in order to stand out from the crowd and attract donations. Many of the charitable practices that we now accept as commonplace, from the concept of professional marketing campaigns to the introduction of bespoke charity shops, can be traced back to this period.The golden ballots were, however, a genuine masterstroke. The public could take part in these ballots knowing that their money was going to support a noble cause, while\u0026nbspalso offering them the chance to become personally enriched. It’s an approach that modern descendants of the ballots, including our own National Lottery, have continued to attempt to emulate with the majority of the public’s weekly stake going to support good causes, as well as arts and heritage projects, while a handful of lucky members of the public can win life-changing amounts.Such was the fame of Hilda Leyel’s ballots, footage of the chic looking socialite can still be found in the British Pathe film archive showing her arriving on the doorstep of unsuspecting members of the public to announce their windfalls. These films were aired in cinemas across Britain, describing\u0026nbspHilda as a “fairy godmother”, and highlighting the potential backlash the crown faced in prosecuting her.Indeed, the popularity of Hilda Leyel with the public may well have been key to her decision to plead ‘’not guilty’’ to the charges levied against her and instead opt for trial by jury. It was a gamble that ultimately paid off, and her subsequent victory in the High Court in 1922 ensured that ballots held solely to raise funds for charitable causes were, from this point forward, legal. The “golden\u0026nbsplady” had changed the face of charitable fundraising in Britain for ever, making her legacy among the most socially important of the First World War.Haig. Hilda was among the honoured guests seated on the village bowling greenDespite this, the coverage in the newspapers of the flagship trial and victory was mooted. It appears that the British media, perhaps reflecting the growing public mood at the time, was keen to draw a line under ‘’the war’’\u0026nbspand focus on the brave new world\u0026nbspinstead.Likewise, when the heroine of the golden ballots died in April 1957 there was even less fanfare. In fact, she had by that time become much better known as the founder of the Society of Herbalists, the proprietor of a chain of related stores called the Culpeper Shops, and as the author of numerous popular tomes on herbalism, including the highly influential The Perfect Picnic\u0026nbspand The Gentle Art of Cookery. Never one to shy away from a battle, she would go on to find herself at the forefront of the fight to ban synthetic fertilisers.How Brexit could end 20 years of peace in Northern IrelandPages from history: The secret suffering of Ceausescu’s babies‘Now I have this thing called life’: How I beat my eating disorderTo find any formal recognition of the First World War fundraising schemes of Hilda Leyel you have to visit Lancaster, the former county town of Lancashire and the home of a rather unique settlement for disabled ex-servicemen called the Westfield War Memorial Village. This community marks its centenary in July of this year, and among the 113 homes nestled behind its grand entrance gates are a collection of four conjoined properties bearing the name of “Leyel Terrace”.The naming of the properties was how the trustees of the Westfield charity thanked Hilda for hosting a second golden ballot on their behalf in the early 1920s. Without the huge amount of money raised – which at £20,000 was in the region of a million pounds at the time – the settlement could not have grown. The money would pay for dozens of new houses, essential utilities such as sewers and pavements and a nest egg to accrue interest that would help support the community in the fallow years to follow.Such was the scale of the financial input, the lead philanthropist behind the Westfield project, Herbert Lushington Storey, would state in a formal public address in 1926: “If I may be so bold as to say so ... I am afraid if it hadn’t been for the assistance of my friend Mrs Leyel we should not have got very far with the scheme.”Mandy Stretch, the present secretary of the charity that continues to run the community, is in no doubt about the vital contribution of Hilda Leyel. She says: “As a result of the huge amount of money Hilda raised, hundreds of ex-service personnel and their families around Britain were to benefit at the end of the First World War. It shouldn’t be forgotten that many continue to benefit today. We have residents living here who have fought in nearly every conflict since the First World War – from the D-Day landings in the 1940s through to recent wars in Afghanistan – who are living in properties that were paid for by Hilda Leyel’s second Golden Ballot.”The Westfield charity will this month unveil a new memorial in recognition of the vital role that philanthropy and charity have played throughout history in the care of Britain’s disabled of war. Needless to say, at the unveiling of the memorial, special mention will be given to Hilda Leyel, the mother of two, actress, suffragist and fundraiser who risked her reputation and liberty to leave a vital and lasting mark on the whole process.Dr Martin Purdy is the historian in residence at the Westfield War Memorial Village Lancaster and the co-author of such popular First World War books as ‘Doing Our Bit’ and ‘The Gallipoli Oak’.

And that really hurts. So it was really emotional knowing I’ve got to walk away.”Mr Kelly, who lives in Bermagui, New South Wales, launched a campaign to reclaim the shield in 2016 after he saw it had been loaned\u0026nbspto Canberra’s National Museum of Australia.\u0026nbspHe said he grew up listening to stories about his ancestors from the period of Britiain’s arrival in Australia, and traced his family tree to discover he is a direct descendent of the warrior who was killed. \u0026nbspThe dream now, he said, was to get it back home in time for the 250th anniversary of it being taken.He added the shield represents the\u0026nbspBritish colonisation of Australia, and how they “never respected us as human beings when they opened fire and took everything”.He said people at home were keen to learn about their roots and the shield was a major symbol of the past that could help teach them.\u0026nbspHow an Aboriginal approach to mental health is helping farmersAboriginal teen makes history for reaching Miss World Australia Finals“They’re all just asking me ‘When are they coming back? Can you bring them back yet?’”But he said the British Museum Act is one of the reasons why the institute is refusing to return the shield.\u0026nbspA report by Sarah Keenan,\u0026nbspsenior professor at Birkbeck Law School, claims the British Museum “changed its story” about the origins of the Gweagal Shield when a two-day workshop to “test the argument the shield was collected at Botany bay in 1770” led\u0026nbspparticipants to argue\u0026nbspit is not from Cook’s landing.\u0026nbspMr Kelly said repatriation was important in light of “all the stuff that’s happened in the past” and it would be a “huge moment in time to have the British Museum and others actually return things to the Aboriginal people because it would be a great step towards the healing process.”He added ancestral spears taken by Cook and his men at the same time\u0026nbspwere held at the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Cambridge\u0026nbsphe also viewed those privately last year.Mr Kelly’s claim to the artefacts has been backed by a motion passed in 2016 by New South Wales’ parliament, which acknowledged his clan as the shield’s rightful owners\u0026nbspAustralia’s Senate followed suit two months later. \u0026nbspAustralian historian Keith Vincent Smith told The Independent: “I can certainly say the Gweagal at Botany Bay are the rightful owners of the shield and spears taken from there by Joseph Banks and James Cook in 1770.” \u0026nbspIn a paper entitled Confronting Cook, Mr Smith describes how information about Cooman was passed down through generations, after\u0026nbspan Aboriginal woman’s account of what happened was documented in the 1840s.He said the shield is likely to be the same as the one seen in drawings from the time.Mr Kelly, who is visiting the UK for the fourth time in collaboration with pressure group BP Or Not BP? said he was amazed at what was on display at the British Museum.\u0026nbspDuring last year’s visit he said he took part in the group’s ‘British Museum Stolen Goods Tour’ to protest a controversial BP-sponsored exhibition of Iraqi artefacts. This week, he leads the group’s ‘British Museum Stolen Goods Tour: Colonialism, Carbon \u0026amp Cook” with speakers discussing “looted items” on display from\u0026nbspIraq, Palestine, Greece and Australia.\u0026nbspHe said: “For me, this tour is all about getting different cultures together because we’re all in it for that one cause. I think it’s a great opportunity for us to unite and to show the British People and British Museum there’s a real need for these items to be repatriated and we can make the world a better place if we did.”Created with Sketch.

The Museum looks forward to continuing these discussions.”National Museum of AustraliaOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We are talking about nothing less than the irreversible destruction of the environment within our lifetimes.”During the debate on the motion\u0026nbspenvironment secretary Michael Gove, who met with climate activists at Westminster on Tuesday, also said the government recognises “the situation we face is an emergency”, but stopped short of meeting Labour’s demands to officially declare one.High Court approves third runway at Heathrow despite climate crisisClimate activists describe Gove meeting as ‘less s*** than expected’Fight climate change on ‘war footing’ like defeat of Nazis, May toldSadiq Khan meets Extinction Rebellion protesters and pledges actionFracking tsar quits government post and blames eco activists“It is a crisis,” he added. “It is a threat that all of us have to unite to meet.”Mr Gove continued: “Five of the warmest years that this planet has endured have happened since 2010. The consequences for all of us are visible.“While statistics can sometimes be abstract and the impact can seem distant, we can all know that as inidual citizens and as parents that the next generation will face the consequences if we do no take action now to deal with climate change.”The cabinet minister also insisted the legislation will be introduced by the government “shortly” to ensure the UK has the “highest standards of environmental protection” as he claimed it would mark a “step change in how this country tackles the twin challenges of climate change and broader ecological degradation”.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.The monetary policy committee\u0026nbspsaid in the minutes to its rate-setting meeting: “GDP is expected to have grown by 0.5 per cent\u0026nbspin the first quarter, in part a reflection of a larger-than-expected boost from companies in the United Kingdom and the European Union building stocks ahead of recent Brexit deadlines. That boost is expected to be temporary, however, and quarterly growth is expected to slow to around 0.2 per cent in the second quarter.”Stock-building during the period had been higher than expected, with UK manufacturing output rising markedly during the first two months of\u0026nbsp2019. Imports of goods from EU and non-EU countries both rose by around 3 per cent\u0026nbspduring the quarter. The pound was broadly flat after the rate announcement, which was in line with traders’ expectations.Erik Norland, senior economist at CME Group, said: “Both the pound and UK interest rates are still stuck in a tug of war between a strong employment market and wage growth, which ordinarily would pull them higher, and a soft housing market, weak exports and falling consumer confidence, which are pulling in the opposite direction. \u0026nbsp“Mixed economic indicators, combined with the continuing uncertainty regarding Brexit, are keeping the BoE and markets on hold. That said, if parliament seals the deal to leave the European Union\u0026nbspit will likely send the pound significantly higher and nudge interest rate expectations in the direction of further rate hikes later this year.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If it fails, it could be seen as evidence that he lacks the support he says he has. It might also encourage the authorities, which have already stripped him of parliamentary immunity and opened multiple investigations into him, to arrest him.In January Mr Guaido, the leader of\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s opposition-controlled National Assembly invoked the constitution to declare himself interim president, arguing that Mr\u0026nbspMaduro’s re-election in 2018 was illegitimate.The United States was among some 50 countries that recognise Mr Guaido as\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s president, and\u0026nbspimposed sanctions to try to dislodge Mr Maduro, but the president has so far clung to power.Donald Trump has yet to comment on the uprising, although the White House confirmed he was “monitoring the ongoing situation and secretary of state Mike Pompeo\u0026nbspsaid the US government “fully supports” Mr Guaido’s call for military backing.A former US\u0026nbspofficial said that while it was unclear of Mr Guaido’s efforts would trigger a broader military uprising, it appeared aimed at building momentum towards mass protests planned for Wednesday.Mr\u0026nbspGuaido has said the May Day demonstrations “the largest march in\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s history” and\u0026nbsppart of the “definitive phase” of his effort to take office in order to call fresh elections.Mr Maduro has accused Mr Guaido of being a\u0026nbspUS-backed puppet who seeks to oust him in a coup. The government has arrested Mr Guaido’s top aide, stripped him of his parliamentary immunity and opened multiple probes. It has also barred him from leaving the country, a ban Mr Guaido openly violated earlier this year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was a scammer.The conman first made contact with her via a Facebook fan page dedicated to Derbyshire-born Jason who moved to LA about  years ago.“I thought, ‘Oh, that’s nice of him, talking to his fans’. I might have been star-struck then, I don’t know,” says the anonymous victim. Once she was hooked in, the messages rapidly escalated to “Jason” telling her he loved her and that, surprise surprise, he was having some financial dficulties and needed help because a film payment had been delayed.He added, and I write this verbatim: “I really need you to do this for me honey I can’t trust anyone but you with my money honey.”At this point, did alarm bells ring that she was, in fact, ­conversing with the Hunny ­Monster  Nope, seems not.So, over a period of time, she sent “a substantial amount which would have made a dference to my le and my family”.I’m torn between sympathy and utter disbelief that someone could be so naive.Online fraud is now an epidemic and plenty have lost money in scams so sophisticated that even the most tech-savvy would struggle to spot them.It’s a world away from the ­early-day scams of someone in Nigeria claiming to have a ­fortune locked away in an account they can only accessyou can just send £squillion right now.But what of “Jason Statham” and his like or, worse, the ones who frequent dating sites in the hope of carrying out their sting in person Barely a week goes by when we don’t read a story of someone who thought they had met the partner of their dreams . . . only to discover, several thousand pounds and a whole lot of heartbreak later, that they weren’t who they claimed to be.It goes without saying that loss or loneliness can sometimes make us throw caution to the wind in our search for love.But common sense must always be preserved.FORMER principal ballet dancer Dame Gillian Lynne has left £.million in her will.A robust fortune garnered from her role as choreographer for smash-hit musicals such as Cats and Phantom Of The Opera.Gillian’s path to success is a salutary lesson for anyone currently despairing that their child is struggling at school.When Gillian was young, her mother was concerned about her lack of concentration, and therefore progress, in lessons.So she took her daughter to see a child behavioural specialist who, after a few routine questions, switched on the radio and told Gillian that he and her mother were going to step outside for a while.Once in the corridor, they peeped through the window and watched as Gillian started moving to the music.“There’s nothing wrong with your daughter,” he concluded. “She’s a dancer. Take her to dance school.”Sadly, around  years on, the State still fails to understand that creativity is as important as literacy in giving kids the best chance of a happy, successful adulthood.When you have a spare  minutes, watch Sir Ken Robinson’s TED talk asking: “Do schools kill creativity ”They can, and plenty do. And until the Government changes the education system, thousands of bored, disenfranchised kids will fail in it.WHILE sightseeing in Japan, Ed Sheeran bizarrely chose a full panda outfit in a bid to go incognito.But when he briefly removed it in a store, a fan clocked him and asked for a selfie .Still, nice to see that Ed recovered from the ordeal in time to run the London Marathon.What a showbiz trouper he is.BRITISH-born Michael Adebowale is the evil brute who killed and tried to decapitate soldier Lee Rigby in broad daylight.He is currently residing at Her Majesty’s pleasure in HMP Wakefield – aka “Monster Mansion” – where other lags see him as a top target, and he’s feeling an ickle bit scared, poor lamb.Consequently, he has asked for advice on how to move to a cushier jail in his parents’ home country of Nigeria.The answer, of course, should be a firm no.In the meantime, how refreshing to hear of a ­ruthless killer experiencing jail time that ­actually feels like a ­punishment for his heinous crime.WHEN it launched in , Instagram rapidly became the go-to place for those who wanted to “filter the s**t”out of their everyday lives.Suddenly, no one had any blemishes, they all resembled Elle Macpherson in a bikini and even their cofed and slightly startled dog looked like it had just stepped off the winner’s podium at Crufts.It became known as “Instasham” and, along with other social media sites, took a hefty share of blame for the worrying increase in poor self-esteem among young girls who felt they couldn’t match up to the images of perfection being posted by their idols.Now, riding the waves of a welcome sea change in attitude, media-savvy social media “influencers” are falling over themselves to show how imperfect they are.“Just woken up” selfies with no make-up are a favourite, along with close-ups of spots, stretch marks, cellulite, and tummy rolls . . . all with earnest captions reminding us that we’re not all ­perfect.Undoubtedly, it is a well-meaning step towards helping their young fans realise that whatever face or body you’re born with, it’s better to work at loving who you are and not what you look like.But surely, true progress is when a visible blemish tummy roll stretch mark is deemed so normal that it doesn’t even warrant comment Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its author is not your standard liberal conscience, ­cloistered in Whitehall or a university sociology department.  Baroness Helen Newlove knows only too well what it is like to be a victim of crime.Twelve years ago she was an ordinary mum living in a suburb of Warrington, Cheshire, when her husband left their home to confront a group of drunken youths who were vandalising his car. He never ed.He was kicked and beaten so savagely that he later died in hospital.What was especially galling for his we and three daughters was that the three youths responsible —  who were each jailed for le — had been the ­subject of numerous complaints.One of those jailed for Garry’s murder had already been on an assault charge but had been released on bail just a few hours earlier to resume his le ­terrorising local residents.Neither police, prosecutors nor the courts seemed to appreciate just how far out of control the youths had become.They failed to put together numerous complaints of antisocial behaviour to see the overall picture. As a result, the problem was allowed to escalate to its murderous conclusion.Sadly, to judge by Baroness Newlove’s report, too little has changed in the years since her first husband’s ­murder. Still, she says, police are treating complaints about anti- social behaviour as isolated incidents, each dismissed as “low-level crime”.A vandalised car is treated as a problem to be sorted out with an insurance claim.  Youths riding motorbikes round a children’s playground might be challenged by police on one ­occasion but it is never followed up.  Dope-smoking seems effectively to have been legalised, the police ­having all but given up even speaking to those involved. At the same time, incidents of antisocial behaviour are  rising sharply.Last year,  per cent of people responding to the British Crime Survey — an annual poll of more than , randomly-selected Britons — reported witnessing antisocial behaviour, up from . per cent the year before.This wasn’t how it was supposed to be.In  the Government introduced what it called a “community trigger” — which was supposed to give residents the right to demand greater actionthree or more separate reports on antisocial behaviour were received within a six-month period.Residents can demand a “case review”, at which the authorities must explain what action they intend to take.Yet in half of local authority areas, says Newlove, the community trigger process was not used during  .Newlove also has a gripe with the police  service — the non-emergency number introduced in .  It was ­supposed to encourage us to report non-le-threatening incidents for which we might be reluctant to call .But, as I found from my own experience, it seems to be used as a means of fobbing us off.When I came across someone stealing from a pile of wood by the roadside I rang the number —  but it took ages to have the call answered and even when it was, nothing  happened, even though I had taken down the registration plate of the thieves’  vehicle.To cap the insult, while  calls are free it costs p to call .Of course, police can’t be expected to deal with and solve every single crime. I know that officer numbers have fallen and that in some areas they are struggling with an epidemic of kne murders, which obviously needs to take priority.Butyou give people the impression that you are no longer even bothering to try to police “low-level” crime, you are just inviting the problem to escalate.It isn’t just the police, however, who are responsible for the lack of action on antisocial behaviour. Local authorities have filled their town centres with enforcement officers, who merrily hand out £ fines for the smallest misdemeanours, such as dropping fag ends.Yet the private firms trusted with ­dealing with litter louts — and who are disgracefully often employed on contracts which incentivise them to hand out as many fines as  possible — are not  interested in policing housing estates.They are only interested in what they find profitable — dishing out fines to soft targets in shopping centres.Serious antisocial behaviour of the sort which preceded Garry Newlove’s murder falls between two stools — it is considered too much bother for enforcement officers but not serious enough for police investigation.But as Baroness Newlove knows only too well, turning a blind eye to repeated antisocial behaviour makes the lives of residents a misery and can end up ­having fatal consequences.The Government has been quick to respond to proposals from the usual bleeding-heart liberals who seem to run the criminal justice system — recently agreeing, for example, to look into ­abolishing prison sentences of less than six months.Ministers must take note of what the outgoing Victims’ Commissioner is saying on the lax approach to antisocial ­behaviour and put the interests of the victims, not criminals, first. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All have blocked the biggest vote in UK democracy. Brexit must be defended.Sources at counts across the country told The Sun that they were seeing a huge spike in the number of spoilt ballots from angry voters.The picture for Labour wasnt positive either as they failed to make the gains they wanted in key areas - and lost councils Wirral and Hartlepool.as-graphic-election-vTory MP Vicky Ford said she was gutted to see Chelmsford council go to the Liberal Democrats overnight.Its been brutal, she said.Tory deputy Chairman James Cleverly told Sky News that a terrible night could see them lose up to , seats.There will be frustration, and because we are the party of Government, that will be disproportionately taken out on us, he said.But they arent on track for anywhere near those losses at the moment, which will give Mrs May a small bit of relief this morning.And  backbench chairman Sir Graham Brady added: There is frustration that we have yet to see [Brexit] through and get a resolution.Some Conservative voters chose to stay at home, and looking at the spoiled ballot papers, there are more than is usually the case.But grassroots Tories across the country vented their fury and disappointment with their party after a dficult night for them.Tony Berry, the leader of the Tories on Cotswold District Council, who have lost the council to Liberal Democrats after  years in charge, blasted: I would ask [Theresa May] to consider her position very carefully.He blamed Brexit and professional politicians who are basically working for themselves rather than necessarily what is best for the country.Tory leader in Bath and North East Somerset, Tim Warren, who lost his seat to a Liberal Democrat, said people wanted to punish us for a lack of action in Government.There needs to be a change in action, he stressed.A clearly frustrated Donna Jones, the Conservative group leader on Portsmouth City Council said: I think [Mrs May] needs to take a look at how many councillors we’ve lost overnight, wake up in the morning and think about how she thinks the Conservative party needs to put its best foot forward.And Tory Brexiteer Bernard Jenkin told the BBC: People are very disillusioned, that the country made a decision and the politicians havent implemented.[Theresa May] still has a degree of personal sympathy but people think it’s time for a change.They can see she’s lost the plot, she’s not in control of events.Ex-Cabinet minister Priti Patel said the pitul message she was getting on the doorstep from voters showed her it was time for the PM to go.People have very categorically said she is part of the problem, she said.Our party leadership needs to make some very, very serious decisions.

Published with -year-old promotion brochures, they show it at ious stages of building and illustrate its history into the modern era. Standout images include art deco drawings from , elaborate gold and silver foil designs from the s and a sobering grey outline of the tower from during the Blitz in . Other pictures date back to  when thousands lined the promenade to view the foundation stone being laid. The ft in tower was the brainchild of former Blackpool mayor Sir John Bickerstaffe who visited the  World Fair in Paris and was inspired by Gustave Efel’s ,ft edice. At first it was far from a soaring success. The Blackpool Tower Company offered £, worth of shares to the public but only two-thirds were taken up, forcing the directors to ask for more cash from existing shareholders.    The company’s poor financial situation was worsened by its falling share price, forcing Bickerstaffe to buy up all the available shares. But eventually funding was secured and building began, using five million bricks, , tons of steel and  tons of cast iron. The total cost for design and construction was about £, – £million at today’s prices. On May  staff in replica Victorian unorms will welcome guests and letime admission will be given to babies born at the town’s Victoria Hospital on the day. During the celebrations, the organisers hope to enable every local child up to the age of  to visit the top of the world’s th-tallest freestanding where views stretch as far as the Isle of Man,  miles across the Irish Sea.    General manager Kenny Mew said: “It is an incredible honour to run the tower in such a landmark year. It resonates in the hearts and minds of all of its guests since it opened all those years ago. “From spotting it as you ap­­­proach the resort to seeing it sparkling during the illuminations, it is a staple of the town’s history and celebrates the very best of British.” Unlike the Efel Tower, Blackpool Tower is not freestanding.Its base is hidden by a three-storey red-brick block housing a iety of attractions, including the iconic Tower Ballroom. The lavish Victorian edice, which features every year as a venue on BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing , will hold a VIP event with performances from musicians including Phil Kelsall, resident organist at the ballroom for more than  years.   In March the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge enjoyed a slightly rainy day out in Blackpool. They started with a visit to the tower, joined a briefing about regeneration efforts in the town and took part in a walkabout. The visit came  years after Wills’ mother, Princess Diana, opened the refurbished tower complex in . Artists who have performed there over the years include Arthur Askey, Duke Ellington, celebrated Polish concert pianist Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Dame Clara Butt and Cleo Laine.    In , during the Second World War, the crow’s nest at the top of the tower was removed to allow the it to be used as a Royal Air Force radar station. The steelwork is usually painted dark red but in  – the landmark’s centenary year – it was redecorated in gold by abseiling painters known as “stick men”. And in  the top was painted silver as part of Queen’s Silver Jubilee celebrations.

Asked whether there needed to be changes in leadership or policies at the top of the Conservative Party, Mr Warren replied: There needs to be a change in action. MP Wera Hobhouse commended fellow Liberal Democrat Dave Wood on his victory in Bath, noting that the result means he is now the local councillor for Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg. Congratulations to Cllr Dave Wood, who moments ago beat BNES council leader Tim Warren, she tweeted. Heaposs now Jacob-Rees-Moggaposs local councillor! The start of a very good night in Bath!

The Tories lost hundreds of seats as local councillors were punished for a Parliament in chaos over Brexit. But Labour failed to seize the spoils from the Toriesapos loss - with huge gains instead going to the Lib Dems, who boasted of their best night for  years. By am, with  out of  councils declared, the Tories had lost  seats overall. And despite fighting a beleaguered party of government that did well last time, Labour also lost .The Lib Dems had gained  seats while the Greens gained  and Independents gained .     More than , seats were up for election across England outside London. Local factors will always be partly to blame, and thereaposs a mixed picture. Labour did well in some areas like Trafford while losing control of symbolic northern Hartlepool, Bolsover and Wirral. Thereaposs also much more to come, with half of councils only declaring during Friday afternoon. But some MPs were quick to blame the partyaposs middle-ground approach to Brexit.Labour MP Jess Phillips fumed: I canapost help but think that the public like a clear message eventhey donapost always agree with it. . Tories are losing hundreds of seats - and thataposs VERY bad news for them in the EU elections  Itaposs been a bruising night for the Conservative Party as they lost more than  seats. The Tories lost control of heartland working-class Home Counties councils including Basildon, Southend-on-Sea and Folkestone  Hythe. Commuter-belt St Albans and Welwyn Hatfield also fell out of blue control. They also lost control of Broxtowe - home to the Remainer MP Anna Soubry - amid Labour gains. None of that bodes well for the EU elections on May , where the Tories will be up against Nigel Farageaposs Brexit Party . . It may not be bad enough to force out Theresa May  The damage limitation spin machine is in its full  RPM cycle as Tories point out the losses werenapost as bad as expected. And so far thataposs true, as there were predictions the Tories would lose  to , seats.Tory MPs looking for a glimmer of hope are right about another thing too - the Conservatives made good gains the last time these seats were up for election in .And as todayaposs elections were mainly in Tory strongholds , the Tories had the most to lose. Tory Brexiteer Priti Patel said people had made clear Theresa May was part of the problem and there needs to be a change of leadership. And yes, there is a grassroots movement against her. But others will move to paint the result as not a disaster and keep the PM in office. Brexit Minister James Cleverly said: If it was  [losses] rather than , I would be happy with that. And in reality, with the EU elections in three weeks looking like they could go much worse for the Tories, MPs may wait until then to move against Mrs May. Conservative MP for East Surrey Sam Gyimah said the partyaposs loss of control in Tandridge, Surrey, was disappointing but not surprising, citing two non-Brexit-related issues. And while the Conservative party suffered signicant losses across the country, Tory MP Eddie Hughes had cause to celebrate as his party gained Walsall North from no overall control. . Labour are NOT profiting from the Tory failure Labour have been in opposition for nine years but are not making the kind of gains you might expect. Jeremy Corbynaposs party had some big symbolic wins, finally seizing the once-blue Manchester island of Trafford back into red control. There were some southern gains too, such as six seats in Folkestone and Hythe. And Labour gained one seat in Peterborough - which is staging a crucial by-election on June  - as the Tories lost it to No Overall Control. But Labour also lost control of northern Bolsover, home to legendary Brexiteer Labour MP Dennis Skinner. The party failed to gain control of Midlands Brexit stomping ground Stoke-on-Trent. Hartlepool was lost from Labour control as was Wirral - where the Labour share of the vote was down %, according to the BBC. And an eye-watering nine seats were lost in northern Labour heartland - and Leave-voting area - Sunderland. Labour’s Dawn Butler has admitted Labour did not do as well as expected because MPs are “in a mess”. The shadow cabinet minister told Sky News: “We have to be honest, parliament is a mess at the moment, we’re not making much progress, so it does affect everybody in parliament.” She added: “These are very unusual times politically. Some have described it as being since World War  we haven’t seen this type of election Polling guru John Curtice said the Tories were being punished more heavily in the south of England, where Lib Dems often have a hold, than the Labour north. Clearly these elections were never going to be easy for us and there are still many results to come, said Labour MP Nia Grfith at am. . Yet Lib Dems have their aposbest results since apos - even in Brexit Country Lib Dems could not contain there glee after picking up a string of seats and gaining control of key areas - including Brexiteer Tory Jacob Rees-Moggaposs back yard. They also gained Winchester, North Norfolk and Cotswold. With predictions the Lib Dems could gain as many as  seats, MP Layla Moran claimed these are the best local election results for the party since  - in the aftermath of the Iraq War. MP Ed Davey claimed his party was having an awesome night thanks to voters rejecting Labour and the Conservatives, citing hard work rather than Brexit issues for their success. . The Green Party and Independents have done well too The Green Party and Independents had an excellent night as voters vent their protest against the main two parties, polling guru John Curtice said. The expert said it was one of the Greensapos best performances ever. It comes in the wake of the Extinction Rebellion protests, which have raised awareness of climate issues. But the rise of Independents and small parties also recognises an anger at the main, establishment parties. Independents gained  seats in Bolsover and gained North Kesteven council from the Tories. . The North South ide is real The same picture keeps being highlighted - Labour gains are best in the South, and Tory losses are worst in the South. Politics professor at Manchester University Rob Ford claimed the north saw a swing of % against the Tories and % against Labour. Yet in the Midlands there was no change for Labour, as opposed to a % drop for the Midlands. And in the South, Labour gained .%, as opposed to a .% Tory drop - with a whopping . point swing from the Conservatives to Jeremy Corbynaposs Party. . But furious Labour MPs are blaming Brexit for the struggle Remain-backing Labour MPs claim the party is struggling because it hasnapost come down firmly on one side over Brexit. The party is continuing to pursue its own Brexit plan, while keeping a second EU referendum as an option on the table in case needed, but not in all cases. Labour MP Jess Phillips reacted by saying her partyaposs position on Brexit had failed. Iaposm off to bed as have to be up at am to do the school run, she tweeted. My final word is that I think our position on Brexit has failed. Bravery is needed. If you combine kindness and effectiveness with a bit of grit most people will respect you even when they donapost always agree. Fellow Labour MP Wes Streeting said losses in Sunderland and Liverpool demonstrated that looking both ways on Brexit isnapost doing Labour any good.

Amid voter anger at the continuing wrangling over Brexit, the Brexit Minister James Cleverly suggested he would be relievedthe losses could be held to  council seats. Nine years into government you would expect us to be losing lots and lots of seats, he told the BBC. It would be unrealistic for me to pretend after nine years in government and Brexit as a backdrop that this is going to be anything other than a really, really tough night for us. If it was  , rather than ,, I would be happy with that.  With some analysts predicting losses of  or more for the Tories, the results are likely to pile pressure on Theresa May at a time she is embroiled in a row over the sacking of ex-defence secretary Gavin Williamson. The senior Tory Brexiteer MP Sir Bernard Jenkin said voters overwhelmingly believed that she had lost the plot and that the time had come for a change of leader. She still has a degree of personal sympathy but I think people think it is time for a change. They can see that she has lost the plot. They can see she is not in control of events, he told the BBC. Certainly among Conservative activists and council candidates there is an almost universal feeling that it is time for her to move on. In early results, the Conservatives lost control of Basildon and Southend in Essex but hung on in the bellwether council of Swindon.  With Labour also struggling with isions over over Brexit, senior figures were playing down the prospect of making signicant gains at the expense of the Conservatives. Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner suggested they would be satisfiedthey could take back the  seats they lost the last time these seats were fought in . These elections will be a test of the Conservative Party far more than a test of the Labour Party or any of the other parties, he told the BBC. I would like us to come back to where we should have been the last time round. However the party suffered an early setback with the loss of control of Hartlepool. In contrast, the Liberal Democrats, who lost heavily in , were buoyant, with deputy leader Jo Swinson predicting three-figure gains. Out and about across the country, the mood has been positive. If we can get into the triple figures of gains that would be a really, really good night, she said. That would be part of that Lib Dem fightback that is happening.

The pensioner attacked the “stupid” system after taking a taxi to her local polling station in Pendle, Lancashire, only to be told she couldn’t vote. She told the Mirror she brought a photograph of herself, rather than a photo ID, after she misunderstood the instructions. Pendle Borough Council ing officer Philip Mousdale told the Mirror he was very sorry to hear about the case and the last thing we want is people being unable to vote. It came as voters across  areas elected , councillors in todayaposs town hall elections - with polls closing at pm. Most voters can cast their ballot simply by giving their name. But  council areas - including Pendle - are piloting a controversial anti-fraud scheme that demands ID from voters before they can cast their ballot. The scheme is being rolled out by the Tory government at a cost of millions of pounds despite just eight allegations of in-person voter fraud last year. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn responded to our story by saying: The Conservatives are trying to rig our elections by making it harder for people to vote - itaposs voter suppression. These dangerous voter ID plans must be scrapped.    The Mirror knows the womanaposs identity but she asked to stay anonymous. She said: “I am nearly . And the officers that were on, they know me, but they weren’t allowed to let me vote. How stupid is that ” The pensioner claimed she had voted in every election since she came of age at  - even small local elections. But speaking just after lunchtime, she said she was not planning toto vote before polls closed today at pm. She said: “I can’t fly so I’ve no passport now. I can’t drive so I’ve no driving licence now.  “If I’d been in Craven they would have accepted my bankers’ card but because I’m in Pendle they don’t accept it.” The Cabinet Office and Pendle Council insisted a wide range of photo ID - not just driversapos licences or passports - could be used. The woman said she later went to a luncheon club with her husband, where another diner said they had torn up their ballot paper in protest. The woman - who declined to tell us how she would have voted - said: “I just think it’s not right. “We’ve lived all our lives in England and are having to take a photograph to confirm who we are.” It is thought the womanaposs husband did bring photo ID.    Pendle was one of two councils in todayaposs pilot where polling stations would only accept photo ID. The other was Woking. Either a photo ID or a polling card were acceptable in Mid Sussex, Watford and North West Leicestershire. And polling stations were able to accept either one piece of photo ID, or two pieces of non-photo ID, in Broxtowe, Craven, Derby, North Kesteven and Braintree. The -year-old womanaposs case was flagged to a local Labour Party office. Labour candidate Wayne Blackburn, , said it was by far the worst case he had seen. He told us at pm, when polls had been open for eight hours: I have heard of a couple more where people have been turned away. In one case someone was turned away and they categorically said they wouldnapost be ing.  A Pendle Borough Council official confirmed the womanaposs account of what happened was accurate. Pendle Borough Council ing officer Philip Mousdale told the Mirror: “The last thing we want is people being unable to vote so I’m very sorry to hear about this case. “We ran a far reaching communications campaign, which included writing to all households twice, to let residents know that photo ID would be needed to vote and how to apply for a Local Electoral Cardthey didn’t have any. “And the poll cards were another reminder of the need for photo ID listing what would be accepted.” Other anecdotal cases have been reported to the Mirror. And one voter, Jake Pitt, wrote on Twitter : Went to vote in Mid Sussex today which is trialing VoterID - had a polling card but was told I was not on the system,  mins later after presiding officer calls the database controller Iaposm finally able to vote. Chaotic. Have you been turned away today in one of the  trial areas for having no ID  Did youand vote later  Get in touch with us using this form or email webnews@mirror. Labouraposs Shadow Minister for Voter Engagement Cat Smith said: “It is unsurprising that reports are coming in of legitimate and honest voters being denied their right to vote because of these undemocratic and unpopular pilot schemes. “Time and time again Labour warned that Voter ID will make it harder for people to vote but this Government ploughed ahead with this dangerous policy. “Given that there is no evidence of widespread electoral fraud, one voter being turned away from the polling station is too many. “After today’s shambles, it’s clear that Voter ID has no place in our democracy and should be abandoned immediately.    Groups including Age UK, Liberty and the British Youth Council united in a joint warning over the voter ID checks as the polls opened today. Caroline Abrahams, Charity Director of Age UK, claimed ID checks “could inadvertently impede some older people from voting” as they are less likely to have photo ID. She added: “We understand that it is important to reduce the risks of electoral fraud but this could end up undermining the democracy they are designed to protect.” Darren Hughes, Chief Executive of the Electoral Reform Society , said: “These voter ID plans –rolled out nationally -  could pull up the drawbridge for millions of voters.” There were eight cases of alleged apospersonationaposlast year, down from  in ,  in ,  in  and  in .  Yet an ERS study last year claimed  people were turned away in the five previous trial areas for not having ID. Ministers spent £.m on the trial of ID checks in five areas last year, with voter ID checks expected to cost between £.m and £.mrolled out in a full general election, depending on the system used. Despite a challenge by campaigners, the High Court has ruled ID checks lawful. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: Electoral fraud is an unacceptable crime that strikes at a core principle of our democracy - that everyone’s vote matters. Showing ID to vote is a reasonable way to stop this and is something people already do every day, when they pick up a parcel at the Post Office, claim their benefits, or take out a library book. Both last year’s pilots and the decades of experience of Northern Ireland show that voter ID does not have an adverse effect on election turnout or participation.

Putting himself forward, the former prisons minister called for the next Tory leader to come from the radical centre. Mr Stewart said: I think itaposs important at this time when the Prime Ministeraposs said sheaposs going to step down to have a voice thataposs arguing for being radical. But, radical in the centre of British politics, not radical on the extreme right of British politics. A voice thataposs prepared to say I do want to bring this country together.That, of course, I accept Brexit , Iaposm a Brexiteer, but I want to reach out to Remain voters as well to bring this country together again. The Cabinet minister told BBC Radio  podcast Political Thinking with Nick Robinson that he wanted to set out his vision. He said: The only way I can do that is by moving beyond my brief and beginning to lay out, whether itaposs on climate change or any of these other issues, what I think it would mean to be a country we can be proud of. I have to get the balance right because my primary job is to look after my department and thataposs what I really want to focus on day in, day out, but ultimately the Prime Minister is going to step down andweaposre going to have a leadership contest we might as well be open about it and candidates might as well explain what theyaposre about. Mr Stewart was promoted to Cabinet rank in the reshuffle triggered by the sacking of former defence secretary Gavin Williamson. The International Development Secretary said: I do think we need to invest more in public services. I think austerity has ended and we need to move into a new world of public investment, but as that happens we really need to up our game. The basic test is pride and dignity.    Referring to Mr Williamson, who was sacked following an inquiry into a National Security Council leak, the International Development Secretary said: Gavin was an extremely energetic secretary of state for defence and whatever happened in those last days and whatever he did wrong at the end, we owe him huge respect for what he did before that.

The street in Kingaposs Norton, Birmingham, appears rundown and aposdecayedapos.Empty buildings have been set on fire, stripped of lead and plastered in graffiti while the street is regularly fly-tipped with rubbish, paint and large tyres, Birmingham Live reports.A former resident said: Itaposs almost like a cowboy Western film with an ambush site in the canyon. People know not to go down there, itaposs dangerous. The street has become a magnet for anti-social behaviour and people have called it dangerous after a taxi driver was stabbed there. Most of the residents on the Avenue have been moved out as many of the buildings are to be torn down as part of a wider regeneration project by Birmingham City Council. The project has been rehousing tenants in the last two years.  But the authority has been criticised for leaving some residents, whose bungalows are to remain, isolated and vulnerable due to slow progress with the scheme. The council confirmed demolition was due to start next month, saying delays had been caused by having to acquire private properties and carrying out bat surveys.West Midlands Police  has declared the road, and others surrounding it, as a priority.Public safety concerns have heightened after an incident on Sunday, March , when a taxi driver was stabbed by two passengers who demanded money from him and then stole his car.  The -year-old man was taken to hospital with none le-threatening injuries after Kathleen Witheridge, , who lives in a bungalow on Gildas Avenue, flagged down police. She said: I had a knock on the door. I donapost open the door in the evenings but I looked through the spy hole and could see blood on the manaposs face. I opened it on the chain and he said aposcan you call the police Iaposve been stabbedapos. I opened the door and saw it wasnapost just his face, he was covered in blood, he had multiple stab wounds. It frightened the le out of me to be truthful. I couldnapost get the vision of the man out of my head. It was a few nights before I could sleep. It really upset me.  Describing everyday le on Gildas Avenue she added: Mostly itaposs just kids being idiots, knocking doors and running off. I try to keep myself to myself and donapost go out in the evenings. But it looks really horrible. Itaposs like a war zone with all of the rubbish and graffiti everywhere. I donapost feel comfortable here at the moment. Theyshould put boards or railings up around the buildings just to make us feel like something is moving forward. Nobody tells us anything.  Neighbours echoed the feeling. Mother-of-two Michelle Mulhall, aged , said: I think itaposs disgusting how the council have left residents. Itaposs bad down here. The buildings have just been boarded up and left. Nobody wants to come down here. Jane Cope, chairperson for the neighbouring Druids Heath and Monyhull Forum, is a former resident of the area and is worried for the safety of those who remain, including her friend Kathleen.  She said: The taxi driver was lured there to be attacked. Since then itaposs become a no-go zone. People know they are vulnerablethey go down there. You have also got these little alleyways leading off it where people can make a quick getaway. Itaposs almost like a cowboy Western film with an ambush site in the canyon. People know not to go down there, itaposs dangerous. Thereaposs just a complete lack of security. Thereaposs vulnerable people in those bungalows who are scared to open their doors. They have been left there with no support.  The forum is also concerned with the way the city council handles major estate regeneration, with their ward Druids Heath earmarked for similar redevelopment over the coming years. Ms Cope added: The residents have been in touch with the council to say whataposs happening and nobody is giving them answers. I appreciatethere are issues but keeping people in the dark doesnapost help, because it gives them no hope. If itaposs going to be some time before the buildings are taken down then they shouldnapost leave those people so scared and vulnerable. It could mean relocating them or upping security measures.  A council spokeswoman said: Gildas Avenue is part of the first phase of a broader six-year clearance programme which will help to regenerate the area. All council tenants have been rehoused however, there were a number of private properties which have been acquired from owners on a voluntary basis. Planning approval was granted [for demolition] subject to a number of conditions, one of which was that bat surveys had to be carried out to all properties. These can only be carried out once properties were vacant and are set to commence imminently and will take two weeks. Following this activity, demolition is intended for early June .  She added: This is a six-year regeneration programme and so as new information becomes available and our wider plans for the estate are developed, residents will be kept informed as to progress and time scales and given the opportunity for input and comment. Gildas Avenue is also on a weekly rota for collection, removal and safe disposal of any fly-tipping. The area is also part of the management regime meaning officers carry out an estate check to ensure the void premises are secure and where there is a breach, appropriate action is taken. The team works closely with the emergency services to identy and mitigate any risk. A force spokeswoman said: Officers are aware of anti-social behaviour, arson and criminal damage issues in the residential areas surrounding Arrow Walk Park, Kings Norton. The area is currently being treated as a priority and West Midlands Police is focusing resources and activities to prevent crime and potentially reduce overall crime levels in the wider locality. The area encompasses The Fold, Gildas Avenue, Sisefield Road and Greaves Square. She confirmed the stabbing incident was still being investigated adding: No arrests have been made but the taxi cab was recovered shortly after the incident and has been forensically examined. Investigators are also following up a number of other leads.Anyone with information on the incident should contact police on  or via live chat at  west-midlands.police.uk  quoting the crime reference BW L ."},{"url":null,"title":"bank holiday weather polar plunge","story":"NewsBank Holiday weather: Polar plunge for Britain with bone-rattling -C temperaturesWidespread frost is expected overnight for much of the UK this weekend which could be coldest May Bank Holiday everShareCommentsByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,thumbnailUrl:https:cf-images.eu-west-.prod.boltdns.net v static  bcb-e-c--cce baadf--e-a-fcfb x match image.jpg,description:Thursday evening  forecast ,leadVideoAutoplay:true,hideEmbed:,bumperDisabled:,createdDateAsDate:--T::Z,publishedDateAsDate:--T::Z,lastModiedDateAsDate:--T::Z,videoHeadline:Thursday evening forecast ,keywords:,duration:,uploadDate:--T::Z,seo:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video thursday-evening-forecast-nd--,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:,placement:lead,duration:,id:,uploader:Jasper Pickering,source:befcfffcdfbffbc,contentVertical:Undefined,site:Undefined,clearance:Network,sourceUrl:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe May Bank Holiday weekend could be the coldest on record with temperatures plunging to an icy -C.

Her mum Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, took the snaps at Kensington Palace and the family’s Norfolk home of Anmer Hall last month. The princess, who is fourth in line to the throne, is pictured in a summer dress as she sits crossed legged on a patch of grass at the palace. Little Charlotte is wearing brother Prince George’s shoes he wore last June to the Maserati Royal Charity Polo Trophy at Beaufort Park in Gloucester when they were both pictured running carefree across the fields.    In the other two images, taken at the Cambridge’s home of Anmer Hall, the Queen’s great-granddaughter is pictured running and smiling as she holds a flower while in the other photograph she sits on a fence beaming at the camera. The Duchess is a keen and accomplished amateur photographer who has letime honorary membership of the Royal Photographic Society which recognised her “talent and enthusiasm”.  Meanwhile, Kate opened a mental health charity’s £ million centre on Wednesday which officials hope will be a “game changer” in supporting young people. She said she was “proud” to see the new home of the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families, which she supports as patron. The facility brings a range of experts under one roof in King’s Cross, London.  At the event, Kate revealed how daughter Charlotte loves playing with “pink slime”. She joined a small group of children attending their first lesson in the new Pears Family School classrooms and shared a laugh with Narriyah, seven, and her grandmother Rose - about the playful gunk. Rose, who declined to give her last name, said: “Kate was talking about her daughter and said when Charlotte plays with slime it’s pink but by the time she’s finished it is brown. “Narriyah is just the same, she’s obsessed with slime.” "},{"url":null,"title":"royal baby meghan markle live","story":"NewsRoyal baby watch LIVE: Latest news as Meghan Markle due to give birth any day nowMeghan Markle and Prince Harry will soon welcome their baby into the world - but as ever its a royal baby birth with a dferenceShareByBradley JollyDanya BazaraaNews ReporterZoe ForseyUpdated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video duchess-sussex-pregnancy-timeline-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,articleTypeName:brightcoveVideo,url:https:www.mirror news uk-news video thursday-evening-forecast-nd--,articleUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news bank-holiday-weather-polar-plunge-,thumbnailUrl:https:cf-images.eu-west-.prod.boltdns.net v static  bcb-e-c--cce baadf--e-a-fcfb x match image.jpg,duration:,videoId:,isVideoRelation:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

However, Mr Cameron had failed to noty Scottish Borders Council planners about the change of use, who found out once concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received an enforcement notice from the council outlining its grievances, which included concerns over noise disturbances, a detrimental impact on residential amenity and a breach of planning protocol.Mr Cameron subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.Despite this, the DPEA has ruled against the West Linton businessman, and has been two months to cease using the property as a party mansion.Chirs Norman, a DPEA reporter appointed by Scottish Ministers, writes in his ruling: ldquoBefore  November  the availability of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo for holiday letting, and its limited use for  weeks, was ordinarily incidental to its main use as a house.ldquoSome two or three years after  November  it ceased to be the appellantrsquos main residence.ldquoFrom  lsquoGreenloaningrsquo was continually promoted and used as self-catering accommodation for short-stay lets.ldquoOn the balance of probability and on the basis of the evidence before me I find that the unauthorised change of use of the house occurred between  November  and  November .ldquoTherefore the council is not time-barred from taking enforcement action and the appellantrsquos appeal fails.ldquoI find that the house is accessed from an unsurfaced road in the north-east part of West Linton and is in an area characterised by large, in the main, detached houses set in substantial garden grounds in a semi-rural part of the village.ldquoIts location some  metres from the A  and the centre of the village means that residents in the area enjoy a very high standard of amenity.ldquoI have studied the representations on the case and note the alleged impact on residential amenity caused by the use of the property for short-stay letting.ldquoI further note that the appellant has taken steps to curtail the effects of the unauthorised use, and in particular noise and alleged anti-social behaviour.ldquoI am also mindful of the support given by persons staying at lsquoGreenloaningrsquo to businesses in the village.ldquoHowever, I conclude that the unauthorised use of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo has an unacceptable impact on the character of the established amenity in this generally quiet part of West Linton.ldquoExternal activity can arise after . hours and a signicant change into the quiet residential area has been introduced.ldquoThe two-month time period for the cessation of the use is reasonable, given the impact of the unauthorised development on the amenity of this part of West Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"explorers-great-mystery-comes-to-borders-stages","story":"A LIGHT-HEARTED romp featuring starvation, scurvy, cannibalism and some jolly tunes comes to the Borders next week.The new play by Peter Arnott for Mull Theatre, Unspotted Snow, is based on the tale of Sir John Franklinrsquos ill-fated expedition to discover the Northwest Passage.In , Franklin and  men sailed off to discover a route from the Atlantic to the Pacic via the north coast of Canada, but were never seen again.A bold and adventurous account of tragedy, mishap, folly, arrogance and madness, it also serves as a cautionary tale of true-blue British heroism ndash and some ruthless news management.After nine years, news of the expedition was at last brought to London by the remarkable Orcadian explorer and physician John Rae, who worked for the Hudsonrsquos Bay Company.The news he brought was both tragic and grizzly. Unfortunately for Rae, it was the wrong story ndash true, but wrong in that it was not the story that Victorian England wanted.Unspotted Snow is a play of two halves: the first set on the barren ice flows of the Arctic and the second in the equally inhospitable environment of Lady Jane Franklinrsquos drawing room.As playwright Arnott explained, unlike Franklin and the majority of th century British explorers, Rae was uninterested in conquest and the imposition of religious, commercial, or imperial norms on the wilderness.ldquoLike John Muir in Calornia, he anticipated a much more lsquomodernrsquo holistic approach to the natural world, not seeing people as being conquerors of empty space but as inhabitants of a planet shared with other forms of le, he said.The story of the expedition has fascinated the general public, scientists and explorers for over  years.From early findings of frozen corpses and a few artefacts to the very recent discoveries of the expeditionrsquos boats, the Erebusand the Terror , successive generations have been enthralled by the ambition and daring-do of the explorers and by their terrying, macabre fate.That fascination, and the split between two realities, is emphasised by the two-part nature of the play.ldquoIn the first half, a kind of horror-comedy, we have an encounter between three of the last survivors of Franklinrsquos expedition and some Inuit ladies to whom they utterly fail to explain themselves, explained Arnott.ldquoAnd then, in a curious echo of that, we have the inhospitable wilderness of Lady Franklinrsquos Drawing Room, where John Rae again finds himself telling a story that his audience simply cannot, or will not, understand.Unspotted Snow will be performed at the MacArts in Galashiels on Thursday, May  and

election riots, contracted Malaria and suffered a iety of broken bones having fallen down a storm drain.Dominic, who is , told the Border : ldquoWe really donrsquot have any idea of how others live on the other side of the world in some of the poorest countries on earth.ldquoI spent most of my time living in slums, which ied from corrugated houses to mud houses with grass thatched roofs.During his time in Africa, Dominic acted as a trustee for Roll Out the Barrel Trust UK, a project that aims to help with water supply issues in some of the worldrsquos poorest countries.Dominic also helped found a charity in Kenya, The Sunflower Community Orphans Support Project.The organization helps feed orphaned children, many of whom are affected by poverty and HIV AIDS, by using the proceeds of a cafeacute selling food to the public.Dominic fully embraced the lestyle of the local community, enduring the same daily struggles faced by the local population.ldquoI experienced what it was like to have electricity and water shortages and to fetch and carry drinking water.ldquoFor the two years I went without washing machines, showers, fridges, cookers, TV or a flushing toilet.His desire to experience the tough reality of le in these societies is perhaps unsurprising given his previous holiday destinations have included North Korea, Chernobyl and the annexed Crimean Peninsula.Despite the dficulties faced by the communities he assisted, Dominic was struck by the gratitude and positivity he encountered. He said: ldquoThe best part was seeing the smiles and laughs of the people I helped.ldquoThey were grateful and happy, and because I lived like the majority of the people in the slum they made feel a part of the community - I really did feel like it was home.This sense of community was demonstrated when a newly born child was named after him, an experience which left Dominic ldquospeechless and overwhelmed.The experiences of his spartan existence during his charitable travels, and the positivity of communities with so few of the things we take for granted, have shaped Dominicrsquos attitude

Valley.Warrington-based WHP Telecoms plans on erecting a  metre-high G tower on Deephope Hill, just off the B between Eskdalemuir and Ettrick.The plans have largely been welcomed by local residents, who cite the current lack of mobile phone signal as a detriment to both the quality of le in the valley and the ability of businesses to thrive.However, they also attracted nine letters of objection, which cited concerns over the height of the mast, the impact on the landscape and the potential detrimental impact on property prices.One supporter, Ogilvie Jackson, of Selkirk, appeared before Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday to urge councillors to support the plans.He told the committee: ldquoWe have been lobbying very hard to get mobile coverage in the valley.ldquoFor the last three years our neighbours at Ettrick village have enjoyed good coverage due to government funded masts that tower over the settlement.ldquoThe mast before you will give us near perfect G coverage for the Ettrick Valley.ldquoThe proposed site could not be better. In fact compared to some masts in the Borders itrsquos very discreet.ldquoMany motorists have been stranded and unable to secure help because of the lack of phone signal. This mast will make our valley a safer and more self-reliant place to live.ldquoI would say this to the objectors: itrsquos easy to object to a phone mast just because you donrsquot like phone masts. If that happened everywhere there would be no mobile coverage in the country.Councillors sitting on the planning and building standards committee were advised by planning officers that the benefits outweigh the impact of the mastBarry Fotheringham, the councilrsquos principal planning officer, told the committee: ldquoThe proposed mast and associated equipment form part of a national programme to deliver a new mast network and telecommunications coverage in hard to reach areas in Scotland that do not benefit from mobile telephone connectivity.ldquoThe proposed mast will be visible in the landscape but it is considered that the benefits of having a strong telecommunications signal in the Ettrick Valley outweigh the limited and localised landscape and visual impacts.ldquoThe proposed mast will be future-proofed so that it can accommodate other users and G networks. This will avoid the need for a proleration of other masts locally.ldquoThe proposed development complies with the principal policy requirements of the local development plan and is consistent with ensuring that an improved digital infrastructure is available, to ensure people and communities are better connected.While discussing the proposals, councillors were broadly in favour of granting planning permission.East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing said: ldquoI have no problem with this application whatsoever. Itrsquos time the Ettrick Valley was brought into the st century.ldquoI absolutely think this is the right decision.Kelso and District councillor Simon Mountford also spoke in favour of the proposals: ldquoIrsquom delighted by this.

It was decided by those in high office that the gold-plated cockerel weather vane should be re-plated and that the Selkirk Town Clock should actually be removed for repair and cleaning. That clock and its illuminated front face were well maintained over many years by local jewellers and clock repairers and in more recent times has been well maintained by Ritchies in Edinburgh without recourse to actual removal from the building.This time the entire mechanismwas lowered by jib-crane and taken on a lorry down to England for a complete overhaul. That was fine and no-one noticed as the whole building was enveloped in scaffolding and plastic sheeting.However, when it didand was re-installed in its original place all was not what it seemed.In fact it has never kept time since it was put back in the Town Hall. Sometimes it simply doesnrsquot keep time, sometimes it doesnrsquot go at all and, even worse, it goes backwards!What happened to the role of Clerk of Works in all this turmoil and who signed off the work which was then proved to be faulty in the extreme with the steeple now leaking water where it had never leaked before and with huge double front doors that after ldquorestoration couldnrsquot be opened Is Selkirk actually taking a step back in time Are our Councillors backward Who knows, but come the Common Riding morning letrsquos hope Selkirk Silver Band big drummer John Nicol has a watch that keeps good time or neither the First Drum nor the Second Drum will ever take place!But in the middle of all this confusion I have recovered another great mystery, or is it mysteries What happened to the works of Selkirkrsquos mason-astronomer James Scott who was born in Midlem in  and died in November . Who was he and how did he acquire the title mason-astronomer  We have to rely on an interesting little booklet written by Bowmont Weddell, M.A., F.E.I.S and who was headmaster of Selkirk Public School in the s when he wrote and published the pare which was printed by Walter Thomson in High Street.James Scott was born at ldquoThe Burn in Midlem and followed his father and grand-father into the building trade as a stone-mason after school at Midlem.His hobby was the repairer of clocks and from that he became a builder of time-pieces and studied not just the time of day but also the universe and how it worked and related to time and movement.James was totally self-taught but among the books and manuscripts he read was a lecture paper by the City Astronomer of Edinburgh, William Peck. The stone-mason cum clock repairer got even more interested in the stars and planets and their movements to each other and became so knowledgeable that he could predict the phases of the moon and work out on a nightly basis where its place in the heavens would be.That saw him on a journey in which he designed and built, first of all, his ldquoGreat Clock which told the time accurately while at the same time represent the solar system and the relative movements of the stars and planets around the centre-piece, the sun. Included in this masterpiece are the signs of the Zodiac and through its  spaces this Great Clock tells the time, the placings of the planets and a pointer also displays the date and the year.He developed several clocks, long before the advent of digitisation and modern technology. Some of his works were famous and his Astronomical Clock formed a centre-piece of The Scottish Natural Exhibition in Edinburgh in .The ldquoGreat Clock and his elaborate but extremely accurate ldquoJupiter Clock which spelled out the movement of Jupiter and the rest of the planets in relation to the Sun and Earth, were kept locally and by the date that the Rector of Knowepark Public School, Mr Weddell, wrote his paper in  these valuable inventions were part of the fabric of Selkirk Town Hall, in custody of the people of Selkirk as a tribute and a memorial to a one-time stone mason and self-taught astronomer and clock maker, James Scott.The question is ldquowhere are they now They are obviously parts of Selkirkrsquos heritage and Selkirkrsquos past but also a glowing tribute to what can and should be done even today by people with the right attitude to their own environment.If a tin shed half way down The Green, built as a garage, can in any way be classed as Common Good Property and of any value to the burgh, then all efforts should be involved in finding out where these inventions of James Scott, the Selkirk Mason-Architect are now.These clocks are certainly worthy of the title Common Good property."},{"url":null,"title":"expect-cues-as-sporting-greats-set-for-book-festival","story":"SNOOKER legend Stephen Hendry canrsquot wait for this yearrsquos Borders Book Festival.The seven-time world champion leads a pack of sporting heroes appearing at the Melrose event next month.And he will be bringing the action from many World Championships to le as he discusses his book, Me and the Table.Hendry told us: ldquoI am really looking forward to come down to the Borders.ldquoIrsquove visited two or three times over the years to play snooker, but it has been so long since I was last there.ldquoThe book festival should be a really fun event.

sports pitches, were formulated last year.However, public consultation showed little appetite for any changes to be made.Dunbar Community Council received word on Monday evening that a further consultation was being planned, despite the apparent lack of interest in any alterations.George Robertson, community councillor and chair of Dunbar and East Linton Area Partnership , noted that there was no funding available to make any of the proposals happen.He said: ldquoIt is a wishlist of things ndash it is not going to be happening any time soon.ldquoThat is the long and the short of it.ldquoIf you are interested in the future of the park obviously come along to the meeting and have your say but do not expect anything to happen any time soon.Included among the ideas is the possibility of creating a ldquopavilion with toilets in the style of the pagoda recently demolished, as well as a series of paths and information cairns.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the community council, was ldquosurprised to receive an email highlighting an upcoming meeting, which is due to take place on Wednesday, where discussions will take place on the plans for the park.She pointed to the public consultation which took place last year in the townrsquos Bleachingfield Centre.At that time, a display featuring a series of images and information boards highlighted potential changes to the park, including new seating and picnic benches, as well as a maze and parkour course.Long-term aspirations also included the suggestion of creating a replacement pavilion with access to public toilets.Winterfield Pagoda, also known as Winterfield Pavilion, which had stood in the park since the s, was torn down by East Lothian Council in March .ldquoIn general, there was no massive enthusiasm for proposed changes, adding paths or parkour, or anything , said Mrs Swan.ldquoI was taken aback that East Lothian Council had seen fit to continue with a masterplan.Mrs Swan, who was previously DELAP chairwoman, also noted that budgets were increasingly tight at the local authority and funding would likely have to come from external organisations.She added: ldquoI still feel immediate priorities should be addressed first and scarce resources addressing immediate wishes of the community as expressed in the first instance.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said work to develop ldquoa programme of improvements for the park had been ongoing since .She said: ldquoFrom the outset it was made clear that financing any improvements would be challenging but that in itself was not justication for ignoring the need.ldquoThe benefit of having a masterplan in place means thatopportunity presented itself, either by way of outside funding or sources of materials, inidual elements of the plan could perhaps be delivered without detriment to the wider plan.ldquoThe council has used this model of planning very successfully on a number of other sites, the most recent being Ormiston Park where signicant improvements have been delivered.ldquoFollowing the most recent meeting to discuss the draft masterplan, the council was advised by the steering group that, although work was still required on what the plan should contain, the general principles of delivering improvements were still widely supported by the local community."},{"url":null,"title":"seven-year-old-praised-for-taking-action-to-stop-dog-fouling","story":"Seven-year-old Ava Lily Davidson, a P pupil at Stoneyhill Primary School, was inspired to make

Itrsquos a tiny hill, and many people walk past without noticing it, as nature has covered much of it under a blanket of overgrowth.But close up Irsquove always thought it appears mysterious. It is made up of agglomerate, which is the remains of volcanic ash all mixed up with bits of other rock and stone, then solidied and compressed over millions of years.But in places the agglomerate rock looks like it could be the ancient rubble built walls of an old ruined castle. Steps now lead to the summit, and despite the smallness of the hill, the view from the top is quite spectacular.I could see Fidra Island basking in a shimmering sea when I climbed it in the evening of Easter Monday. I reflected that Robert Louis Stevenson must have once stood on this exact spot as he viewed what many say was his inspiration for Treasure Island.But my purpose that beautul evening was to find lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo. There was a local tradition that a small cave-like cavity on the north side of Yellow Craig bore this name, and although the origin of the tradition is lost, it was clearly linked to William Wallace.I found reference to this tradition in an old account from over  years ago in the Haddingtonshire Advertiser by a Mr Jamieson. However, it was brought to my mind when I read of the refurbishment of the Wallace Monument. As part of this, there will be the Luumlbeck letter on display, written by Wallace and sent to the merchants of Luumlbeck in .Wallace, it seems, was in East Lothian at the time this letter was composed. And it was this connection that sparked my memory of the reference to lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo on Yellow Craig and set me on my quest.But it was in the dying embers of the day we arrived, and I had limited time to explore. The kids had fallen asleep in the car and I think my long-suffering we was content to relax while I scrambled around a rock at the tail end of a fun but exhausting day.As I headed through the wood alone to the craig, the sun was already beginning to lower its head. The sound of birdsong was a crescendo naturersquos melody for spring.Yellow Craig wood isnrsquot ancient, most trees are around  years old. But there are some, mostly sycamores, which are clearly much older. They have exotic shapes and their twisted limbs and scaled bark make them look like fossilised dragons. Perhaps they are. There is one which grows close to the play park that even looks like a serpent.These older trees give this wood an ancient feel. There are also Scots pines, mostly along the edge of the wood. They are descendants of the great Caledonian Forest which once covered most of the north of Scotland. Patches of emigrant Scots pine can be found all over East Lothian and at Yellow Craig they seem to guard the wood from northerly gales, and they are bent and shaped by the wind.Scots pines also stand guard at Yellow Craig itself. When I arrived I didnrsquot initially head up the steps but scrambled up the northern slope, looking for Wallacersquos Mutton Hole.The meaning of this term is a subject of debate, and I claim no academic authority, but I wonderit could come from the term lsquomootrsquo, which is an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning debate or discussion. A moot hall was a room for this purpose in a medieval building, but Wallace was a guerilla fighter, so could this meeting place have been his moot ha If this was so, perhaps Yellow Craig was a meeting place, where Wallace and his followers once met to discuss strategy. Could the idea of the letter to Luumlbeck have been decided here, as they cast their eyes across the sea from the vantage of the rock Itrsquos an interesting idea, but of course therersquos no historical evidence for it. Yet most of what actually happened in those times has no historical evidence.I couldnrsquot find the hole or hollow, as nature has claimed the slope and thick vegetation meant I was kept away from the recesses hidden behind. Perhaps winter would have been a better time to search.But I was not disappointed. I sat on the summit and my instinct told me there was a mystery here that remains untold. A scant and seemingly forgotten oral tradition is not much to go on. But often an ancient half-whispered tradition has grown from a seed of truth.There is a similar East Lothian connection to Wallace in the Garleton Hills. I have written of the Wallace Cave there and the traditions associated with it. There is enough connection to our national hero in East Lothian to say our landscape can also claim connection to him.I will search deeper for references to Wallacersquos Mutton Hole at Yellow Craig andmy findings to this pagemy search proves fruitful. But regardless of the results of this search, for me Yellow Craig will always be a place of magic contemplation and imaginative possibilities."},{"url":null,"title":"worlds-oldest-golf-scorecard-from-musselburgh-up-for-auction","story":"Estimated at pound,-,, the card, which has been framed and mounted, dates from December , .It shows that a Mr Cundell played the five holes within the Musselburgh race track twice, a total of  holes in  strokes.

It would seem that all of us like women athletes to excel physically but many of us expect them to do it only within the traditional parameters of how women should look.The typical male spectator probably likes it this way because,a woman athlete looks like a woman, there can be no question over his sexuality, but women athletes also appear to go along with it. Some of them have spoken about the pressure before events to do their hair and make-up so they look good ndash i.e. feminine. Others have made disgusting and prejudiced comments about Caster in private, based on how she looks. In the end, all of it underlines a depressing message to women from both men and women: be strong but not too strong be a great female athlete but remember to look sexy too.None of this is a new problem ndash just ask Martina Navratilova or Fatima Whitbread ndash but it may reflect the fact that sport has never really been the greatest friend of equality. For a start, itrsquos predicated on the idea of winning or losing menrsquos sport is also based on a proterozoic set of rules about masculinity, rule number one being you must fancy women, which is why therersquos still no openly gay man playing professional football in the UK. And kids who donrsquot fit in are still being forced on to the pitch to fail. My memory of games at school is about feeling inadequate and fearful. Sport never made me feel equal ndash quite the opposite.Those who would defend sport and the ruling against Caster Semenya ndash like those who defend the attempts to exclude trans women from womenrsquos sport or women-only spaces ndash say their position is based on science. But the science is just not that clear.For a start, not everyone has either XX or XY chromosomes and is therefore either clearly biologically female or male. That means you can try all you like to draw a clear line between men and women ndash and the sporting authorities are trying to do it with Semenya ndash but the line can never be arbitrary because neither biological sex nor gender is binary.Read more: Caster Semenya loses legal fight with IAAFThe position on testosterone is just as complicated. The sporting authority in Semenyarsquos case, the IAAF, says the testosterone in her body gives her an unfair advantage but the link between testosterone and athletic performance is far from clear it is also unclear how it inter-relates with other factors ndash height for instance or something more nebulous like talent. And testosterone is an unreliable indication of male and female anyway ndash almost one in five men have lower than average testosterone and some  per cent of women have higher than usual levels.But still the sporting authorities, and some feminists, and almost everyone who designs toilets and changing rooms try to stick to the old ways. They say theyrsquore doing it to defend womenrsquos rights ndash the right to take part equally in sport or the right to enter a women-only area free of the risk of an attack by a biological man ndash but this seems to me to misunderstand both the concept of equality and risk. In fact, there is no such thing as equality in sport ndash some people cheat, some people train harder, some are physically stronger, and some, such as Caster Semenya, have a great natural gt. Forcing Semenya to take drugs to lower her testosterone is not going to change any of that - Semenya herself says all she wants to do is to run naturally, the way she was born.The perceived risk to women from trans women, like the perceived threat to women in sport from athletes such as Semenya, is also monstrously exaggerated. Therersquos an idea that some trans womenwill sneak into female-only spaces and attack women. But not only is the risk vanishingly small, itrsquos a risk ndashlike any other ndash that society should manage for the sake of human rights.To use another example, we all know that therersquos a risk to children from paedophiles and other criminals, but we donrsquot therefore seek to ban all adult contact with children instead, we accept that the risk exists and, for the sake of a greater good, seek to manage it ndash and the same rules should apply to trans women who may commit crimes. Some of you may say the two issues ndash trans women and intersex woman ndash are dferent, but no: itrsquos all part of the same attack on the rights, visibility and representation of gay, trans and intersex people in public le ndash the attack on dference.Sadly, given the result of the Semenya case and the angry virulence of the critics of the Scottish Governments pro-trans legislation, I have to say I think the debate appears to be going in the wrong direction ndash you might even say the enemies of dference are in ascendance. Thankfully, there are some more progressive voices ndash a few female athletes have supported Semenya and the recent open letter from women supporting the right of trans women to self-identy was extremely heartening.However, in the end, Irsquom worried that the prejudice against Semenya ndash prejudice dressed up as biological truth ndash will embolden others. They will say itrsquos about equality and protecting womenrsquos rights, but itrsquos really about something deeper and darker: a fear of women who do not fit the traditional ideals, a suspicion of dference, and an existential horror at the idea that humanity ndash no matter how hard the people in charge of sport try ndash doesnrsquot fit into two neat boxes."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-gers-figures-not-valid-in-the-currency-debate","story":"Prof MacDonald bases his analysis on the ldquomassive current account deficit of  per cent of GDP which represents pound billion based on the latest Scottish Government statistics. One assumes the figures refer to the Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotlandstatistics for the period   which are based on Scotland being part of the UK and not as an independent country with vastly dferent priorities from the UK, such as HS, Trident and so on. It is widely recognised that many of the GERS figures are compiled by estimation , which is also acknowledged by the Fraser of Allander Institute. Furthermore, in a Herald article in December  it was stated ldquoGERS was conceived as a political, not as a statistical, exercise. We know this because the original correspondence from the then Secretary of State, Ian Lang, was leaked some years ago ndash he wanted it to undermine the other parties, saying this initiative could score against all of them.\"The current GERS figures are hardly an advertisement to remain part of the UK but it would be interestingan economist could produce GERS figures for an independent Scotland no longer part of the UK but using the same sort of estimates as GERS and of course the same crystal ball.Alan M Morris, Kirkhouse Road, Blanefield, Glasgow.NOT being a professor of Macroeconomics like Ronald MacDonald I am easily misled by figures taken from Government statistics, particularly those from disputed sources such as GERS.When Professor MacDonald refers to the UK current account deficit being four per cent while Scotlands runs at  per cent, what proportion of oil revenue does he apportion to Scotland in his calculation  Is it a  per cent share , or is it  per cent, which would be an independent Scotlands share John Jamieson, Craigie Road, Ayr.IT is always disappointing when a reply to a published letter misrepresents the original, but particularly when the replyrsquos author is a respected professor in onersquos alma mater .Professor MacDonald never actually challenges any of the points in my letter of May . First, that the value of the pound is in long-term decline. Secondly, that the UKrsquos chronic balance of payments deficit is chronic. Thirdly, that HMRCrsquos Regional Trade Statisticsshow the UKrsquos trade deficit with the rest of the world is disproportionately due to England. In that sense only Scotland had a surplus, though that does not include North Sea oil as RTS treats that as a UK export. Lastly, that continuing with the pound would mean further decline.If Scottish electors are to make an informed choice between a Scottish currency and the pound, then a full understanding is needed of both. However, Prof MacDonald writes only of the claimed chaos and disaster of a Scottish currency while the alternative reality of the pound is never mentioned, far less discussed. However, given its continuous decline, and chronic balance of payments deficit, that is hardly surprising.He insists the current deficit on trade could not be financed by foreign reserves from an independence settlement, so ldquothere would be a considerable excess demand for foreign exchange on currency markets, and as in any market, the price of foreign exchange would have to rise which, in turn, implies a sharp devaluation of any Scottish currency. Eventhis came about to a signicant degree, it is still at least similar to what I have shown for the pound. A loss of  per cent of value against the euro in  years is rather more than a fluctuation.He also points to the ldquoimplications [a ldquosharply depreciated Scottish pound] would have for mortgages, pensions and other financial assets and liabilities asthis never happened to the pound.

The council’s Infrastructure Services Committeeapproved the kerbside collection policy and procedures last year, including guidance on how to deal with contaminated bins. Any non-recyclable material placed into the recycling bin is classed as ‘contamination’, which could spoil the recyclates in any load. The recycling reprocessor may then reject whole loads as a result. Any rejected loads of recycling are disposed of at an additional cost to the taxpayer, for which there is no council budget available. Income which they would have generated to invest in services is lost.Collection crews will now visually check each recycling bin for contaminated recycling before emptying as a matter of course – those with severe contamination will not be emptied. Households consistently presenting severely contaminated bins will be offered advice and support to properly separate their waste. Those who ignore that advice could run the risk of their recycling bin being removed.Moderately contaminated bins will be emptied and an orange tag will be attached, providing information to the householder on how to properly use the recycling service. If a bin has not been emptied and tagged explaining why it has not been emptied, it is contaminated and the offending materials must be removed before the next collection. Crews will notto empty a rejected bin until the next scheduled collection day for the same bin.Bins considered to have little or no levels of contaminants will be emptied as normal.Collection crews will keep a record of bins unemptied due to overloading or contamination and this will be checked before a decision is made toto empty any bin reported as a missed collection.For those with a lot of recyclable materials, additional, free recycling bins can be requested by contacting the council’s Wasteline. Additional non-recyclable waste bins may also be authorised where there is a genuine need following a home visit and assessment by a Community Waste Officer. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Police Scotland\"  Police urge revellers to be safe and responsible viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"The council’s Head of Roads, Waste and Landscape services, Philip McKay, said: “It’s important residents understand how to recycle properly and make best use of the facilities available to them. “Sending waste to landfill costs more than double the amount it costs to recycle and tackling the levels of contamination in kerbside bins is intended to reduce the amount of recyclates sent to landfill.“We will be enforcing the procedures in a staggered rollout, tackling problem routes first. This will allow crews to get used to the new procedures without any severe implications for the collection schedule.”Over half the materials in local non-recyclable waste bins are recyclable through existing services – equating to around , tonnes of recyclable materials being landfilled at a cost of £.million a year.Not only does maximising the value of a material benefit the environment, it also frees up money for other essential council services.Residents are encouraged to get in touch with the Recycling and Waste Aberdeenshire Facebook pagethey are unsure of how to dispose of any material not listed in the A-Z guide.For any recycling and waste related queries, or to request an additional recycling or non-recycling bin, please contact Wasteline."},{"url":null,"title":"occasional hours licence for brewdog","story":"An Aberdeenshire licensing authority has narrowly paved the way for the anticipated opening of BrewDog#s new #, Inverurie bar and restaurant next month.Despite the brewing giants not possessing a provisional licence, Aberdeenshire Central Licensing Board took the highly unusual step of granting two occasional licences to enable it to open in the former Mitchell’s Dairy premises on Market Street.Some  new staff can now be employed at the bar which will see the number of BrewDog employees in Aberdeenshire soar to more than .BrewDog retail director James Brown told the board the firm had made “a huge commitment to Inverurie and Aberdeenshire” and afterwards said he was “delighted” with the decision which will initially allow the bar to operate from May  to .The company’s full licence application is currently being fast-tracked by the council after delays incurred due to the installation of a new data system and subsequent backlog.Under the agreement after a close - vote by licensing board members, the bar has been limited to operating from am to  midnight Sunday to Thursday and from am to am Friday and Saturday but only while former BrewDog Tap Room manager Craig Cargill is on the premises. Off-sales have been approved from am to pm Monday to Sunday.However, among ious conditions imposed by the licensing standards team, it was also agreed that the outdoor space to the rear of the premises will not be utilised by customers until a full licence is granted.The licensing board heard from Audrey Junner of agents Hill Brown Licensing that BrewDog had no intention to trade by way of occasional licences for an extended period of time.She added: “We would like to reassure members that a provisional premises licence has been submitted… for the avoidance of doubt my clients wholly accept that no assumptions can be made about the grant of that provisional licence.“They have undertaken the fit-out works at the business entirely at their own risk.”But licensing standards officer Lisa Gordini reminded the board that while a provisional licence had been applied for, it would not be discussed until the board’s June meeting and could receive representations or objections which could impact on BrewDog’s operation.She maintained there was an argument that the board should not be granting any occasional licences which may “conflict with the consultation process” of the provisional licence application.After considerable debate, board member Robbie Withey proposed refusal of the application, saying the authority expected a six-month consultation period to process applications and that the company – which operates  bars around the world – should have applied sooner.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Andy Beattie will be honoured with a new road named after him at Midmill Business Park\"  Honour for football manager viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"But admitting that the application was “a dficult one”, Gwyneth Petrie proposed making an “absolute exception” to usual practice and proposed approval."},{"url":null,"title":"pitcairn dominates thainstone breeding sale","story":"A Limousin cross British Blue heer and its heer calf sold for the top price at Aberdeen and Northern Marts# annual show and sale of commercial beef breeding cattle at Thainstone, sponsored by East Coast Viners.The animals from regular consignors, Craig and Katreen Malone, Pitcairn, Lochgelly, Cardenden, Fe, sold for £,.Champion in the pre-sale show judged by Will MacDonald, Tormore, Dunbeath and Kris Sutherland, Dunbeath Farms, Dunbeath, this heer was originally bought as a bulling heer from William and David Moir of Moir Livestock, Fraserburgh, while the heer calf is by Lodge Hamlet.The outfit sold for the lead price of £ to Dunbeath Farms, Dunbeath, Caithness.Craig and Katreen also scooped the reserve champion honours with a Limousin cross heer bred by Tom Howden, Stanley Farms.

The online poll is available on Orkney Islands Council’s website www.orkney.gov.ukA shortlist has been drawn up by OIC Marine Services which features prominent figures from the county’s history, plus the name of a previous pilot launch:The design and build contract for the new -metre pilot vessel was secured after a competitive tendering exercise by Astilleros Armon S.A, which has its main base in Northern Spain.The vessel will join the two pilot launches currently operated by Marine Services. The naming ceremony is planned for September .Graham Sinclair, chairman of the council’s development and infrastructure committee, said: “Like the celebrated explorer John Rae, some fitting names from Orkney’s past feature on the shortlist for the new vessel and I would encourage folk to take part in the poll.“With harbour business thriving in Orkney, this is an opportune time to replace an ageing pilot launch with a more modern, capable, and reliable vessel. Like her predecessors, she will give us the capability to deliver a -hour, year-round pilotage service in the very challenging waters around Orkney. This greatly benefits the economy of our islands.“I look forward to the outcome of the vote and hope that as many folk as possible take this opportunity to choose the name for a vessel that will become a familiar sight in local waters.”As well as the online poll, you can send your preferred name from the shortlist by post to Pilot Vessel Poll, Harbour Authority Building, Old Scapa Rd, Scapa, Kirkwall KW SD. If you submit a postal vote, please include your name and phone number.The poll closes on Tuesday, May . A winner will be drawn from the votes for the most popular name, invited to take part in September’s naming ceremony and offered the opportunity of a family trip at a later date aboard the new pilot launch.Brian Archibald, Harbour Master and Head of Marine Services, Engineering and Transportation, said: “We look forward to the delivery and naming ceremony for our new pilot launch.“Orkney continues to benefit from a signicant upturn in harbour related activity, making it essential that we invest in the equipment and vessels necessary to deliver a safe and efficient service.“Our pilot launches play a vital role at the heart of our harbours operations. They enable marine pilots to embark and disembark from vessels heading to and from berths and anchorages within the Orkney Harbours area. These operations take place day and night in all weathers # the pilot launches need to be highly capable vessels built to high specications of sea keeping and reliability.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

With new surfacing laid over the last week, the council say that a short time will be required for the surface to cure, with the streets to reopen to traffic on Friday at the latest.The works are part of the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative’sPlaces and Spaces project, which include changes to the area at the bottom of the Strynd and top of Castle Street, as well as providing a new path to the War Memorial on the Kirk Green.With the initial phase of the project now completed, works will be suspended for the main summer season. Plans are for work to move to the entrance to Victoria Street in the autumn, being suspended again in December for Christmas shopping season.The Places and Spaces initiative was developed alongside community groups such as the Kirkwall and St Ola Community Council and the Kirkwall BID, who identied key areas of the town where it was felt improvements could be made. According to OIC, proposed improvements were the positively received by the Orkney community during a two-day consultation period, where  per cent of those who attended said they supported the proposals,  per cent were against and the rest were undecided.The Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative is a five-year heritage-based grant scheme which seeks to deliver sustainable improvements to the built heritage of the Kirkwall Conservation Area, in an effort to regenerate the centre of Kirkwall for the benefit of local communities and businesses, as well as to attract visitors.

The council say that all profit would stay in the islands, enabling the local authority to preserve and enhance key services that local people value and depend upon. This, OIC believes, will provide a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.The council hopes that developments will allow it to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a Needs Case for a new interconnector for Orkney, thereby substantially supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney, including future development of the marine energy sector.OIC believes that the wider economic development value of a new cable to Orkney could be highly signicant, particularlya substantial proportion of local ownership can be secured — which could help employment and income remain in the county.Plans for a development of up to around MW in Hoy were announced to the local community last year — with sites for a development of up to MW on the island of Faray and up to MW on shoreside farmland at Quanterness outside Kirkwall now also being investigated.The proximity of the project at Quanterness to Kirkwall could also enable a separate private wire network project in which the council could directly supply electricity to its own buildings as a means to reduce costs.Public engagement events have been organised for Kirkwall, Eday and Rendall over the coming fortnight. Proposed plans for the developments will be on display at these, with elected members and council officers on hand to discuss the plans with members of the public. The proposed Quanterness site has the potential capacity for six m blade tip height turbines. The site on Faray has enough space for up to eight m blade tip height turbinesThe event details are as follows:An event will also be held in Westray, with the date yet to be confirmed.The current proposal at the third site in Hoy is to erect seven turbines, compared to the  presented in the original plans.The proposals for each site are expected to evolve as further site investigation work and consultation is undertaken. Site investigations, including bird and telecommunications studies, will be ongoing at all three sites.The council#s intention is to reach planning permission stage by the end of , ensuring all views and issues are fully explored and considered before any final decisions are made.  Proposals for how the applications will be determined are currently being considered.Councillor James Stockan, Orkney Islands Council leader said: “It is vital that the Council now takes an active ‘developer approach’ to energy projects in our islands. Not only does this allow us to maximise the resources available to us in the islands to support services and projects for local people, but it also allows us to contribute signicantly and in a meaningful way to allow our world-renowned local energy industry to survive and thrive through a new grid connection.“Our strategy is one that meets uncertainty head-on. The final details of proposals are by no means set in stone whilst investigations are carried out at the three sites, nor are all three sites guaranteed planning permission — and of course we also wish to take into account public opinion on the developments. Widening the net and moving to investigate three separate sites, allows us a degree of flexibility in the make-up of the final outcome.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Or the crisis in our hospitals. Or the crisis on our railways.: Poll: Only  in  Scots want  indyref voteFor the SNP, it is independence first, second and always.No matter how loud the applause in the Edinburgh International Conference Centre is this weekend, Nationalist politicians would do well to understand that their own priorities are at odds with the people of Scotland.: MSPs say concerns raised about changes to gender act are ‘misleading’We know this from the latest opinion polling published this week.Voters were asked to rank issues in order of which they thought should be the most important for the Scottish Government to prioritise.The NHS was ranked in the top three by  per cent of respondents, with the cost of living on  per cent, the economy on  per cent, and education on  per cent.Constitutional affairs and independence scored just nine per cent.I suspect you would get a very dferent resultyou surveyed SNP delegates at the EICC, which just shows how out of touch with reality the SNP has become.While they talk among themselves, the message from the public is clear: get on with the day job.: Kenny MacAskill: Sturgeon did NOT just call for independence referendum by The First Minister could start by fixing the mess her Government has made of our once-envied education system.It emerged this week that some schools are having to teach pupils studying for National , National  and Higher qualications in the same class.An obsession with the constitution means a generation of children is being let down by this Government.Amid this crisis, the idea that we should spend the next two years having yet another debate about independence is the height of irresponsibility.But that is precisely what Nicola Sturgeon wants to do. She wants to ide the country once again and hold an unwanted second independence referendum before .How do we know it’s unwanted  Because the people of Scotland have said so.Only one-in-five voters support the SNP’s reckless plan to hold another contest before the next Holyrood election.People remember the ision and the toxic atmosphere from  and they don’t want to go through that again any time soon.And they certainly don’t want to go through it while the country is still ided over Brexit.Whatever your views on Brexit, we can all agree that it has revealed just how dficult and complex it is to leave a political union.The UK has only been in the EU for four decades, and it is a much looser partnership of countries than the United Kingdom is.: Nicola Sturgeon ‘facing rebellion’ over post-independence currency plansJust imagine how dficult it would be to tear Scotland out of a centuries-old union in which we are considerably more entwined.It’s little wonder that so many people who voted ‘Yes’ in  have changed their minds. According to this week’s poll, a third would now vote to remain in the UK.Despite campaigning every day since September , the SNP has managed to turn more people off independence. Support for leaving the UK now stands at just  per cent.Most Scots know that we are stronger together and want to build a successful economic future based on our shared culture, history and institutions. Institutions such as our currency – the pound.Today, the SNP will vote to scrap the pound and adopt a new currency in an independent Scotland, putting salaries, mortgages and pensions at risk. According to the polling figures published today, that is supported by just  per cent of voters – while  per cent want to keep the pound.By remaining in the UK, we can keep our pound, grow our economy – without extra red tape for businesses – and use a stable currency backed by the strength of the UK’s central bank and its  million taxpayers.But, instead, today’s conference debate will focus on when to inflict economic harm on communities: immediately in the short-term or after a few years.And it will be coupled with the SNP’s growth commission blueprint which confirms breaking up the UK would lead to even deeper austerity.This isn’t the future most people want for Scotland. It’s not a choice we should have to make.We don’t want another independence referendum.We don’t want to create further ision and have a debate about whether to erect barriers between our friends, families and neighbours in the rest of the UK.But I know the SNP will never drop its narrow nationalist agenda. It will never stop campaigning for separation.So that is why those of us who believe in solidarity must continue to campaign as well. We speak for the majority of Scots who want a Government focused on building a better future for the people of Scotland as part of the UK.We must continue campaigning so that Nicola Sturgeon stops listening only to Nationalists and starts listening to the nation.Pamela Nash is chief executive of Scotland in Union©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"key data may have already been deleted in alex salmond case","story":"Key data relating to the Scottish Governments collapsed harassment probe into Alex Salmond may already have been \"deleted\", the Scottish Governments top civil servant has suggested.Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans has told MSPs that \"automated systems\" mean that civil servants emails are deleted after  months.

A total of  per cent want another referendum in the future, but not within the next decade. While  per cent want one within the next two to five years,  per cent want one within the next five to ten years and  per cent did not know.The online survey asked the opinion of , adults across Scotland.The First Minister told MSPs on Wednesday that new legislation would be brought forward at Holyrood by the end of the year, which would provide the framework for a second vote. But any prospect of the UK government repeating the granting of a Section  order, which would allow Scottish ministers to hold a legally binding vote, was ruled out by Mr Lidington.“We don’t see any evidence that there is a demand from the people of Scotland to review the decision they took in ,” he said. “That referendum was said at the time to settle matters for a generation.“We don’t see that a Section  order is called for. I don’t see how it would help put right problems with Scottish schools and hospitals.“Devolution in Scotland has given many additional powers to the Scottish Parliament and some of those powers have not even be used. So I think there is plenty more that can be done in terms of the Scottish Government using the powers that are already there.”Askedhe would rule out granting a Section  order before , the minister said: “We have made it very clear we don’t think that is justied.”The First Minister indicated the Scottish Government would hold off requesting a Section  order. While Mrs May’s administration has ruled out granting one, the Prime Minister is widely expected to stand down in the coming monthsa Brexit deal can be secured. Mr Lidington refused to speculate on whether a new Tory government would be more likely to grant the order. The minister’s remarks were seized on by the SNP, with the party’s Westminster leader describing them as an “arrogant diktat”.Ian Blackford said: “Scotland’s future cannot and will not be decided by the arrogant diktat of this shambles of a Tory government, which has been rejected by Scottish voters at every election and which is soon likely to be out of office.“Whatever people’s views on independence, a strong majority of people back the Scottish Parliament’s right to determine the nation’s future.“Overwhelmingly, it is Holyrood – not Westminster – which the people of Scotland believe should have the right to decide this country’s democratic path.“The Westminster system is broken beyond repair and does not serve Scotland’s interests – something now conceded at senior levels in the Scottish Tory ranks.” But the Scottish Conservatives said the new polling proved there was no demand for another referendum.The Survation poll found more people were in favour of Scotland remaining in the UK than leaving. Askeda referendum was held on the question “should Scotland remain in the United Kingdom or leave the United Kingdom ”,  per cent said they would vote remain and  per cent said they would vote leave.More respondentssaid leaving the UK would be worse for Scotland’s economy than Brexit, while  per cent thought it would be better. A further  per cent said it would be no better or worse and  per cent said they did not know.Scottish Conservative chief whip Maurice Golden said: “No matter what the SNP says, support for independence simply hasn’t risen since .“That’s all the evidence Nicola Sturgeon should need to take this threat off the table.“But instead she ploughs on, ensuring Scotland is subjected to yet more ision and uncertainty.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.Common heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.Changing colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.From the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first. Maybe its powers of protection will rub off on you!"},{"url":null,"title":"li","story":"The Liberal Democrats claimed by far the highest number of Shetland votes in Thursday#s European elections, gaining roughly twice the number of nearest rivals the SNP.However, the isles# effort was unable to save the Euro seat of Lib Dem George Lyon, who was likely to be replaced at Brussels by UKIP#s David Coburn.Returning officer Jan-Robert Riise at the European Election count.

I always thought it would but it#s possibly exceeded my expectations.#I#m extremely delighted for George Lyon and just hope that it can be replicated down through the country.#George Lyon is a very, very good MEP, interested in the rural areas, and I just hope he gets back again.# raquoShetland#s slide to the right in the past few years reflects what is going on nationally and internationally, but needs study.yuns de longest contribution yet Brian, du better hae a mandatory rest period noo ta big desel up ageen.UKIP got the seat,great news !I wonderhe#ll be like the outgoing Yorkshire UKIP man who hardly attended any debates in the parliament, or like the new one, who#s said this morning he won#t attend at all Lets hope we learn not to be so apathetic, we literally get what we deserve. Salmond and Farage, the opposite sides of a nasty #nationalist# coin.And what of British Nationalists Mr Tinkler For example Michael Gove yesterday, banning #Of Mice  Men# and #To Kill a Mockingbird# from school reading lists in England.Can you imagine the SNP doing likewise because the want -% of literature studied to be Scottish Inconceivable.For whatever reason British nationalism # incredibly, even in the form of UKIP # isn#t sneered at the same way as Scottish nationalism.What is your point Carl  Scotland is somehow superior to England because it does not ban “Of Mice  Men” and “To Kill a Mockingbird” from school reading lists. How very petty of you. For information I loathe all nationalism, Scottish, British what is the dference, just raw tribalism by another name.SNP, UKIP, Scottish Independence, United Kingdom Independence, as I said, two sides of a very nasty littlecoin.How verySad andironic, the Scots# inScotland have just elected a UKIP MEP!! I#m glad to hear it Ian.So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration You mean you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century  Nation-states have existed throughout human history and patriotism # or nationalism # is a normal part of human social experience, as evidenced in innumerable great artistic works, for example. Where things go wrong is where one nation-state wants to conquer and control others. But that has a dferent name: imperialism.Well Carl, when it comes to education and this of literature, I would rather have a book written by a british,not scottish, author than this of an american, in which to study or reflect on with regard to literary works used for educational purposes. Quite rightly, these books, written by foreigners##sorry, yanks, should be taken out of the national curriculum and author#s unique to the UK or Scotland selected instead. I must confess, I am a little worried and concerned about the UKIP doing so well in the European Election#s considering Mr Farrage is a more extreme version of the vile Tories, and how he gives the impression of a nationalist, xenophobic buffoon where, I feel,we do leave the EU, he will, like the vile Tories, be in a position to rule and do as he pleases without being answerable to anybody, namely the EU under the European Human Rights Act. Many people may criticize the EHRA, but I would dread to think what this country would be like without it     David, you never fail to amaze me.You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner and then go on to criticise nationalism and xenophobia.You really do believe in taking the scatter gun approach to political philosophy.Without the European Human Rights Act there would be an awful lot less terrorists running round for a start, old hook hands would of been deported along with his pals years ago, The   tube an bus bombings may never of taken place, an Cherie Blair would have a few less £millions in the bank. Any and all of these options are preferable to what we have now.At the last general election when the Lib Dems signed a pact with the Conservatives the writing was on the wall, they blew it big time and will never in the future be able to have an influence on British politics.Maybethey had made a coalition with Labour it might have been dferent but now its too late, any vote for Liberal in the future will be a vote wasted.The study of English literature should, in my view, encompass all literature written in the English language, including its many dialects and historic iations. That should include studying local writers, but not to the exclusion of international authors.We study literature for all sorts of reasons, but bolstering national pride or trashing another nation shouldn#t be amongst them.If we were to go down the road of only studying our own literature, Scots students would never study Shakespeare or Dickens, English students would never study Burns or Lewis Grassic Gibson, neither would study Melville or Twain, and all would be worse off for it.The attack on the English curriculum has come from the dreadful Michael Gove, but it could quite easily have come from Nigel Farage who hates hearing non-English accents, let alone reading non-English texts.UKIP under Farage represents a severely authoritarian threat to our liberty which should not be under-estimated. So far we#ve only seen the tip of this particular iceberg.Farage is married to a German so he hears a foreign accent every day, such a pity you only soak up what murdochs media tell you instead of a few facts.How very true John, they, the LibDems, know how to go out with a bang##so to speak. A prime example of# not what to do in a political career # lolGod forbidthe Libdemsshould go into bed with UKIP, I think that would most certainly put a stake into the heart of the party lol Mind you, lets hope that UKIP do not get to that level of power where a they rule the roost or b contemplate a coalition with another party.I do believe they are in the same league as the Tories with regard to the Scottish Parliament, in that they have  single representative####.. too many in my books lol# you never fail to amaze me. You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner # lol Malcolm, I was being slightly sarcastic in my response to what literature teachers should be using to teach with ###.but on a more serious point, I do not see why teachers cannot use books written by scottish or british authors to demonstrate literature and its meaning##..within and between the lines. I am sure, as you might agree, there is just as equally good examples of literature within the boundaries of our own country or the UK in which to use for educational purposes  I wasn#t specically saying every foreign book should be banned##.it was, as said sarcastically, yank#..sorry, american in the context of the subject.Theo Smith and the other  Shetland Lib-Dem voters might explain why they like it so much. But they won#t.Are you unable to express your own views Brian  because that link is your longest post by far.Carl Pickard, in answer to # Ian. So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration # I am strongly forUnity of all humanity, that does not mean I carte blancheagree with of all the attemptsand mechanisms to forge those unities by politicians. However the EU is a vast improvement of what went before it. WW and WW were the result of the preceding collection of sovereign nation states.On balance I there for do support the EU, however there are grounds to improve it, not demolish it. I most definitely agree with immigration and the opening of borders to all friendly states and cultures..Britain has benefited hugely due to its ersity of cultures.If anyone advocates banning immigration and sending #them# home, would they expect all UK and Scottish ex pats to be expelled from wherever they are and be sent backThat would be fun would it not I would expect to be deportedfrom whatever country I was in other than my ownI broke their laws. I would not expect that country to feed clothe and house me, nor would I expect free everything, maybe that#s just me as I don#t expect this country to do that for me either . Instead of hysterical rantings of they want to send them all back try actually listening to what they say instead of what the murdoch media say they say.A new experience # Iagree with Ian Tinkler.Robert Sim, in answer to # you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century# I certainly do loath the primitive mentality which is soblind and stupid to realise most of human suffering is simply because Nation States and nationalistsare collectively too selfish to look beyond theirown self interest and belief in racial superiority.. Nationalism is a prime example of that and Salmond and his NATS a great example. Our oil, we are better, fairer, alone we would be wealthier, ect,ect and all that self righteous rubbish. Also nationalism goes a bit beyond great artistic works, a few examples : The Holocaust ,Omagh bombing , Bloody Sunday. Ethnic cleansing . Tribal massacresCambodian genocide , these are a few examples of hundreds of incidents..These killings have little to do with imperialism, more about tribalism and a self belief in racial superiority. #The simple fact is we are all the same species with exactly the same ancestry and emotions.# Very true, Ian. In fact, your words remind me of these words from a famous historical document: #We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal##.

He began his career in  as a Chemistry Teacherin Wallace High School, moving to Regent House School where he later was appointed Head of Chemistry and then to the Principalship of Rathfriland High School. From his early career,Simon excelled not only as a vibrant and engaging classroom teacher, but also as the leader of the largest Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme in the Province whilst at Regent House.Simon brought to Portadown College this lelong passion for adventure and outdoor pursuits by participating in Duke of Edinburgh expeditions and instilling a love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures.A hallmark of Simon’s Principalship was his heartfelt interest in students and staff as iniduals. So as to ensure that each knew their value, he was always ready to offer a gentle word of encouragement and would urge them to, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for”.Regardless of background, belief or personal circumstances, students, staff and parents were received with a warm smile and a sincere willingness to work towards a positive outcome. In all such situations, Simon gave of his time generously and graciously, always setting aside his own priorities to support others.Simon was a strong educational leader with distinctive values which he brought to a range of challenging situations. As a College community, we are indebted to him for the dedication and industry he demonstrated in working alongside the Board of Governors to advocate for the Dickson Plan, consistently placing students at the heart of his educational vision.A man of strong personality and principles, Simon espoused high standards in allaspects of College le and never once shied away from any criticism this might have attracted.Simon’s service to education in Northern Ireland extended beyond Portadown College and included holding office in the Craigavon Area Learning Community, Association of ControlledGrammar Schools and the Post-Primary Principal’s Association. His long standing career had also involved acting as Chief Examiner for A Level Chemistry with the CCEA.A passionate traveller who enjoyed adventures in the most far-flung corners of the globe,Simon was ever keen to share his experiences with students and staff alike, encouraging each and every one to get out into the world, savour its magnicence and seize every opportunity. One of Simon’s most distinctive qualities was that he never lost a childlike sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world. He took particular delight in his garden at the foothills of the Mountains of Mourne and regularly enjoyed walking these hills with his much loved Irish Deerhound companions, Oisin and Uther.Current and former students will remember with fondness his infectious sense of fun and wicked humour, from his cameo roles in College charity events to a starring role in “PC Happy”. In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A man of eclectic taste, Simon derived considerable joy from art and music of all genres - classical, Irish folk and contemporary. Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance.Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.Students and staff alike will hold dear the sentiment of Simon’s final Easter Assembly, inspired by his many visits to Coventry Cathedral, in which he spoke on the theme of Forgiveness and the message of Hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus themes deeply important to Simon and ones which he sought to enact in his daily le.As a College community, our loss is immeasurable. However, we will endeavour to uphold the College Motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” in Simon’s memory:May the road rise up to meet you.May the wind be always at your back.May the sun shine warm upon your facethe rains fall soft upon your fieldsand until we meet again,may God hold you in the palm of His hand."},{"url":null,"title":"yfc get on their bike with 75km for 75 years","story":"Rathfriland Young Farmers Club are set to kick off their th anniversary celebrations with a bang this weekend.The club are delighted to announce their first event to commemorate the milestone anniversary with a sponsored cycle challenge.

The play tells of the journey of two Belfast women set against the backdrop of the crumbling Floral Hall as they recall the fateful night they met their future musician husbands. Old grudges and sparks fly as they reminisce about the lestyles of their globetrotting other halves who experienced fame and fortune while the wives they left behind struggled to bring up their young families, working all day and spending countless lonely nights. Written and directed by Brenda Winter-Palmer, the production has been developed by West Belfast actress Antoinette Morelli, daughter of showband legend Tony. Inbetween a quick rehearsal break, Antoinette spoke passionately to the Andersonstown News about how she has haboured the project for the past  years and how proud she is to see it come to fruition on The MAC stage next week. “I’m in a wee bit of shock and obviously incredibly excited that it’s got to this stage,” she said. “Brenda had heard my story about daddy and it turned out that Brenda’s daddy was Micky Conlon, a big concert promoter at that time. I commissioned Brenda three years ago to write the piece.“We had a read through last year in the Strand cinema as part of the Eastside Arts festival. David Hull the promoter was invited, he picked it up and this is where we are.”Antoinette plays the character of Rose, “a character that has been inspired by mum’s stories but is not my mum”. “The story is fictionalised and it’s about two couples, two sisters and the impact the showbands have on their lives,” she said. Antoinette continued: “With the Miami Showband story out this year and this production the stories are similar in terms of the showband connection but this is very much from the women’s perspective. “It’s tragic, it’s funny, there are a lot of good treats in there with music from the showband era. The universal heartbeat of the play is our story, the sacrices women made to let their men go off and pursue their dreams. “The Floral Hall is almost its own character in the play, after last year’s reading we had so many people come up to say ‘oh we met there’, people have such good memories of the place.“I know how dficult it is now, in terms of performing, first hand, as my husband is a stay-at-home dad to our -year-old and -month-old. If it wasn’t for him doing that I couldn’t pursue my career so I’m lucky that is he very supportive. I definitely think people will identy with the show.”Keep Telling Me Lies will be performed at The MAC theatre from Thursday May  until Sunday May .

Find out when the exams are and get the advice that the schools give out, but don’t waste your energy following rumours about what the grade is. It’s better to spend your time helping your child.It’s always worth practising. Whatever schools say, it’s worth it. Children can improve their performance by  -% by careful practice.Start earlyyou can, but don’t worryyou haven’t. Ideally it is best to start preparation for the Transfer Test exam at least one year ahead. However, don’t panicyou don’t have that much time even a few weeks can make a dference.Make a simple action plan. However long you’ve got, have a clear, simple strategy. There are two key principles: . Start from your child’s present level of knowledge. . Help your child to learn from their mistakes.Motivation, motivation, motivation! You have to take your child with you on this journey. A simple rewards system can be highly effective.Don’t just practice. There’s a tendency to think that just practising one test after anther will do the trick. It’s far more important to learn from mistakes. Going through the test afterwards with your child and filling in the the gaps in learning is crucial.Stay calm, manage stress, build confidence. Don’t talk about the Transfer test all the time. Use breaks, treats and bite-sized learning sessions to keep things fresh. Be realistic about your child’s potential. Pass or fail, it’s important to try to make this process a positive one.Manage the exam day. Make sure that you have everything ready for the day, that your child tries to get a good night’s sleep, eats breakfast and gets there in good time.How and when to use our testsIt’s best to use them as real exam practice. These tests are mock exams. They are set out in a style as close as possible to the real thing – though the format will y from year to year. It is best to use them as authentic exam experience rather than for general practice. Follow the instructions and advice in the sections before starting the test.What a score means and how to boost itIt is unfortunately impossible to say that a certain score can guarantee a pass in the actual exams. However, we suggest that a score of % would be a standard to aim at. It is important not to present this to your child as a concrete benchmark though, as the best motivator for them is to see the scores going up. Here are some tried and tested tips for improvement.Go over any incorrect answers. Always go over incorrect answers so that your child can see what went wrong. To help with this process, some of our harder Maths questions are explained.Use an action planner inside. This will provide a plan for what to do next when a test has been marked.Improve basic exam technique. Work on improving speed, working efficiently – coming back to trickier questions later – and pacing within the time limit.Improve general English skills. Ensure the foundations are strong enough. Use a range of checklists to help reinforce your child’s English skills.Target what is not fully understood. The secret is not to keep blindly practising but to target the areas of English Maths that your child is weakest in.

It was claimed they would then have to justy their excess speed to bosses or,a collision occurred, could face criminal charges.Last night, the Police Federation for Northern Irelandsaid it was concerned that PSNI officers could be \"left behind\"Northern Ireland was excluded.The Home Office carried out a public consultation on proposals to introduce a new legal test for police officers facing possible criminal charges after a high-speed chase. The changes would mean an officers driving is compared to that of a competent police driver with the same level of training performing the same role, rather than a member of the public. They also aim to apply to all police officers trained to response driver level as well as advanced driver level, covering those pursuing criminals and also emergency police responders.Mr Javid said: \"Its vital police officers feel confident and protected when pursuing suspects on the roads or responding to an emergency. \"Its also crucial that we send a clear message that criminals ... cannot escape arrest simply by driving recklessly. \"These proposed changes will strike the right balance - giving trained officers the confidence they need to fight crime effectively and ensure our roads are safe.\" Mark Lindsay, who chairs the PFNI, said PSNI officers \"need to know that they will not be penalised for the efforts they make to apprehend wrongdoers\".\"For too long, there has been something of a grey area for officers when it comes to pursuits and the steps now set out by the Home Secretary will give direction, clarity as well as the necessary legislative cover,\" he said.\"Unfortunately, we will have to wait until we have a restored Executive and Assembly before similar legislation can be enacted in Northern Ireland. \"On that basis, we may end up seeing officers in England and Wales given added protection while their counterparts here are left behind. \"This would be regrettable, but without ing devolved structures, its dficult to see how there could be any other outcome.\"The Department for Infrastructureis the organisation responsible for road traffic law in Northern Ireland. A spokeswoman said last night: \"We will be following developments but any decisions to follow suit would be a matter for an incoming DfI minister and a restored Executive.\"PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said: \"We understand that this issue is being looked at nationally. \"Changes in law are a matter for politicians, however, and we will engage in any consultation should one be brought forward.\""},{"url":null,"title":"tributes to fisherman andrew hay who lost life in accident on boat","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Thursdays poll will be the first elections for which registering online has been an option and has led to the surge in voter numbers. Electronic registration was rolled out here on June  last year, the aim being to make it even easier for people to register to vote. The process takes less than five minutes and involves filling out some personal details in a short online form. Paper registration forms are still available for those unable or unwilling to register to vote digitally, and can be ed to a local election office.Around % of applications to vote i have been made online since the new system was introduced last summer.

But are they continuing to fall on deaf ears Thursday lunchtime. Surely a reasonable time to find a steady stream of constituents at the polling stations  Polling stations are usually located in primary schools where, at that time, children would be playing, perhaps that old favourite, hide and seek.Read MoreSuzanne Breen: Five things to watch for when the votes are castInitial Northern Ireland election results expected at lunchtimeThere were no schoolchildren out yesterday, but, in their absence, voters in Belfast who should be there instead had certainly got the hang of hiding. Very quickly it turns into a game of spot the voter.At West Kirk Presbyterian Church on the Shankill Road, there are more election workers for the DUP and PUP than people walking past to cast their votes. \"Its quiet,\" one observes. \"Very slow\". In a -minute period between pm and .pm, only one lady strolls into the polling station.\"We have over  names on the register here. Weve had around  in so far. Thats it,\" Im told.There are, of course, expectations that the trade in the vote business will pick up later in the evening when the working day ends, but things havent got off to a promising start.Over to Cltonville Road, where the local primary school is closed for the day to serve as a polling station.Sinn Fein representatives are on the gate and again there are more of them than voters making their way along the laneway. For  minutes not one person walks past.Im about to give up when a lady finally ambles by.\"I vote every time,\" she says. \"I dont know how many people come out, but they should all be made to.\"I was brought up in a home where my mum and dad always voted. Its right to have a say.\"One or two more move past as we talk.\"Im here because the DUP say no to everything. I want to speak up for myself,\" one man tells me.For now hes a lone voice in the wilderness.As yet, theres no sign of the other main political parties. The UUP, the Alliance Party or the SDLP likely feel their resources are better deployed in other areas of the city.Maybe change is as possible, as some might say, but for now, on the streets of Belfast at least, its the politics of red, white and blue and green, white and gold that continue to dominate. Everyone  is still squeezed to the margins.At Edenbrooke Primary School off the Crumlin Road, which has a catchment electorate of over , voters for both the Oldpark and Court wards, you wouldnt say the flow was steady - to call it a trickle would be pushing it.\"I have the right to vote and I want to use it,\" says one man. \"I dont agree with much our politicians say, butI dont vote I cant complain.\"That says a lot. Voting so he has a right to complain.Its a sad indictment on our country that its got itself into such a sorry state that voters just dont seem to care. Perhapsour politicians were seen to do something meaningful, that spark of enthusiasm would reignite.In the meantime, the cure for election hangover is that old traditional hair-o-the-dog. A bit of the same to ease the pain - European Parliament elections are just around the corner, on Thursday, May .That may be more interesting to voters as the Brexit card comes back into play and some of our political big-hitters are on the canvass trail, but you suspect an overbearing sense of apathy will prevail again and the only excitement will be amongst our schoolchildren, who will be getting another day off lessons.The Electoral Office described voting yesterday as \"steady\". Turnout reports from polling stations at pm yesterday ranged from a low of % in east Belfast to as high as % in one venue in the north of the city.

Cllr Curran said space in an existing refrigeration unit is exhausted and more is required.Meanwhile, former South Down MP, Margaret Ritchie, who recently visited Ardglass, is also pleased that local fishermen can now fish in Dundalk Bay.She thanked the Minister for Fisheries and Marine in Dublin, political colleagues in Daacuteil Eacuteireann and SDLP leader Colum Eastwood for making representations to ensure legislation was enacted.She added: ldquoThis will ensure that fishing, which is the leblood of the Ardglass community, can continue unhindered. This is also good news for the local economy.Development plans for Ardglass include relocating Ardglass trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the village harbour..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Artist chosen to display work at renowned exhibition in Dublin  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK artist who is the youngest ever member of the Ulster Water Colour Society is to exhibit in Irelandrsquos biggest and most prestigious art exhibition next month.Connor Maguire has recently been selected to show his self-portrait entitled lsquoMan in the Hatrsquo at the Royal Hibernian Academy in Dublin. It will be the second time he has been chosen to exhibit along with Irelandrsquos finest artists.The  year-old mdash who is a former De La Salle High student mdash says his painting is a side profile piece which was completed in oils on canvas. Out of a total of , entries submitted to the exhibition, only  or so are successful.Connor was shortlisted last year for the Zurich Portrait prize where he was only one of  artists throughout Ireland to be up for a winning prize of two thousand euros.This gave him the opportunity to exhibit in the National Gallery of Ireland which he describes as being ldquosurreal and a dream come true.Connor said: ldquoOne of my earliest memories is of me scribbling away at a table with my grandfather, Broderick Maguire.ldquoMy grandfather, an accomplished draughtsman, carpenter, designer and painter, could do anything that he applied himself to and introduced me to pencil drawing and charcoal. He inspired and captivated me, seeing what he could accomplish with a pencil and a paintbrush. I attempted to paint as good as he did and believe Irsquom still trying.Connor continued: ldquoI recall my art teacher at high school, Mr McLaughlin, was a terric influence on me too. It was one of the few classes I actually enjoyed.ldquoAfter A-Levels, I took up art at the University of Ulster and have been painting non-stop since. I won the Chairmanrsquos Award in , and have went on to win the Stephens Award, Anna Cheyne Award and Carnathan Galleries Award.ldquoI work three days a week at the Assumption Grammar as an art technician. I work with the students, helping them explore print making and they seem to love it.Connor also works steadily as a freelance artist, specialising in painting from watercolours to oils, printmaking in the form of woodcuts, linocuts, drawings in charcoal and graphite exhibiting, and in case he might have a spare moment or two, he is a professional picture framer too.Most of Connorrsquos paintings are inspired by themes of portraiture and he has a keen eye for figure and character in familiar settings like a simple family meal. He takes inspiration form the essence of someone which he can capture through some serious study.Taking part in the exhibition, which is now in its th year, is another stepping block to Connor gaining recognition on the international stage where interest has been coming from American art curator, Didi Menendez and the RJD Gallery in New York.Both notable art critics and buyers who he has been in contact with could well result in him exhibiting further afield.Connor has also took part in BBC Radio  programmes talking about his work with broadcasting journalists, Perminder Khatkar and Helen Marks.Last year he featured on BBC rsquos lsquoThe Arts Showrsquo talking about his work with Marie Louise Muir.He says it was a ldquocool feeling to be featured alongside actor Ciaran Hynds who was featured in the same programme.Connor was shortlisted as Artist of the Year in  in association with Artists  Illustrators Magazine, exhibiting in Londonrsquos prestigious Mall Galleries alongside some of Britainrsquos greatest artists.He was also shortlisted as Artist of the Year in  with the same magazine. winning the West Dean College Award exhibiting again in the Mall Galleries in London.This RHA exhibition will catapult Connor further than he can imagine and said hersquod like to concentrate on portraiture and introduce more figures into the paintings on the theme of realism and experiment on learning new things in printmaking with woodcuts and etching.More of Connorrsquos work can be viewed on his website www.connormaguire..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Bid to boost tourism in Downpatrick area  ","story":"MORE emphasis on tourism promotion across Downpatrick and Lecale has the potential to signicantly enhance the districtrsquos economy, according to a UUP candidate in tomorrowrsquos local council election.Alexander Burgess, who is contesting one of the five seats up for grabs in the Downpatrick DEA, believes more needs to be done to make the most of the arearsquos unique link with St Patrick.Mr Burgess, who was recently joined by his party leader, Robin Swann, on a visit to the centre dedicated to Irelandrsquos patron saint in Downpatrick, is confident that furthering St Patrickrsquos links with Downpatrick and wider Lecale can help promote new business opportunities, including hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation.He is also delighted that planning permission was recently secured for a major new hotel at the site of the former Abbey Lodge development at the Belfast Road on the outskirts of the town.ldquoTourism is the districtrsquos number one economic driver and we are blessed with so many fantastic places to visit in Downpatrick and across the wider district, said Mr Burgess.ldquoMany areas would give all they had to have such an important link with St Patrick. Downpatrick boasts Irelandrsquos only centre dedicated to him but I believe more needs to be done to fully exploit the tourism potential the patron saint offers us.Mr Burgess said additional overnight accommodation in Downpatrick and Lecale was crucial to assisting any new drive to encourage more people to visit and learn about Patrick and the arearsquos rich Patrician heritage.He said having spoken to many people during his election canvass, it is clear there is simply not enough tourism accommodation at present.ldquoIt is rather ironic that while Newry, Mourne and Down Council has quite rightly put tourism at the top of its agenda, there is simply not enough accommodation for people to stay. It is an issue that needs to be addressed, continued Mr Burgess.ldquoThere are already thousands of people visiting the St Patrick Centre every year and how great it would bethere were more places for them to stay to fully exploit what the area has to offer. We already have the Ballydugan Mill hotel on the outskirts of the town and a number of bed and breakfast providers, but we need to capitalise on the lucrative overnight market by providing more bed spaces.Mr Burgess said he hopes that when day-trip tour operators arrange visits to the St Patrick Centre that they will allow additional time for tourists to visit town centre shops, cafes and restaurants..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Burgess calls for new centre to be opened  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to open Saintfieldrsquos new community centre immediately.The call has been issued by Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess, who is concerned that weeks after work on the eagerly-anticipated Belfast Road centre was completed, the entrance gates remain locked and the ultra-modern facility lies unused.On the eve of tomorrowrsquos local government election, the Recorder understands that while several opening dates were suggested, agreement could not be reached between the ious parties and that the new centre is not expected to open until the end of this month or early June at the earliest.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is scheduled to hold its annual meeting on May  and it is understood that the new centre will not open before then.A local authority spokesman said as the organisation is currently operating under the restrictions of purdah mdash imposed in the lead-up to an election and which restricts councils from making major announcements ndash the opening will not take place until after the local government poll.Cllr Burgess insists he sees no reason why the centre was not opened before now.ldquoIt is my understanding having spoken to senior council officials that all the work has been completed and it is simply a case of opening the centre. I have also been told that the centre could have opened in February. We are now in May and the entrance gates remain locked. This simply isnrsquot on, he declared.ldquoThe delay in opening a centre which the people of Saintfield helped deliver is inexcusable in my book. Over poundm has been invested in the project and while building work has been completed, the cross-community facility remains closed.Cllr Burgess said there was ample time to arrange the official opening of the centre before purdah kicked in and ahead of tomorrowrsquos election.ldquoWhen the council finally gets around to opening a centre which it has allowed to remain closed for several months, it is essential that it invites all those associated with the project, in particular, those involved with the proposal from the outset.ldquoA lot of people have invested considerable time and effort in this project and it is vital their collective efforts are recognised at the official opening.Cllr Burgess added: ldquoThe people of Saintfield and indeed further afield are perplexed as to why the centre has not opened. Perhaps after purdah ends, Newry, Mourne and Down Council will tell the districtrsquos ratepayers why there has been such an extraordinarily y and, in my opinion, totally unnecessary delay.A local authority spokesman confirmed that no date has yet been agreed for the official opening of the new community centre in Saintfield.He added: As the Council is now operating under the restrictions of lsquopurdahrsquo the centre will not open until after the local council elections have taken place..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call to begin work on Ballynahinch by pass  ","story":"CALLS have been issued for a start on work on Ballynahinchrsquos new poundm by-pass.It comes just days after major gridlock on the main approach roads to the market town over the Easter holiday period in Ballynahinch which is used as a gateway by visitors to Newcastle and the wider Mournes area in particular.Roads officials say they are keen to get on with the job of building the near two-mile by-pass linking the Belfast and Newcastle roads, with Rowallane Ulster Unionist candidate, Walter Lyons, insisting this must happen now.As part of the multi-million project, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road in Ballynahinch.Mr Lyons said the by-pass must be delivered not only to ease town centre gridlock in Ballynahinch, but to encourage new investment and attract more visitors to the area.ldquoThere is no doubt that traffic congestion in the town centre is an impediment to new retail and commercial investment in Ballynahinch and it must be so frustrating for people from Belfast and other areas who have to make their way through the town during bank and public holidays and over the summer to sit in long tailbacks, he said.Mr Lyons, who was recently joined by UUP leader Robin Swann who was visiting the town, said the campaign for the townrsquos by-pass started  years ago and that the scheme must now be delivered.ldquoMoney has been made available for other major road schemes in Northern Ireland while Ballynahinch continues to wait, he declared. ldquoThe congestion in the town centre was as bad as it has been for many years on Easter Monday and we need to address the issue.ldquoIt is clear that the congestion problem is not only impacting on investment in the town but local tourism. My fear is that people will not want to come to our districtthey are continually caught in traffic snarl-ups.Mr Lyons said log-jammed streets could also impact on the ability of the emergency services to respond to major incidents, should one arise.He added: ldquoCongestion in Ballynahinch impacts on a much wider area yet progress on delivering the much-needed by-pass is painfully slow. It is my understanding that the project cannot move to the procurement and construction stages until the necessary funding is available. This needs to happen.ldquoWe need a financial commitment to build the road to benefit the entire district. The congestion is not solely a Ballynahinch problem but,solved, has the capacity to provide major benefits. We have been told that the scheme is shovel ready so letrsquos get on with the job of building the road.Mr Lyons said thatelected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, delivering the scheme will be one of his key priorities.

Of course it helps to be spotted by the runner yoursquore looking out foryou can let him her know in advance where yoursquore going to be, provided you stick to that arrangement.We did, in relation to our positioning at the Woolwich Flyover at approx   miles.The only problem was that there was a band of bongo drummers hell bent on drowning out all our cheers.

It is the ones who are finding it hard that deserve the congratulations in my opinion and Hill and Dales provides plenty of scope for suffering.Firmus SeriesAlso on Thursday night there was a Firmus Energy Fab  Track Meet at MPT.A good turnout from EDAC juniors meant there was plenty to watch and many competed more than once.

Neil Andrews took an impressive rd place in  hour . Gavin Hynds and Niall Gibney slugged it out against the elements and were rewarded with st and th positions respectively, just a couple of minutes between them.

completing work on an environmental improvement scheme in Irish Street in Downpatrick has been branded a ldquodisgrace by a local politician.Councillor Dermot Curran has this week called for an urgent meeting to be arranged between traders and senior officials from a number of government departments involved in the project to discuss what went wrong and what can be done to ensure the project is completed as soon as possible.Last week the Recorder revealed that Irish Street traders are furious that work on the project is to take more than twice as long to complete than originally planned.Work to provide new paving, street lighting and street furniture was due to complete at the end of March, but contractors will not now be finished their work until the end of June.And, to compound tradersrsquo frustration, once contractors move off site, Irish Street will be completely closed to traffic for a short period to allow the main road to be resurfaced, taking the scheme into July.There have been a series of issues associated with the regeneration scheme with the initial start date delayed as Phoenix Gas took longer than expected to complete its work at this part of the town.Signicant issues have also arisen with the foundations for the blast wall which surrounded the former police base and problems with the sewer network.Cllr Curran wants senior representatives from Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Departments for Infrastructure and Communities to meet with traders and insists that NI Water must also be represented.ldquoThe public realm scheme has been delayed by over three months, raw sewage has been running down the street and, most shockingly, traders have not been kept abreast of the reasons for the delay, he declared.ldquoThe Irish Street project was due to complete inside three months but it will now be early July and what those responsible for the work do not realise is that businesses are being affected across the town, not just those in Irish Street.Cllr Curran said the delay in completing the scheme is having a major impact on the town centre, revealing that he has heard reports that the number of people using the Irish Street car park has reduced since work on the public realm scheme started.He said with trading conditions dficult enough at the best of times, the last thing business owners need is for the one-way system remaining in place in Irish Street for another two months.ldquoThe delay in completing this scheme is nothing short of disgraceful and questions need answered. In addition, traders should be provided with weekly progress briefings as a matter of courtesy. The fact this has not happened is deeply disappointing, Cllr Curran continued.The local politician said the temporary one-way system is impacting on traffic volumes in St Patrickrsquos Avenue and Market Street in particular, with some shoppers opting to avoid Downpatrick as work on the public realm scheme continues.Cllr Curran also suggested that the delay in delivering the public realm scheme would ldquosimply not be tolerated in any other area. He claimed that taking twice as long to complete a scheme would not be accepted in areas like Newry, Lisburn or Belfast.He declared: ldquoMany businesses in Downpatrick are suffering as the result of an unacceptable delay. The clear evenings are now here, so why canrsquot contractors be asked to work longer to complete the scheme sooner ldquoWhile I accept that the delays may be the result of unexpected circumstances, surely the trick is to come up with imaginative solutions to get the work completed as soon as possible  The suggested completion date at the end of June needs to be reassessed now.Cllr Curran said he plans to contact the ious government departments and agencies to arrange a meeting with Irish Street traders and hopes it will take place as soon as possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle park needs management strategy  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council officials have been asked to develop a management strategy for an open area at the rear of Newcastlersquos Donard Park and adjacent woodland.The request has been made by Mournes councillor Willie Clarke, who recently tabled a council motion urging the local authority to contact the Annesley Estate with a view to leasing land it owns at this part of the town.Cllr Clarke is keen for this to happen to enable the council to maintain what he described as an ldquoattractive area to complement existing amenities in Donard Park.He believes the council can help play a key role in improving the recreational, health and well-being of local people, in tandem with enhancing the resortrsquos tourism potential,the area and its important habitat are managed properly.While his recent motion was referred to the local authorityrsquos Economic Regeneration and Tourism Committee for debate, Cllr Clarke said that,re-elected, one of his key priorities will be shaping the future management of a ldquo fabulous landscape and woodland, preserving it for future generations.He continued: ldquoThe upper green area needs to be incorporated in the future management of Donard Wood, while the pathways and signage for visitors need to be improved for visitors entering the main route used by hill walkers heading into the Mournes to climb Slieve Donard.ldquoIn the short term, I have made representations to council officials to carry out maintenance improvements at the Shanslieve Drive entrance to Donard Park where visitors are greeted by rusting litter bins, council signage dating back to the s and a potholed surface.Cllr Clarke said these are improvements that need to carried out immediately.Also this week, he has called on the local authority to repaint the historic archway at the entrance to Donard Park car park.He said: ldquoRepainting the archway will also improve the appearance and aesthetics of the entrance into Donard Park and I have requested that the work is undertaken as quickly as possible, Cllr Clarke added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle rock star’s intimate solo album  ","story":"THE discovery of a random white feather gave The Answerrsquos frontman Cormac Neeson a sign of hope at the most desperate time in his le mdash and the inspiration for his first solo album.The Newcastle rocker has just released a searingly intimate and personal album called White Feather with ten tracks which deal with his eldest son Dabhoacutegrsquos fight to be born and for le itself.Launching at Belfast venue The Black Box on May , the  year-old will give his most stripped back performance as an artist as he tours with the album over the coming months.His old friends, The Unholy Gospel Band, with bass guitarist, Downpatrickrsquos own Eamon Hanlon, will be joining him for the big night.Cormac also has a new single out from the album, Broken Wing, a country-inspired track with blues backing choir that will resonate with people whether they are a parent or not.His rock vocals have given way to a deeper, introspective sound that is still etched with emotion.The  year-old singer, who once toured with rock legends AD DC, says he the experience of nearly losing his son from being born prematurely at  weeks has changed him.Dabhoacuteg, who has Downrsquos Syndrome, weighed only lb oz when he was born. After spending his first four months in a hospital neo-natal unit and undergoing heart surgery on his first birthday, he is now four. Thankfully, Dabhoacuteg has turned the corner despite overcoming serious medical obstacles in his short le.Dabhoacuteg and his  month-old brother, Conall, mean everything to Cormac and his we Louise, who now live in Belfast.ldquoWhenever you have a sick child and you go through an ordeal like that with your family, it does definitely alter your perception and you come out the other side of it changed, said Cormac.ldquoYou just look at le in a dferent way. You appreciate stuff that you never appreciated because yoursquore not sitting in an intensive care unit in the Royal [Victoria Hospital]. Anything is better than that.The couple only had a few weeks to privately celebrate getting pregnant with their first child when Louise had to be rushed into hospital.They initially were advised that pregnancy was lost as it was so early but were told to come back to hospital in a few weeks time.ldquoIt was the longest two weeks in my le, recalls Cormac. ldquoThe night before we were due to go the hospital I went out for a walk in the Mournes. I was a bit raging at the world and screaming up to the heavens asking to be give a sign that everything was going to be ok.ldquoI was literally stopped dead in my tracks with this little splash of white high in a tree. I climbed up into the tree to see what it was and it was a white feather.ldquoI had always been brought up to believe that white feathers symbolised new le. I couldnrsquot believe that I spotted it at that time and brought it back down. I had a feeling then that everything was ok. The next day we went to hospital and sure enough there was this tiny mustard seed on the scan with the most giant heartbeat you ever saw in your le. It was the beginning of what was to be a most tumultuous journey and the beginning of where we are now, having an amazing four-year-old and a baby.ldquoDabhoacuteg really is a warrior. Hersquos been through more than me and most people ever will in their lives.Long-term fans of The Answer may be surprised at one of their leaders heading to Nashville to write and record the album.But as Cormac tells it, itrsquos just the way it was meant to be.He went to the home of country music in  on a songwriting course to help write songs for other artists but ended up literally pouring his heart and pain out in the songs mdash in time-honoured country music fashion.ldquoItrsquos not a country record but you can tell it is recorded in Nashville, said Cormac.ldquoThere is an awful lot of soul to it and a bit of subtley to it as well as it allowed me to express myself in the way that I needed to at this point in my le. I needed to make a record that reflected that switch in the way I see le.The Nashville approach to writing songs was a more reflective experience for Cormac that what he is used to with bandmates Paul Mahon, Mickey Waters and James Heatley.ldquoIt was just a completely dferent approach to songwriting that I had been used to doing for  years with The Answer, said Cormac. ldquoItrsquos a hard rocking blues band and a lot of our songs are written with the volume pedal turned up rfing away, having a good time and letting songs organically develop.ldquoIn Nashville, you sit in a room with two other people and an accustic guitar and you have a long conversation about your le and what you might want to write about. I found once we were locked into the message we wanted to put across in the song everything  fell into place. We basically wrote songs in the morning and recorded in the afternoon as thatrsquos what the studio expected.ldquoA lot of what Irsquom singing about on this record just would not work on a record from The Answer because it wouldnrsquot be appropriate.

Sands struck with all the stealth and power that her dad Noel displayed for Down hurlers for many years as she beat Katie Smith all ends up with a clinical finish.Meath were now on the ropes and Sands delivered a second knock-out blow a minute later when she again ghosted in to direct a McCartan pass to the net and give down a - to - interval lead.Meath had the wind advantage after the break, but it was Down and the unrelenting McCartan who took centre stage.Two sensational points from the Castlewellan teenager, a daughter of former Down All-Ireland medal winner Greg in , stretched Downrsquos lead to seven points with only five minutes of the second half played.All credit to Meath, they steadfastly refused to throw in the towel and a Foley point left them trailing - to - after  minutes.It wax at this stage that Savage played a real captainrsquos role from her central half back role. She was simply imperious, plucking the sliotar out of the air and then sending it forward for her team-mates to chase.Meath went close to giving Down a fright in the rd minute when an explosive shot from Fagan rattled off the crossbar and was cleared to safety, but other than that, little got past Savage.McCartan and Leonard swapped points as the game drew to a close, but Down had no intention of relinquishing their grip on the game and refused to give Meath any more scores.Down: Niamh Sharkey, Orlaith OrsquoRourke, Hannah Toner, Alice Coulter, Isabella OrsquoHare, Blanaid Savage, Niamh Dempster, Megan OrsquoBoyle, Anna McKee, Cerys Clarke, Sorcha McCartan , Saoirse Sands , Gerra McGrattan, Aoibhinn Brentnall , Beth Fitzpatrick.

Last year we lted over a thousand plastic bottles, and some of them, you can tell from the labels, have been in the sea for quite a while.”She warned of the dangers of plastic pollution in the sea to wildle, adding the public can help by building litter picking into their day out.“The long term effect on marine le have not yet been determined, but we know it is negative and we know that over time those plastics are breaking down into smaller and smaller pieces of micro plastics and that is having an effect on the marine environment,” she said.“Every little bit helps to try and remove that from the bays.“This area is really important for marine le and breeding seabirds.“As the leading conservation charity, the National Trust is trying to work this into the standard annual programmes.“We carry out beach cleans on other properties, particularly around Murlough, Strangford Lough and Whitepark Bay. Rangers teams and volunteers work  days of the year on Portstewart Strand lting litter as well.“Of course the public can come along to help on those litter pick days, and also when they are visitors to special places, bringing their litter home or having their own beach clean -

And so that was good enough for me.”The -year-old amateur gardener, who is also known for voicing the Shipping Forecast, said she was hired for the job for her broadcasting, rather than gardening expertise.She said: “People pointed out about the fact that I’m not really a gardener, which I’m not. And I’ve not been appointed for my gardening expertise I’ve been appointed for my broadcasting experience.“Eric himself isn’t a great gardener, he said so himself many times.“We’re broadcasters and our job is to chair the discussion, so the point of us is to make sure the , who are so full of knowledge and expertise, that they don’t get so carried away that we don’t know what they are talking about.“We also have to make sure that everyone has a fair crack of the whip and that questions get answered.”Clugston, whose first episode of GQT airs today, said Robson’s parting advice was to “just enjoy it”.She said: “I had quite a long conversation with him and he was lovely, and very generous. He told me I could ask him anything, anytime, I could ring him.“He told me really just to enjoy it. We talked a lot about the  and he said, ‘You know they are amazing’, which I know, as a listener, but of course having met them, they are incredible and he said trust the , they know what they are doing, your job is just to kind of keep the flow going and keep a sense of fun about it. So that’s what I’m trying to do.”The newsreader, who has anosmia, which means she has no sense of smell, said the format of GQT will also remain the same.IRA victim’s son asks Sinn Fein MP: Why won’t

Dogs and their human companions are being invited to Dogs Trust Ballymenas Family Fun Day at the Ballee Playing Fields on May .All proceeds from the day will go towards the continued care of residents at the Rehoming Centre, located outside the town at Teeshan.This year’s event will also mark the first ‘Doggy Olympics’ which will be held by Dogs Trust’s Dog School team in Northern Ireland. This will include an Olympic Dash course which has fun challenges for owners and their dogs to complete such as the loose lead egg and spoon race, with prizes up for grabs.

There will be Canine Carers on hand to offer rehoming advice, free microchipping and a Dogs Trust Reunion.Dogs Trust Ballymena Supporter Relations Officer Samuel Reid said: “Everything we do is for our rescue dogs and we hope you and your four-legged friends can join us on the day and show your support. We can promise you a really fun day out for all the family, with lots of activities available throughout the day.“It’s a fantastic opportunity to meet local dog lovers and raise pounds for the hounds in our care as the proceeds from the day help us to care for dogs like five-year-old Lurcher cross Banjo , currently staying at the Rehoming Centre.”Banjo is a sweet-natured dog who loves attention, as well as walks in quiet areas and will do anything for a tasty treat. He would prefer to be the only dog in the house and could live with older children.”Entry is £ per adult and children are free but encouraged to donate one tin of dog food.

Three years on, operators Penarth Quays Marina and Vale owners have not agreed on a way to bring it back into operation. Gwynne Grfiths, chairman of the association, said: ldquoLoss of this amenity is particularly hard for those without access to a car who rely on public transport.ldquoThere is nothing mechanically wrong with the bridge. It was tested on February .ldquoThere appears to be disagreement between Penarth Quays and the Vale over the safety facilities needed to operate the bridge and minimise the impact on neighbouring houses and businesses.The Association is now campaigning for it to be reopened.A spokesperson for Penarth Quays Marina said: ldquoWe are obligated to operate the bridge based on an agreement made in , but the bridge was built to standards applicable in . Now, the bridge has several operational regulations like alarm levels ndash we canrsquot balance the high level of noise needed for a bridge and the low level needed for a residential area. This is the reality that the council have to consider and resolve.A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesman said: ldquoThe swing bridge is maintained and operated by Quay Marinas, who manage the Penarth Quays Marina site.ldquoIt was closed due to a number of safety concerns, with upgrades needed before it can be reopened, including audible warnings.ldquoThe council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report following which our health and safety officers and those from Quay Marinas will discuss possible solutions which may enable the bridge to be reopened in the future. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The works have been unveiled in a year in which the hospice is due to celebrate its th year.Sarah Lloyd-Davies, hospice manager, said: ldquoWe are so grateful to the Hodge Foundation for once again supporting vital work to not only allow us to continue to provide expert end of le care and support to people living with a terminal illness, and their families, but also to help us expand our reach to the community in Penarth.ldquoWe want people to understand more about the work we do here, and are excited to open our cafeacute doors and encourage people to come in and have conversations with us about end of le care.ldquoThank you also to the estate of Mrs Seaward for allowing us to create two relaxing and calming Spa bathrooms for patients, which help elevate the service we can provide at the hospice.Volunteer Ian Spence, who has been volunteering on reception for  years, is now also spending some hours helping in the cafeacute.He said: ldquoIt makes me feel good about myself. I get to give something back to the community, or rather put something into it.ldquoThe hospice is such a warm place to come to and the staff are all fantastic at making everyone feel welcome.Suzanne, who has previously visited the hospice with brother and Olympian Colin Jackson, said: ldquoItrsquos been a pleasure to officially open the new Marie Curie Cafeacute at the charityrsquos Cardf and the Vale Hospice in Penarth.ldquoMeeting the staff, volunteers and families and hearing stories about the care provided here for people living with a terminal illness has been inspiring.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

Regardless of how you voted in the referendum, whether wersquore in or out we should all be proud of what we produce on this island and Irsquom here to show you that itrsquos possible to create a great product without having to go to the Far East.ldquoIt has taken me three years to develop the ZIGZAG - from the seed of an idea to the living and breathing product you can see today. I want you to support our crowdfunding campaign so we can give a boost to the factories in Wales which have supported our development. Theyrsquore ready to make your ZIGZAG now!Factory boss, Jason Keetch, who runs the factory making the ZIGZAG, said: \"It has been an absolute pleasure working on the ZIGZAG with John.The majority of our workload consists of manufacturing sub components for larger designs so we rarely get to make a recognisably finished product like this. Seeing first hand the progression of the design and working so closely with John on it has made this project feel extra special.ldquoMy whole team are proud that the ZIGZAG is a fully Welsh product and that we have been a part of its story.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Ulster Business GMcG is already a well-established and leading independent accountancy and advisory business, and the growing firm tells Ulster Business about planning for a brighter future, carrying out major investment and developing the next generation “Our success is about people, building and growing relationships, innovation and developing the next generation. We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

The struggling chain has entered into a company voluntary arrangement . It follows a pre-pack administration for the high street business. Five Northern Ireland Debenhams stores are continuing to trade, but it has confirmed  other stores will shut, outside Northern Ireland. It’s thought more than , jobs could be at risk. Debenhams is the anchor tenant at five shopping centres in Northern Ireland, including Newry’s Quays Shopping Centre, Ballymena’s Fairhill, Belfast’s CastleCourt, Craigavon’s Rushmere and Londonderry’s Foyleside. The firm’s earlier administration angered shareholder Mike Ashley, owner of Sports Direct, who has called for the process to be reversed. The administration wipes out the stakes held by Sports Direct and all other shareholders. The stores that are due to close are: Altrincham, Ashford, Birmingham Fort, Canterbury, Chatham, Eastbourne, Folkestone, Great Yarmouth, Guildford, Kirkcaldy, Orpington, Slough, Southport, Southsea, Staines, Stockton, Walton, Wandsworth, Welwyn Garden City, Wimbledon, Witney, Wolverhampton. Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, director Aodhán Connolly, says \"rising costs, a sluggish economy, and changing shopping habits are making le incredibly hard for the industry\". \"Those pressures are being exacerbated by ever-increasing public policy costs which are making it more expensive to employ workers and operate from physical premises. These factors will lead to a very dferent retail industry over the next few years. \"The challenges department stores face are a microcosm of the immense changes affecting the retail industry. As more consumers shop on-line, there is a challenge to encourage shoppers into stores, and then to get them to spend when they are there. One of the big trends we are seeing is retailers innovating to try and create a number of reasons for customers to visit the store. That can be through offering food and drink, dferent services, and by investing in customer service. The big advantage a physical retailer has is those trained helpful colleagues who can provide detailed guidance on products to help customers. \"It’s notable those retailers who have invested in evolving from purely physical retail to a multi-channel offering are those who are in the strongest position. Many of the larger stores are particularly affected by government policy which has consistently made operating from property more expensive. With margins so tight, that tax burden is making le dficult for high street retailers.\"View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Email-640x315.jpg","title":"it firm pinnacle hosting event at kingspan stadium","story":"Posted on Tuesday  April  by Ulster Business A leading IT firm will host an event at the home of Ulster Rugby at an event to help educate and inform businesses.

Corporate lending to Danske Bank customers fell by % during the first quarter of the year as Brexit uncertainty meant customers put off investment, chief executive Kevin Kingston said. Profit before loan impairments was up % to £.m. But corporate lending was down, Mr Kingston said, \"with the heightened uncertainty around Brexit during quarter one persuading some our larger customers to delay planned investments until later in the year\". But overall business banking lending, of which corporate lending is part, had increased by %, mainly to existing customers. The chief executive said many business banking clients had been pursuing growth plans, but that others were extending their borrowing to prepare themselves \"for any economic challenges that could be associated with the Brexit process\".
