The Queen, Charles and William all watched it go live at 6.30pm. Immediately, the phones began to ring in London, Sandringham and Charles\u0027s Scottish seat of Birkhall. Senior members of royal household staff, on their way home to their families, turned round and raced back to their offices.One described being forced to take part in two simultaneous conference calls, with a phone on each ear.At 8.13pm a statement was released by Buckingham Palace – bypassing Harry and Meghan\u0027s office, in a sign of the Queen\u0027s displeasure – which tersely acknowledged what they had done but stressed that these were \u0027complicated issues\u0027 that still needed to be \u0027worked through\u0027.The message was clear.

This is where your body is struggling to deal with blood sugar levels, and it is a very clear sign that you are about to develop full-blown type 2 diabetes.I didn’t have any symptoms of diabetes (such as excessive thirst or blurred vision), but my blood sugar levels were far too high.My GP put me on metformin tablets and drugs to control my blood pressure. I was also probably advised to lose a bit of weight. But even then I didn’t listen. It was only when I first met Roy that I finally took notice.         Tucking in: Dave in 2009, eating fish and chips, before he started the diet plan. He said losing weight had reversed his slide into diabetesWe met eight years ago when he was invited to join our TV series as an expert. He took one look at me and my co‑Hairy Biker Simon King and said: ‘You’re both morbidly obese.’It was great TV and the impetus we needed to launch the series in 2012.But what the viewers never got to see was the behind-the-scenes support he gave me. He made it clear that I was looking down the barrel of a gun, and diabetes was one disease I seriously needed to avoid at any cost.Then, off camera one day, he quietly took me aside and told me if I lost weight I could reverse the pre-diabetic state, get off the drugs and effectively protect myself against getting full-blown diabetes.         Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby with The Hairy Bikers Dave Myers and Simon King on December 3I was shocked, but intrigued.This was pretty revolutionary news at the time and it was something I was keen to try.From that point on I worshipped at the altar of Professor Taylor. It wasn’t always easy, particularly when you’re working with Michelin-starred chefs asking you to taste their exquisite mashed potato which basically wipes out your entire daily calorie allowance in one mouthful.Luckily the weight dropped off pretty fast, and within three months I’d shifted more than 3 st (from 114 kg to 95 kg) and Si’s weight dropped by nearly 4 st.         Hairy Biker Dave Myers has undergone a dramatic weight transformation. He said one of his key pieces of advice from Professor Roy is to aim to stay as close as you can to the weight you were when you were 21We felt great, but I noticed the impact first on my blood pressure, which was falling so low I’d end up feeling dizzy when exercising.Just two months into the experiment, Roy advised me to stop taking my diabetes tablets and to come off my blood pressure pills because I’d clearly lost enough weight that my organs were beginning to function normally again. That was a real thrill.Roy’s diagnosis was confirmed at a check-up six months after I started losing weight, when tests showed my blood sugar levels were smack‑bang in the normal category. Just as Roy predicted, losing weight had reversed my slide into diabetes.I’ve worked hard to maintain that weight loss and I’ve had my blood sugar levels tested every six months for the past seven years and the results have remained normal.One of Roy’s most important pieces of advice is that if you want to avoid diabetes, you should aim to stay as close as you can to the weight you were when you were 21.Sadly, I never did get back to the 34 in waist of my youth. But I managed a 36 in waist . . . which wasn’t bad from a starting point of 49 in.I’m still in contact with Roy and he says I could improve my health even further if I lose another 2 st.I might have laughed at the idea a few years ago, but I’m 62 now so I might make a concerted effort to shift that extra weight this spring.        "},{"url":null,"title":"Racism drove Meghan Markle Britain say prominent black Britons","story":"Share this article The Huffington Post published an article headlined ‘Why Black People Think Racism Drove Meghan And Harry To Quit The Royal Family’, while in The New York Times, Afua Hirsch, an author on race, said Meghan’s treatment showed that however successful you are in Britain ‘racism will follow you’.But Trevor Phillips, former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said it was ‘nonsense’ to suggest the couple were leaving ‘because of racism’.

He feared she\u0027d allow herself to be seduced by fellow cast member John Leyton, who\u0027d had a No 1 hit in 1961 with Johnny Remember Me.Sellers phoned Britt long- distance from Hollywood: \u0027Why don\u0027t you take the day off and come over?\u0027 He assured her he\u0027d clear all this with her producers, he was well connected — and he\u0027d worked twice with Batasi\u0027s director, John Guillermin, on the feature films Never Let Go and Waltz Of The Toreadors.This was bluster. Sellers said nothing to any producer, and Britt later felt she\u0027d been more or less abducted: \u0027He made sure I didn\u0027t go back.\u0027 Her role was re-shot with Mia Farrow. The litigation lasted years, Sellers countersuing 20th Century Fox for \u0027mental distress and injury to his health\u0027.         The couple pictured together in 1965. The compliant, cosy, deferential scene was undermined somewhat by Sellers\u0027s feelings of morbid jealousy — and by the couple\u0027s instant separationMeanwhile, to make himself extra-virile in bed, Sellers, aged not quite 40, was taking ampoules of amyl nitrate, or poppers, which disrupted his metabolism — and on April 7, 1964, he suffered a series of heart attacks.Billy Wilder, who had not hit it off with his star, commented: \u0027Heart attack? Heart attack? You\u0027ve got to have a heart before you can have an attack!\u0027 Sellers was replaced by American actor Ray Walston, the footage all re-done, and Kiss Me, Stupid was a huge flop.Back at Elstead, it was Britt\u0027s job to see Sellers through his convalescence, and to administer his complex cardiological medication.He was an ungrateful invalid. When he found out Britt was pregnant, Sellers said: \u0027I\u0027ve got Michael, I\u0027ve got Sarah. I don\u0027t want any more children.\u0027 Director Bryan Forbes and Nanette Newman, his actress wife, had to talk him out of insisting Britt had an abortion.When she went into labour with Victoria in January 1965, he dumped her on the pavement outside the Welbeck Street Clinic and whizzed off to make What\u0027s New Pussycat. When Britt eventually visited him on the set, she blotted her copybook by mistaking Sellers for Woody Allen — there was a physical similarity, which Sellers found irksome.When he was again mistaken for Woody, by a Hollywood mogul during the making of Casino Royale in 1967, he was next heard from in Sweden. Sellers had gone into hiding with Britt\u0027s parents and refused to return to the film.Sellers was incredibly mischievous in his off-screen life, too.At Elstead, where Britt was sometimes so bored that she\u0027d spend an evening gazing at her reflection in the polished marble of the fireplace, the pair would dine on frozen cottage pie and fish fingers, served by a butler.When Goons fan Prince Charles came to lunch, Sellers hadn\u0027t made provision for his bodyguards, and told the cook to ide His Royal Highness\u0027s portion among his entourage — Charles was surprised to receive an eyeful of food. \u0027Sheer insanity,\u0027 said Spike Milligan.Sellers and Britt made home movies with Lord Snowdon and Princess Margaret — and Sellers asked Snowdon if he\u0027d like to swap wives. Sellers had to settle for a new camera lens instead, and Snowdon got a speedboat in return.Sellers also asked Bryan Forbes if Nanette could be exchanged for Britt, but Forbes managed to laugh off the suggestion.That such a crazy scheme could be broached indicates all was not well. \u0027Being with Peter was like riding on a rollercoaster,\u0027 remembered Britt. \u0027One minute you were flying high, the next you were running low.\u0027Nothing came lower than his doomed efforts to turn her into his one big impossible love, Italian film star Sophia Loren.In 1967, Sellers and Britt went to Rome to make The Bobo, in which he was a singing matador and she was to be a seductress. He insisted she wear a black wig, like Loren\u0027s. This was ridiculous but he couldn\u0027t see it.\u0027You\u0027re a lousy bloody actress,\u0027 he told her. \u0027Why don\u0027t you listen to what I tell you?\u0027 Not exactly morale-boosting comments — which began to be backed up with violence.He stamped on Britt\u0027s wedding ring so often that Garrard, the Queen\u0027s jewellers, got used to having to fix it. He threatened her with a shotgun, ripped up her clothes, smashed her cassette player and carefully took apart her Cartier watch, flushing the cogs down the lavatory.He also chucked her out of hotels — and when her parents came from Stockholm to rescue her after a flare-up on the island of Ischia, he didn\u0027t like to hear them babbling in Swedish, as he felt excluded.Sellers threw her luggage off his yacht, and Bert Mortimer was for ever having to gather up her personal effects. \u0027Our marriage is finished!\u0027 Sellers would cry.Britt fought back, once bashing him over the head with a picture frame. \u0027You hit me with me mum,\u0027 he said, when he saw the cherished photo of Peg on the floor.They were orced in 1968, Britt citing Sellers\u0027s psychological cruelty. He carried on getting married and orced, treating women like cars or cameras, accessories he could replace without compunction when he was fed up.For all his craziness, however, there has not been a comic actor to touch him.From the The Goon Show to Ealing classics, Boulting Brothers films, work with Stanley Kubrick, Inspector Clouseau, all the way to Being There, Sellers remains a comic genius and it doesn\u0027t much matter any more that he was a mean-spirited egomaniac.As for Britt, she became a Bond girl, and starred in Get Carter and The Wicker Man. In Scandal, she is to be glimpsed on a sofa, with tassels on her nipples.She had a long relationship with Rod Stewart and a shorter one with Warren Beatty. In 1996, she auctioned off her memorabilia at Christie\u0027s — including the wedding dress from her marriage to Sellers and the come-hither Polaroids he took on the night they met.\u0027I wanted to get rid of it all,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027m so tired of that sexy, cute little sex kitten, the youthful Britt.\u0027 I can sympathise with that.ROGER LEWIS\u0027S book The Life And Death Of Peter Sellers was made into a Golden Globe and Emmy award-winning film by HBO, where Sellers is played by Geoffrey Rush and Britt Ekland by Charlize Theron."},{"url":null,"title":"Meghan Markle signs voiceover deal Disney return donation elephant charity","story":"Share this article The royal couple met with representatives from organisations doing ground-breaking work in the areas of conservation and the environment.Prince Harry has taken a keen interest in African conservation projects over the years and in 2017 he became the president of African Parks. Harry and Meghan: Voiceover deal with Disney hints at future career path | News | The Times"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/01/11/01/23259838-0-image-m-38_1578706234569.jpg","title":"Naturists slam leisure centre banning childrens play area built view pool","story":"Share this article He said: \u0027While the new centre has been built for the past two years we\u0027ve asked what will happen to us and not received an answer — so they\u0027ve been happily taking our money then kicked us out with no warning.\u0027It really is an old fashioned attitude — being naked is not a big deal and swimming in the nude is very enjoyable.\u0027Julian, who did not give his second name, was joined in his complaint by former mayor of Alton Dean-Paul Phillips who did not see a problem with the sessions.

She is very good at it. Everyone involved with her initiative at Smart Works, a small charity that helps disadvantaged women get into the workplace, was immensely impressed by her input. Her contribution went well beyond making a token appearance and showing an interest. She came up with the idea of designing and selling product to raise funds and profile and gave an inspiring speech without notes at the launch.This is a woman who knows what she can achieve and what she is worth. As Meghan Markle, B-list actress in a successful TV series, that calculation was relatively straightforward.         One of the aspects of Royal life Meghan will have found most difficult is not being allowed to voice an opinion, writes ALEXANDRA SHULMAN (Meghan during her and Harry\u0027s secret visit to the Hubb Community Kitchen in west London)For Harry, as Duke of Sussex and sixth in line to the British throne, there was similar clarity. But as second-tier Royals roaming the world on the speaker circuit, making red-carpet appearances, endorsing products and occasionally appearing on the balcony at Buckingham Palace, the rules of engagement become very murky. Right now the Sussexes are hot.Meghan is beautiful and impassioned. Harry still dashing and a frontline Royal. Things change. In the world of celebrity, you are always having to watch out for the new kid on the block. Fame is a greedy beast that has to be continually fed.Until now, their working life of Royal tours, walkabouts, visiting disaster zones and being guests of honour at charity events has automatically fuelled and burnished their profile. But without the very special imprimatur of first-tier Royalty, the kind of power and influence they currently enjoy may not survive in the long term – especially if they are cashing them in to gain financial independence.The celebrity circuit is complex and quite brutal. If you become known as an easy gun for hire to the highest bidder, in a short time your currency drops. You can spend a few years giving hugely lucrative speeches for international hedge-fund dinners, and being on the advisory board of a bioersity start-up in Qatar, but to give this existence longevity you have to keep replenishing your worth – whether that is in the degree of your fame or in exceptional talent or knowledge.         Meghan is beautiful and impassioned. Harry still dashing and a frontline Royal, writes ALEXANDRA SHULMAN (Meghan and Harry during their secret visit to the Hubb Community Kitchen in west London)Unanchored celebrity has a built-in obsolescence. It’s hard to understand why they are swapping a profile that confers automatic and eternal worldwide fame for one where your worth will be in part measured by your number of Instagram followers and dependent on the skill of your marketing team.This kind of celebrity is also reliant on exposure, and not simply the exposure that you selectively chose to put out on your own social media sites. The relentless commentary of media of every kind is part of the deal and, if anything, the Sussexes may well be less protected in this new world than they felt in their old. Every move they make will be analysed and scrutinised and if they are being paid handsomely for it, they will no doubt be regarded as fair game.This weekend Meghan is back in Canada with her son while Harry is at home hammering out the details of their future. I hope he has some time out and manages to catch up with old friends.The couple are no doubt exhilarated by having made the decision to cut loose and get their plans out in the open. Almost certainly, they will be looking at the future and see it glittering with opportunity. Which it could be. If they don’t take their position for granted.But if they are hoping to build a new life that trades on royalty without fulfilling the more difficult obligations that come with it, which is reliant on the toxic mirage of fame without worth, not that many years down the line they could be looking at a very different picture."},{"url":null,"title":"The northern Tory women queue promotion","story":"Share this article Women’s Minister Victoria Atkins, the MP for Louth and Horncastle in Lincolnshire, is also tipped for promotion in the imminent reshuffle.The PM’s inner circle, including director of communications Lee Cain and lead Brexit negotiator David Frost, spent eight hours discussing what one source called ‘a mixture of big picture strategic and political thinking and the nuts and bolts of teams and personnel’.Ms Mirza will this week send a letter to each Cabinet Minister containing instructions about the policy areas they should prioritise over the coming year.At Chequers, the group discussed the Government’s strategy for the Brexit trade talks and key domestic policies, centred on funding injections for NHS, new law-and-order reforms – including how to recruit the 20,000 extra police promised during the Election campaign – and the roll-out of a new Australian-style points-based immigration system.After a slow start to the year, with Mr Johnson accused of being a ‘submarine’ Prime Minister after refusing to break his Caribbean holiday to deal with the Iran crisis, No 10 sources say they planning to ‘crank up the pace of delivery’ on the policies set out in the party’s manifesto.          Women’s Minister Victoria Atkins, the MP for Louth and Horncastle in Lincolnshire, is also tipped for promotion in the imminent reshuffleBut senior government sources say that Mr Johnson intends to be more of a ‘hands-off’ premier who will allow Ministers to lead the responses to future crises.

Boris wants departments to develop their expertise and enjoy autonomy.’A No 10 insider added: ‘The Prime Minister will be focused on his core issues – Brexit, law and order and the NHS. Last week was deliberate and you will see him more and more as the chairman of the board.’ The source pointed to ‘a return to Cabinet government in the more traditional sense, with Ministers more accountable for the decisions they are taking. It makes for a good government.’Despite the Iran crisis being fronted by Mr Wallace and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, Mr Johnson gave ‘clear and very forthright instructions about the direction of travel’, according to one Cabinet Minister.         Treasury Chief Secretary Rishi Sunak is among those tipped for advancement in the reshuffle – expected to be announced after Brexit Day at the end of this monthThe Mail on Sunday has learned that Mr Johnson opened a meeting of his top-secret National Security Council on Tuesday afternoon by setting out his foreign policy views on the United States.A source said: ‘He was very clear – we want to be good allies with the US but we are not going to be dragged along by them on everything or sucked into conflicts.’ Another Cabinet source described Mr Johnson’s outlook as ‘more Wilson than Blair’ – a reference to Labour PM Harold Wilson, who kept Britain out of the war in Vietnam, rather than Tony Blair, who led us into conflict in Iraq.Under the new female taskforce, female staff in Downing Street will meet regularly with the women MPs to advise them on how to climb the ministerial ranks.A source said: ‘Many of these brilliant MPs did not expect to win and we have a duty of care to make sure they succeed in Westminster. We are going to be in government for at least half of the 2020s, and have a unique opportunity to change the party and Britain for good.’The poster girl for Mr Johnson’s assault on Labour’s Northern heartlands, Ms Davison told The Mail on Sunday during the Election campaign that she was just 13 when she learned her father Dominic had been killed by a single blow to the head in a pub. Ms Davison, who was on her third bid to enter the Commons, won Bishop Auckland with a majority of nearly 8,000 votes.A former contestant on the Channel 4 show Bride And Prejudice with her fiance – 35 years her senior – she received support on the campaign trail from Mr Johnson’s girlfriend Carrie Symonds, and admitted that the ‘poster girl thing’ was probably due to her tragic family story and her ‘slightly unusual demographics’. Last night a No10 source said: ‘The PM is committed to getting more women MPs in total, and promoting the Tory women who are already on the green benches.‘His first Downing Street reception of the year was for Tory women MPs and female advisers.‘This sits alongside his work on girls’ education, which will continue as a major personal priority.’Mr Johnson’s No 10 team have also been canvassing opinions on how to mark Brexit, which will take place at 11pm on January 31.One option that was considered – extending the licensing hours into February 1 – has now been ruled out. A source said: ‘We thought that it would allow Brexiteers to celebrate and Remainers to drown their sorrows, but we have now decided against it.’   Could Michael Gove become CEO of Government? Boris Johnson\u0027s plan to become a \u0027chairman of the board\u0027 Prime Minister clears the way for the former leadership contender ByHarry Coleand Glen Owen for The Mail on Sunday Boris Johnson’s plan to become a ‘chairman of the board’ Prime Minister – leaving to others the hard graft of running his administration – clears the way for Michael Gove to become the Government’s effective chief executive.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is being viewed with suspicion by colleagues, who believe that he is ‘on manoeuvres’ to secure an expanded Whitehall fiefdom through the forthcoming reshuffle.The ambitious former leadership contender – who torpedoed Mr Johnson’s 2016 bid for the Tory crown – has ‘used his extensive involvement in the planning for a No-Deal Brexit to extend his tentacles throughout Whitehall’, according to one source.           Before Mr Johnson won his Brexit deal, Mr Gove chaired the daily XO committee in Whitehall, which developed contingency plans for a No-Deal Brexit. It gave him the power to give orders to any department which needed to be ready for the worst-case scenarios‘He wants to play a key part in all the trade talks and hopes to lead the UK’s preparations for the UN climate change summit in Glasgow later this year.‘He even wants to be pivotal to Boris’s levelling up agenda’.After winning his 80-seat majority in December, Mr Johnson said he wanted to ‘level up’ by raising economic performance across all parts of the country.           The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is being viewed with suspicion by colleagues, who believe that he is ‘on manoeuvres’ to secure an expanded Whitehall fiefdom through the forthcoming reshuffleA Cabinet Minister told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Michael seems to want to use his No Deal planning experience to run the country for ever. He’s a bit of a Cabinet cowboy, riding over everyone else’s patch.’The Minister added that Mr Johnson’s chief Brexit negotiator David Frost had ‘bristled’ at the idea that Mr Gove would have ‘oversight’ of his work. November’s Glasgow climate change summit, known as COP26, is designed to produce an international response to the climate emergency.Before Mr Johnson won his Brexit deal, Mr Gove chaired the daily XO committee in Whitehall, which developed contingency plans for a No-Deal Brexit. It gave him the power to give orders to any department which needed to be ready for the worst-case scenarios.A source said: ‘Boris’s desire to be a hands-off PM, as he showed by staying on the beach while Iraq was in flames, is the perfect opportunity for a workaholic control freak like Michael. It means he can get his hands on everything from the trade talks – both with the EU and the White House – to the UN’s climate change agenda.‘Michael and Boris have always had this strange psychodrama, dating back to the time he knifed Boris, but now he is on the brink of effectively being CEO for his old foe’.Mr Gove’s expected elevation means he will be vying with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab for the bragging rights of being Mr Johnson’s No 2.

But, as this riveting first UK show reveals, his radiant, humane paintings set him apartThe Italian painter Tullio Crali ought not to be quite such a head-on revelation. After all, his astonishing vision of a solo pilot nose-ing straight into a canyon of skyscrapers, light shattering round his helmeted head, is one of the great masterpieces of futurist art. Yet this riveting survey at the Estorick Collection comes as a surprise from first to last, and not only because it is his first in Britain.Crali (1910-2000) is a strange case, in life as in art. He grew up in Zadar, on what is now the Croatian coast, but which once belonged to Italy. His family moved to north-eastern Italy in 1922, and it was there, at the age of 15, that he created his first futurist work after reading an article about the movement.Crali fell hard for the futurist manifesto, with its addiction to motion, speed, modernity and roaring machinery – from the espresso maker to the Gatling gun, the aeroplane to the hurtling motorcar, notoriously described by Marinetti, futurist leader, as “more beautiful than the victory of Samothrace”.But Crali’s own painting of a car rushing round a bend is more sophisticated than anything by his contemporaries. The vehicle itself is long gone, leaving only the hint of a wheel among magnificent curving vectors of black, cream and red – scintillating traces of its fast departure.And though he was as committed as his colleagues to the plane as ultimate futurist symbol, Crali’s aeropittura, as they are called, are frequently more original. A terrific painting at the start of this show, called Tricolour Wings (1932), has the plane ascending in sudden stages, scattering its target markings up through the sky like urgent thought bubbles. The plane’s geometry, repeated as if in stop-start motion, perfectly describes the sharp sensation of sudden uplift, catching at each new thermal current. And the sky around it – running all the way from hyperreal clouds to gracious, Titianesque beauty – amounts to a painted collage.Indeed, though you could never mistake him for anything else, Crali often seems the odd man out of the futurist gang. For one thing, he is a tremendous colourist. Planes rise into moonlight-blue skies or descend through lavender mists. The scarlet stripes of a biplane burn like a cigarette among pearl-grey clouds. And in a work such as Broken Engine, the polished wood of the slowing propeller shines gold against smoke and slate-blue heavens, its deco sheen ineffably glorified.What is more, there is an undeniably human aspect to Crali’s art. People get into the picture. There are two vast seamen at the prow of a gigantic battleship, trying to steer the ship through a storm with their muckle hands. A female figure raises her shapely arms like elegant wings and the blue air around her vibrates. He can paint the most complicated machinery – steam-driven pistons in a shipyard, or high-rising cranes – and there will be an intimation of human beings moving about below.Crali himself kept on moving. He left Italy after the second world war for an art school in Paris, remaining there for almost a decade. His drawings of the city describe the brasseries, stairwells and metal chairs of the Jardin du Luxembourg, the shadows along the Seine embankment: Paris, in his words, as “mysterious, deep and moody”. In the 60s he quit Paris for Cairo, then back to Italy, eventually ending up in Milan.But somehow Crali’s art stands still, as the man does not. In the late 1980s he is still painting aeroplanes as if they were brand new inventions, still showing solo pilots swooping about in glass cockpits. It is as if the international space race never happened.And his devotion to futurism never seems to waver, even though Marinetti died in 1944 and the movement had its final meeting in 1950. It is hard to decipher Crali’s own politics from anything he wrote or painted the curators of this show emphasise his belief in futurism as an aesthetic rather than political ideology. But the association with Mussolini’s fascism can hardly be ignored.So perhaps that is why his later career lies in shadow. The Estorick is showing a number of Crali’s Sassintesi – startling collages of stones, seaweed and assorted bric-a-brac found on beaches and presented upright, on canvases. These appear entirely novel. And every now and again they hit the mark, when Crali takes some sea-carved rock and twists it out of kilter, so that it suddenly looks like a rushing futurist figure.But he is at his best when most liberated from the movement. One of the most beautiful works in this show is a landscape of Ostia in late evening sun, as the shadows of hill and vale deepen, and rays of dying light arch between earth and sky. Translucent green patches stand for trees and clouds, and everything meets at the vanishing point of the ocean, radiant and serene – perhaps the most beautiful scene Crali ever painted.• Tullio Crali: A Futurist Life is at the Estorick Collection, London, from 15 January until 11 April "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02677e51b04044604b24b17b8c5bcbe016b95653/0_160_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=254799f2b8af7f3f954b6d45bac8af4f","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"The Iran plane crash, bushfires in Australia and the continuing unrest in Hong Kong and Santiago – the best photography in news, culture and sport from around the world this week"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d150e93c6051fd3e726e2d6554e5fa308095e5d/0_819_2397_1438/master/2397.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=370fd822bc3733907665c2c03c3713ab","title":"elizabeth wurtzel my chats with prozac nation author nosheen iqbal","story":"Pop culture loves the hot mess: a female character – real or otherwise – hurtling from one improbable drama to the next. She is gregarious and overshares, she is narcissistic but magnetic. She has become a familiar trope in film and television, trolleying around with fag ash, drink spilling, hem riding up, and is almost always white.It’s difficult to fathom then, that when Elizabeth Wurtzel published Prozac Nation in 1994, all this – women being unashamedly improper and full of irrepressible feeling – was still relatively uncharted, eyebrow-raising territory.Wurtzel became famous by making a career from her emotions. “All I ever wanted to be was good,” she wrote, in her second memoir More, Now, Again in 2002. “And it’s all turned out so bad.”It was a sad and cruel shock to learn last week that she had died of cancer at just 52, when she was still processing the impact of the illness on her life and writing a sequel to the book that made her a sensation at 27.At 21, Wurtzel was one of the first patients to be prescribed Prozac and wrote in comical, luminescent prose about her multiple chemical dependencies – prescription or otherwise. She detailed the dark drag of depression that had engulfed her at the age of 10, prompted her first overdose at 11 and had her self-harming at 12.Twenty-five years after she appalled and delighted critics, it can’t be overstated that the writers writing candidly about their mental health today owe a lot to Wurtzel’s disarming frankness. She shifted the dial on what young women writers were able to write, say and confess to, helping usher in what Slate magazine called “the first-person industrial complex”.“Boys are one interest of mine that never really goes away, though to little avail,” she wrote in her first memoir. “None of the guys I go to school with notice me. I’m not even on their lists of alternatives after all the girls with names like Jennifer and Alison and Nicole don’t work out.”But Wurtzel grew up beautiful and brainy there was no shortage of men, love, sex and adventure for her to write about, often in graphic, navel-gazing detail.In many ways, although entirely a product of Generation X, Wurtzel formed a template for all the caricatures that have been drawn for millennials: self-absorbed and hypersensitive. Yet, of course, she was intensely talented and clever it didn’t preclude her from being a self-confessed nightmare at times – it was part of the legend of her life force. A book review in The New York Times famously described her as “Sylvia Plath with the ego of Madonna”, a line she delighted in and used as her Twitter bio. As she herself put it, Wurtzel was “early for history”.Bookshops now groan under a mass of titles celebrating difficult women, reappraising lost feminist heroes or patronising readers with inane titles that insist YOU GOT THIS or GO GIRLBOSS.Wurtzel didn’t necessarily invent the form – she remained unimpressed by a publishing phenomenon that now stretches beyond parody – but by publishing The Bitch Rules in 2000 (witty and caustic missives and essays she subtitled “common sense advice for an uncommon life”) she certainly foresaw it.Growing up, I found Wurtzel irresistible. She – like me! – was a misfit. She thought too much and felt too much and – like me! – became a music journalist, confident that she could hold her own against the chin-stroking, plaid-shirted manboys that dominated the cultural discourse and dictated what did and didn’t constitute good taste.I began what became a longstanding correspondence with Wurtzel in 2013, after she had attended Yale and retrained as a lawyer. I was keen to coax her back into writing, namely profiles for the , and there was an author I wanted her to meet. “I really am not practicing law full time at all,” she wrote in September of that year. “I mostly am writing, quite honestly. My boss lets me pretend to be a lawyer, which is nice of him.”Wurtzel blew deadlines and was prone to drama, but she would always write with long, thoughtful paragraphs of whatever was on her mind, initially signing off “typos by iPhone” and later, after sending me a withering takedown of Hillary Clinton, “sent by my feminist iPhone”.We managed to work on two pieces together in the end, one on her obsession with the TV show The Good Wife and another on her enduring love for Bob Dylan. But neither was really about all the things that made her long, elastic emails so intriguing at first, and later filled me with guilt for my much shorter replies thereafter.Wurtzel was kind, curious and often maddening. She wanted to know about my love life, work life, what bands I saw and what books I was reading. “We all get better and sharper and smarter with age,” she wrote to me in the spring of 2014, “but we are never so keen and alive as when we are screaming to be heard.”In 2015, the year she married the writer James Freed Jr, Wurtzel got cancer. “I have new breasts,” she wrote cheerily when I wrote to ask how she was doing. “I had my final surgery last month. So I am getting used to fake boobs. I happen to have loved my breasts — remember I posed topless on the cover of my book Bitch: In Praise of Difficult Women, because how else to say that feminism is sexy and daring. But I love the new breasts I have now more. They are bigger than the ones I had before, and I always felt like a 34D trapped in the body of a 34B. So I am pleased.”We carried on swapping stories and sending each other things to read. She wanted to discuss race and feminism and know more after reading a piece I commissioned on the concept of “misogynoir” – a specific prejudice faced by black women. She wanted to talk about her marriage, my orce, about Trump and the myriad ways cancer kept surprising her.In February 2017, she was reeling from learning that her father was the photographer Bob Adelman, a family friend her mother had an affair with, and not Donald Wurtzel, the man who left home when she was two. A man who she had spent an untold fortune on in therapy bills trying to work out her relationship with.“I am finally writing another book,” she emailed. “It is a sequel to Prozac Nation. Actually it is the undoing of Prozac Nation. I have discovered the craziest things. It turns out there is so much I did not know. Actually, I got my whole life wrong, which was not my fault. So it is another book. I have been meaning to write a book for a while, but suddenly I have no choice. I am so overwhelmed by the things that have happened that I have to write. Which is kind of how it goes.”A month later, she was set back by her health again. “Of all the healthcare crises I have encountered over the last couple of years, breaking my ankle is the most extraordinary. I cannot walk,” she wrote. “I am helpless in a world full of stairs. It is easier just to disengage. Cancer did not interfere with life this way. Cancer is a bigger idea, but if you don’t believe it’s a death sentence, which is never how I saw it, it is something you cope with. A broken ankle is a massive collision with everything every day, starting with getting out of bed.”The writing went on hold and the cancer came back. Wurtzel refused pity or defeat and wrote: “I got breast cancer as a result of the BRCA gene, which is epidemic in Ashkenazi Jews. I should have known to be tested so that I could have taken steps to avoid getting breast cancer. I did not. I was stupid. If I have a recurrence and cancer kills me, that is my fault.”By the summer last year our contact had become sporadic. Every few months rather than weeks, I’d hear from her or read her in New York magazine and the Daily Beast. Her last email, melancholic and brutally honest, came in July with the subject header: “Some thoughts on my marriage failing while being treated for advanced breast cancer.”Wurtzel was still defiant about her prognosis, and so I still didn’t expect the worst.“Marriage is an organizing principle,” she wrote. “It is flow. It is coffee in the morning. It is Game of Thrones at night. Maybe that’s all it is. That is a lot. Now I am an ombré mess of a person. I am missed appointments and cancelled meetings. I am the thing I forgot to do. I am held together by Drybar dry shampoo and micellar wipes.” It was the last time I emailed back.On New York, September 2013Until a couple of years ago, I would have definitely said NYC was the most amazing and beautiful place in the world. But something rotten has happened or has hit this critical mass: it has become a city run on finance and capital exchange and not much else. I basically assume all the intellectuals have moved to LA by now. I’ve blocked out any other possibility. This city is apocalyptically plutocratic.On men and female ambition, November 2013I am left with a feeling that women just are not ambitious the way men are, and nothing will change that. I don’t mean that women are less ambitious, but this is a world men set up that women find absurd and not worth bothering with, so they give up. Women know there is no point in being a billionaire – no one needs that much money – so we are not willing to do the absurd things men do to get into that position. And there are other examples of the same thing at a lower scale. Women look at the silly world men have invented and decide it is not worth it, because it isn’t. I think asking women to change is not right men and the world they have made, which is stupid and full of dumb hoops to jump through, are what need to change.On love, December 2014Love is a rare and special thing, and it happens only because the circumstances are perfect. Love requires serious moonlight.On Trump, February 2017This is a bad marriage. To have a president who is an emotional wreck is to be in an abusive relationship. We don’t want to think about it. It is not our problem. And yet it is driving us crazy. His itchy Twitter finger is making us nuts. His compulsion is getting us where we live. In the United States, the only demographic group that is falling out of the middle class is white Protestants. Trump voters. The American past. I am guessing they like what he is doing, this staccato undoing of America. Yes, this is what they voted for. In states where there is epidemic opioid addiction, they believe the problem is Muslims. Or Mexicans. Or China. Or abortion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/020531ba360d379aff50f601a754b7c413a77e82/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=017337118ddea29886f5dba2dc689f49","title":"keir starmer has the ability and the character but what does he stand for","story":"His campaign team is ideologically erse and he’s attracting support from across the partyIn its entire life, the party of Labour has only produced three majority-winning leaders and not one of that rare trio had hands roughened by physical toil. Two of them (Clement Attlee and Tony Blair) were privately educated barristers. The third (Harold Wilson) was a grammar school lad who became an economics don. All three took their degrees at Oxford.Even so and even now that the party has become very middle class, contenders for the Labour leadership feel compelled to compete to be prolier-than-thou. Sir Keir Starmer, perhaps feeling the burden of the knighthood that he earned for being director of public prosecutions, is keen to stress that his mum was a nurse and his dad a toolmaker and they christened him out of respect for Labour’s first leader, Keir Hardie, a miner.A more persuasive way of establishing Mr Starmer’s credentials as a man of the left was the campaign video that projected his legal career in a way tailored to appeal to Labour members. It highlighted the cases he fought on behalf of dockers, print and pit workers, poll tax protesters, environmental campaigners and the family of Stephen Lawrence. Even rival camps acknowledge that this was a smart way of pre-rebutting any attack on him as an establishment QC and recasting “Sir Keir” as the heroic legal freedom fighter, Superlawyer. When he and other contenders performed at a hustings for Labour MPs last week, it was a compliment to the effectiveness of this pitch that it was aped by one of his competitors, Emily Thornberry.By general consent and rather against the run of expectations in the immediate aftermath of the election defeat, Mr Starmer’s campaign to be Labour’s next leader has got off to the strongest start. It is least surprising that he has mustered the most nominations from MPs, many of whom see him as the best available answer to their yearning for someone who can at least turn them into an effective opposition for the next five years. It was a significant boost to attract the backing of Unison, the largest of the trade unions and one that represents many low-paid workers. He is presenting himself as a unifier and his campaign team is ideologically erse enough to embrace both people who have worked for Jeremy Corbyn and those who have organised for Liz Kendall, the most Blairite of the candidates in the 2015 leadership contest. The first, and so far only, poll of the party’s members has suggested that he is ahead of the following pack.This tells us that the devastating scale of Labour’s losses in the December election has been a salutary shock to at least some of the party. The calamity inflicted by Corbynism’s deadly combination of ideological zealotry, toxic factionalism and rank amateurism commends professionalism, pleasantness and credibility to any members who are fed up with losing and would prefer not to be doomed to another decade in opposition. I have heard of a lot of examples of Labour activists who voted for Mr Corbyn in the last two leadership contests and who now intend to back Mr Starmer. He has also been blessed by his rivals. In Rebecca Long Bailey, the hard left has a candidate who appears unsure whether she truly wants to be the torchbearer for continuity Corbynism. She has given Mr Corbyn “10 out of 10” for leadership, prompting mirthful wonderment about how she would have ranked him had he won the election rather than crush Labour’s parliamentary representation down to the lowest level since 1935. The more revealing dimension of her candidacy is the bitter isions within the hard left about whether she ought to be their representative and her hesitancy about taking on the role of heir to Corbyn for which she has long been groomed and promoted. “Rebecca is quite shy,” says a not unsympathetic Labour MP. “If you bump into her in a corridor, she never says hello unless you say hello first. I get the impression that she’s struggled to make herself do it.”The presence of Jess Phillips as a competitor is probably a net positive for Mr Starmer and it could suit him if the Birmingham MP gathers enough nominations to get into the contest proper. He does not have to be absolutely brutal with the party about its desperate plight when the unflinching Ms Phillips is there to be the blunt truth-teller of the contest. Anti-Corbynite people are joining or rejoining the party in order to support her. Their second or third preferences are likely in large part to go to him.None of which means that it is all wrapped up. Far from it. It is a long and hazard-strewn road to the finishing post of this contest, the result of which will not be revealed until early April. If it gets its act together, the hard left has considerable organisational heft and a significant capacity to turn things extremely ugly. Len McCluskey’s Unite will throw its resources and bureaucracy behind Ms Long Bailey. The campaigns of Lisa Nandy and Ms Phillips might take flight. There is still quite a lot of resistance to the idea that the next Labour leader should be another bloke who lives in north London.Mr Starmer will find there is a price to pay for being the front runner, which is that you get exposed to searching questions about who you are and what you really stand for. Gathering opinions among his supporters, I find that they tend to commend him mainly on the grounds that he has the ability and the character to perform the role. “Keir is the only grown-up,” is a typical sort of answer. Another goes: “Keir is the only person the public can see standing on the steps of Number 10.” One supportive Labour MP says: “I don’t really know exactly where he is on the ideological spectrum, but I don’t particularly care. I trust him to do what needs to be done.”He demonstrated his ability to do a big job as DPP when he successfully led a complex and often very challenged organisation. As the party’s Brexit spokesman, he navigated Labour’s isions as well as anyone could. The well-organised start to his campaign – “he’s got a plan, he’s got a grid,” says one admirer – is taken as another sign that he would be an effective team leader. “He’s absolutely contemptuous of the way Corbyn and his crew ran the Labour party. He sees them as incompetent as well as nasty,” says a friend of many decades standing.Then there are the doubts. No one questions his intellectual ability, but many do wonder about his capacity to inspire. “Keir’s legalistic scalpel is his greatest strength and his greatest weakness,” remarks someone who sat with him in the shadow cabinet. They know he can do forensic scrutiny of the government in parliament they don’t know if he can galvanise opposition to Boris Johnson’s Tories out in the country. “Let’s be honest,” says one Labour MP. “He can be bloody boring.”His ideological definition is fuzzy and he has offered only a vague diagnosis of why the party suffered such a calamitous election defeat. He has expressed some sympathy with the critique that Labour’s gift catalogue manifesto was simply incredible in the eyes of many voters. Yet he has tried to offer reassurance to the party’s left by saying that he wouldn’t “oversteer” away from Corbynism to the right. He has studiously avoided identifying which elements of Labour’s rejected election offer he would junk. It is not clear what this adds up to, even among his supporters. “He is decent. He is a moral leftwinger,” offers one. “He has no fixed ideas on policy.”This lack of any very exact definition has served him well so far. He has the goodwill of figures closely associated with the New Labour years, a lot of backing from the soft left of the party and at the same time is attracting support from some of the more pragmatic elements of Corbynism. There are inherent contradictions in such a broad coalition and they can’t be avoided forever. Some of his supporters commend his reluctance to pick any ideological fights when there is a leadership contest to get through first and it won’t be won by telling the members that they’ve been completely wrong for the past four years. One Starmer-backing senior Labour figure quoted to me with approval an aphorism of Harold Wilson: “The art of being a successful party leader is to turn angles into curves.”Mr Starmer is on an upward curve at the moment, but he is unlikely to get through this protracted contest without confronting at least some of Labour’s many jagged angles.• Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/477e0c989dafc00c1c15d9838bf55280e622ff45/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ab887dd76803e58988622b887b92a45","title":"now harry and meghan are going time to look a true royal horrors","story":"The ‘sins’ of Harry and Meghan are as nothing compared to those of other royalsWhich previous royal crisis does the current one most closely resemble? Given the reflexive British response to any royal drama, it was no time before crack monarchy experts identified the incredible similarities between the abdication of Edward VIII and an overdue realisation by the constitutionally insignificant Sussexes that palace life is unlikely to suit anyone independent and talented, especially when racism intensifies those twin deterrents – the Queen’s household and the British press. Don’t both events feature US orcees, separated only by 84 years and racial difference? Snap.If only the similarities had been spotted sooner and warnings issued. For what psychic could possibly have predicted, having read Meghan Markle’s blog, or seen footage of her, aged 11, condemning sexist TV ads, that she might not submit as readily as her otherwise unemployable in-laws, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, to a career principally composed, for its lead female members, of dutiful handshaking and smirking? Or guessed how very quickly this occupation might pall if, unlike Camilla, Kate and, indeed, Prince Andrew, Meghan were simultaneously to find herself stalked by obsessed celebrity-commentators, some of them partnering in this experiment with estranged members of her own family?If Meghan never, unlike Diana, Princess of Wales, had to run from photographers, she has been subjected, courtesy in particular of the Daily Mail, to a new, permissible variation on press harassment: relentless, condescending censure informed by what 70 female MPs recently described as “outdated, colonial undertones”. One day, a reprimand might focus on Meghan’s relationship with her father, another on her tights, her friends, her “bump-boasting”, her extravagance, her ruthlessness, her unhappy staff, her christening photographs, her meanness to Kate. Not forgetting her Vogue editing, chapel dissing, Queen snubbing, baby showering, baby holding, baby hiding and Harry controlling. In the light of this trolling, the press’s earlier pursuit of Diana practically radiates mutual respect.Among alternatives to the abdication, the Sussex crisis has been compared to Diana’s unexpected decision in 1993 – shortly after the Sunday Mirror published illicit gym photographs of her on her back, in a leotard – to retreat, as it turned out temporarily, from public duties. After much private rehearsal, she delivered a speech that was, according to her disapproving private secretary, Patrick Jephson, “fundamentally dishonest”. “I hope you can find it in your hearts to understand and to give me the time and space that has been lacking in recent years.” The royal household had been alerted but only thanks to Jephson: “Unknown to my boss, I had written a briefing note for the Queen herself.” Colleagues were to expect a “tearful and very public withdrawal”, which, he writes in his heavily disdainful memoir, “appealed to the martyr, the emotionally deprived child and the showgirl within her”.Not having been around – quite – long enough for the abdication, but lucky enough to witness, as a  reporter, Diana’s sublime performance in 1993, I’m more struck by the big difference between that and the Sussexes’ exit: the civility the princess received from her customary persecutors. She had, to media dismay, already delivered one major shock, Andrew Morton’s book, with which she initially denied any connection.Technically, like the Sussexes, the kind-of departing princess was letting down the Queen, occupying a free palace, sponging off taxpayers, had carefully “plotted” her escape – but had no thought of “working to become” financially independent. Jephson thought she was, in the phrase currently popular with disapproving republicans and disapproving royalists alike, “having her cake and eating it”. And yet instead of asking something such as “Who the f**k do they think they are?”, the Mail announced: “Charles Drove Her To It.” “Early reports,” Jephson wrote, “were of uncritical understanding and sympathy.”But when it came to Diana’s son and his wife, early reports abounded in name-calling and derision, principally from the voices whose sustained, seemingly visceral enmity has contributed to the Sussexes’ unhappiness. Or to summarise these rebukes, in the new loyalty-sanctioned argot of the Daily Mail: how dare you fucking escape, you fucking bastards?Why the hostility? Who knows. Why did Iago hate the Moor? Claims about reckless constitutional damage have proved, however, a convenient front for motiveless malignity.The proposal that the Sussex exit, however inconvenient or half-baked, endangers the monarchy should, again, be compared to the serial jolts of the Diana years, also featuring Charles’s Camillagate adventures, the princess’s Panorama interview, Fayed freebies and a heartlessly misjudged funeral procession, from all of which the extended dependent family emerged prosperously intact.More topically, the Sussex announcement is arguably less of a blow to this cornerstone of the constitution than, say, the crown’s inability to resist manipulation and lies orchestrated by the Downing Street bum-flasher, Dominic Cummings. Even with their failings officially confirmed by Madame Tussauds – where they are expected shortly to reappear in a flickering tableau around Richard III – the Sussexes’ conduct may appear to some subjects less outrageous than Prince Andrew’s. If the Queen felt similar fury or disappointment when she found she’d hosted Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, it never reached the press.Turning to another Epstein associate, we find Sarah Ferguson flogging her new “lifestyle brand”, Sarah Senses, in Riyadh, as a special guest of Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Perhaps, encouragingly for the future of SussexRoyal branded merch, the Saudi-loving duchess has yet to be identified as either a constitutional hazard or a royal disappointment. If anything, the departing Sussexes have surely strengthened the monarchy, not just by accelerating, with this unscheduled purge, the slimming-down demanded both by reformers and Prince Charles.Sympathy for the spurned Queen is absolute. And nothing, after decades of mutual suspicion, appears to have united the palace and sections of the press like the conviction that mutinous incomers are a greater threat to a monarchy than its longstanding connections with a predatory paedophile. They could both, however, be wrong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20b95e2e05296aeb9f48ad6bfa011fe74fcc44d8/0_0_2778_1666/master/2778.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fc976a8953751ef0caa2b401c7f7ac4","title":"observer editorial view on harry and meghan decision to step back from royal duties","story":"The couple’s decision highlights how outdated is the institution they are desperate to escape‘Is there anyone in the royal family who wants to be king or queen? I don’t think so...” Prince Harry’s musings in an interview two years ago highlight the bizarre and anachronistic birthright principle that determines the British head of state. As the heir’s spare, Harry does not even have that responsibility to look forward to and now he and his wife, Meghan, have controversially announced that they are taking a step back from their roles as “senior royals”.The surprise came in the manner and timing of the announcement, not its content. Harry has made little secret about his mixed feelings about being a royal and in recent months the signals have intensified as the excruciating treatment of Meghan by the tabloid press has grown. In the first official announcement that they were a couple in 2016, Harry took the unprecedented step of calling out the racism and sexism prevalent in the press speculation about their relationship. Since their marriage, the media vilification of Meghan has worsened and she is now suing the Mail on Sunday for publishing a private letter to her father. This was always going to fuel more vicious attacks, but with Harry’s memories of his mother’s vile treatment by the press at the front of his mind, who could blame them?The announcement has clearly caused a rift with Buckingham Palace, but the irony is that their decision is consistent with Prince Charles’s vision of the monarchy. That the heir to the throne sees a slimmed-down royal family as key to its survival is testament to the fact there is no case for carrying on with the monarchy as is. This episode illustrates the tensions inherent in this ludicrously outdated institution that propels people into an important constitutional role purely by accident of birth. The Queen has been an excellent monarch for almost 70 years, but that is down to luck. Like most families, the royals are made up of the good, the bad and the ugly – look no further than the Queen’s middle son, accused of having sex with a teenager. Prince Charles may be no Prince Andrew, but neither is he the Queen: over the years, he has lobbied government ministers over quack causes such as homeopathy, hardly befitting of a future constitutional monarch. It is preposterous that as part of this charade, the British taxpayer ends up subsidising the lifestyles of “working” minor royals.The Queen’s stature and popularity mean abolition remains a distant prospect. But Harry and Meghan’s announcement should act as the catalyst for the scaling back of this unwieldy institution. Some of its supporters undoubtedly hoped that a mixed-race woman marrying in was the sign of an institution modernising to survive. That it so clearly has not worked instead serves to show that its long-term survival remains in doubt.The justified criticism of the couple is that they have not gone far enough. They say they want to take a step back and “work towards” financial independence, but they appear to want to keep their substantial income from the Duchy of Cornwall, their rent-free residence, their HRH titles and the perks that come with being royal patrons. This, despite having significant independent wealth, huge earning potential and wanting – understandably – to spend a significant amount of time in North America. It’s a strange halfway house that cannot work: they cannot and should not trade on their status as official royals to generate an income. They must quickly move to break free of the institution altogether, both for their own welfare and to smooth the transition to a monarchy where minor royals are not subsidised by the taxpayer in exchange for cutting ribbons.The royal family’s survival is contingent on maintaining distance from its subjects. The more they become like us, the weaker the myth that protects them. The more the barriers between public and private break down, the more royals are treated like any other celebrity, the less the institution can sustain itself. King Charles may feel like an inevitability, King William and King George less so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb5c3df3ed27c413e3188c3081b861b59090f913/573_801_6158_3695/master/6158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8b600ba0e0ddd7737cb8bccab92ef02","title":"on my radar lucy kirkwood cultural highlights","story":"The award-winning playwright on deconstructing the Wu-Tang Clan, her love of Alasdair Gray and the genius of Jürgen KloppBorn in east London in 1984, playwright and screenwriter Lucy Kirkwood studied English literature at the University of Edinburgh and wrote her first play in 2005.

His recent death has made me determined to make a pilgrimage back to Scotland to pay a visit to his mural on the ceiling in the Òran Mór in Glasgow. I will have Lanark in my pocket and toast him with something peaty.I saw this Swedish film last year and couldn’t stop thinking about it for weeks. It’s a love story and a horror movie, but above all a very beautiful fairytale about otherness, desire and what makes us human. It’s the tale of a customs officer at the border of Sweden and Finland with, let’s say, animalistic characteristics that make her very good at her job as a human sniffer dog but isolate her from other people. I don’t want to say more than that its surprises are so perfectly crafted I might spoil them, but it has the most extraordinary sex scene ever committed to film.The pleasure of some art is being so immersed in another point of view that your own self disappears completely, and at the end of it, maybe for minutes, maybe hours, maybe even days, your internal metronome is set to a different rhythm. Sometimes, this is unsettling (Gordon Burn’s Happy Like Murderers put me in the head of Fred West to a disturbing degree), sometimes, it’s transcendental (listening to Philip Glass’s Satyagraha seems to change the whole structure of time), but sometimes it’s just joyful: that’s what happens when I watch gentle Joe Pera talk about a different subject each week, from the breakfasts at his local diner to the rat wars of Alberta, Canada. The show is like a very funny, endearing warm bath that avoids any Forrest Gumpiness with flashes of surrealism and hints at a well of sadness beneath Pera’s radiant kindness.I’m not that interested in sport, and I’ve got no truck with people wishing plays were like football matches, but I’m so glad Jürgen Klopp is in the world and not only because my husband is a Liverpool fan. In the age of Trump and Johnson, he delights me as an example of what male leadership can look like: passionate, humorous, generous, kind, driven by humility and integrity and, above all, decency. My husband loads up clips from post-match interviews and match highlights for me to watch and without fail Klopp makes me laugh or my heart swell, whether he’s complimenting the male translator on his erotic voice, or getting so excited at a victory over Norwich that he breaks his glasses. Also I have instant affection for anyone who’s been a professional sportsperson and a smoker at the same time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce75fca1d4f8b22d2a7288d72e30eaab4ef16d4e/0_1798_3358_2013/master/3358.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14f61632992f9b2e602d1313b3d01fbb","title":"south africas garden route discover the most scenic spots","story":"From barnacle-encrusted whales to sweeps of blooming fynbos, the south-eastern coast of South Africa offers the ultimate picturesque road tripSouth Africa’s Garden Route is almost obscenely good-looking. The meandering drive – stretching more than 120 miles from Mossel Bay in the west, to Storms River in the east – takes in dappled forests, still lakes and surf-pummeled beaches. It’s best explored on four wheels, but be sure to take your time. British Airways flies direct to Cape Town, where you can pick up an Avis hire car, belt up and settle into a truly picturesque ride.Humpback whales can often be spotted breaching clear out of the water at Hermanus, just a 90-minute drive from Cape Town. You can even spot whales lolling metres from the shoreline – keep your ears primed for the huff of a humpback whale exhaling right by your feet. The town hosts an annual whale festival each September – when huge southern right whales pass by in large numbers – and there’s even a whale crier, who alerts crowds to the presence of the animals by blowing on a kelp horn. July to October is a great time to see pods of migrating mothers with their calves and, if you’re feeling languid, the Marine Hotel is perfectly situated on a clifftop overlooking the ocean, so you’ll be able to spot barnacle-clad beasts from your balcony.A 40-minute trundle down the road, you’ll find Gansbaai. Known by locals as the Serengeti of the sea, the waters here are bristling with sea creatures, including the marine big five: whales, dolphins, seals, penguins and sharks. The latter can be seen in their menacing masses in Shark Alley – a sliver of ocean that roils with cape fur seals, the great white’s favourite prey.It’s a four-hour journey from Gansbaai to Oudtshoorn, but you’ll have plenty of screensaver scenery to gawp at along the way, including the craggy Tradouw mountain pass and the twisty-turny Huisrivier pass, which clings to the side of a mountain where cape leopards still roam. As well as the Cango Caves – an impressive prehistoric limestone system, dripping with troll-like rock formations, stalagmites and stalactites – Oudtshoorn boasts the largest number of ostriches in the world, with many of the farms offering tractor rides or walks out in the fields with the colossal birds.Head almost due south towards the coast and you’ll soon reach Knysna – a charming holiday town right at the heart of the Garden Route. Here, you’ll find a vast aquamarine lagoon spilling out into the ocean from between two huge sandstone headlands, helpfully known as the Heads. Hike through the lush forest – thought of as the lungs of this beautiful town – or take a trip out on to the water where you can fish, kayak, water ski and swim.A half-hour drive east is Plettenberg Bay. Home to the rocky Robberg Nature Reserve – where you can snorkel with rambunctious seals – a satisfyingly sandy central beach and the Nelson Bay caves, which date back to the stone age. This is also a great place to take part in a township tour (run by Ocean Blue Adventures). Meet up with a local from the Qolweni community and join them on a visit to the township’s Siyakhula crèche, the central shebeen and other lively spots, meeting some of the friendly locals and learning about the township’s rich history along the way. Come evening, stay at the remarkable Tsala Treetop Lodge just out of town – a collection of elegant elevated hideaways decked out in Afro-baroque style and hidden among the canopy of the ancient indigenous forest.Locals like to call Tsitsikamma, just north of Storms River – “the garden of the Garden Route”. An old Khoisan word, Tsitsikamma means “place of much water”, and whether it’s the yawning river valleys, the flinty ocean or the dew-daubed forest that clings to the mountains, this place is most certainly lush. Don your hiking boots for a lung-cleansing hike around this beautiful landscape, then make your final drive to Storms River, where – if the mood strikes – you can mark the end of your epic road trip by hurling yourself off the Bloukrans Bridge – the world’s highest bridge to bungee off.How to bookWith direct flights from London to Cape Town, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

But it hasn’t always been so simple. She talks about anxiety and hitting rock bottom, ethical activism and surviving Twitter stormsIn the grand exhibition space of a Shanghai art museum, molecular blobs have been blown up on to giant screens to demonstrate the science element of a very long, very reverent summit on skincare hosted by Dior. The celebrity element is Gisele Bündchen, the face of a new range of creams and serums, who will shortly be on hand to help quantify how 30 years of advanced floral science and stem cell technology can help you look better. Being born looking like one of the most successful models of the century can also help, but no matter.“Health is becoming the new wealth,” announces Edouard Mauvais-Jarvis, Dior’s scientific communications director, to a room of 150 or so delegates. Gentle electronic music pulsates in a space with a Kubrick-meets-Instagram aesthetic: clinically all white, all bright, accented by pillars of pink peonies. Chic French PRs circle beauty journalists, editors and scientists, while kooky Asian influencers, like kooky influencers everywhere, take aloof but cute selfies.Bündchen – or Gisele, as she’s mononymously known – bounds on stage after being introduced via video montages of her career and the new Dior beauty campaign. There are lingering, soft-focus shots of her sitting with her eyes closed on a mountain or looking wistful on a beach, set to soaring strings. The emphasis is on the model’s credentials as an environmentalist, activist, mother and paragon of physical perfection. Dressed in flared blue jeans, white shirt tucked into a Christian Dior belt underneath a myrtle green blazer with black kitten heels, her trademark wavy blow-out bounces as she takes a seat.“I’m a big believer in your body being a temple,” she says. Her voice is a deliciously Brazilian-accented husk. She has been put in conversation on stage with Chinese actress Li Bingbing and a local TV presenter to talk about personal wellbeing and the planet. “What are we eating? What are our thoughts?” Gisele asks the audience. “Because when you feel better, you look better. And if we hurt nature, we’re hurting ourselves.”The presenter blinks and nods before inanely suggesting that “If the environment gets clean and prettier, we will become clean and prettier?” Li looks fantastically bored. It is left to Gisele to carry the weight of the event, which she does with amped up professionalism: enthusiastic, chatty, smiling throughout. She talks about her environmental activism, the need for inner beauty and peace to be the main goal, and why nature is a “one-word philosophy” that allowed her to heal her wounds. The presenter, seemingly awe-struck, closes her eyes and nods in agreement.Gisele, pronounced Gi-zell-ee by her family, was 13 when she won her first modelling competition in São Paulo. She and her five sisters, including her twin Patricia, grew up in a middle-class home in a small town in southern Brazil. She writes at length in her 2018 New York Times bestseller, Lessons: My Path to a Meaningful Life, about being bullied for looking too thin at school, of being a tomboy. The book is a hotchpotch of notes, a diary-slash-scrapbook of her life and how she apparently got there. She writes about being name-called “Olly” (as in Olive, Popeye’s skinny missus) and wearing “two pairs of pants to make my legs look thicker”.But by the time Gisele arrived in New York, at 18, and made her catwalk debut for Alexander McQueen, she’d been rebranded by him as “the Body” and “the boobs from Brazil” by Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana. The following year, in 1999, she became a sensation. Editors and designers declared the teenager, with her 36-24-35 bust-waist-hip ratio, marked the return of the curve she rang the death knell for the waifish angles of heroin chic. Throughout the noughties, she steadily became the highest-paid model in the world, and has now clocked more than 1,200 magazine covers.“All I cared about back then was to be like this,” she says, when we sit down together. “Like, I wanted to belong, I wanted people to like me and it was important to me so I would go out of my way to say yes to everybody. I wanted to please everybody. God forbid I would, like, disappoint anyone. And hey, that’s why I got panic attacks.”Gisele was at the height of her modelling career when she says, gravely, that she “hit rock bottom”. It was 2004. She was 24. She’d worked for every major designer, become the $25m face of Victoria’s Secret and landed her 76th cover of Vogue. She and Leonardo DiCaprio had been named one of the world’s most beautiful couples by People magazine, and their relationship was a tabloid fixture. Yet it was her lifestyle, she says, that sent her spinning.“I was eating steak and fries every night. I was drinking a bottle of wine and smoking cigarettes and having a mocha cappuccino for breakfast. That wasn’t so good.” For many this might qualify as an average Friday, but as a world-famous model Gisele developed severe anxiety. “It was uppers and downers, it wasn’t drugs, but I couldn’t sleep because I was drinking so much coffee during the day.”How does she feel seeing wellness and all she lived by transform pop culture? She shrieks. “I have five sisters, and if I find a new recipe or something I like, I share it with the group. This is why I’ve written the book. The whole point is more awareness, the more people get things like yoga, it’s a positive thing. The more people become awakened and conscious of the very decisions they’re going to make, then you don’t have a bunch of people, like, half asleep, you know?”All but one of her sisters, who is a federal judge, work (in various, not altogether clear ways) for the wellness brand worth hundreds of millions of dollars that Gisele has built around herself over the past two decades. Hers is a sun-kissed, barefoot hippy, organic aesthetic contrived as a lifestyle catalogue: all yoga poses at sunset and cosy sweaters and leggings, with inspirational mantras for simple, fuss-free, eco-living.Now, every morning, Gisele wakes up to the sound of the ocean waves from her phone speaker and begins a fastidious routine. Stretches and meditation come first, followed by swilling oil in her mouth for several minutes “to clean out all the guck and detoxify teeth and gums”. Then a workout listening “to a YouTube video on maybe ancient Egypt or Greece,” followed by drinking lemon and water, making healthy breakfasts and lunches for her kids, and sipping a green juice. The school run and a shower are completed before she begins her work in her garden office, the Sanctuary.Gisele swears she doesn’t find the regime difficult: most of her meals are plant-based snacks such as roasted pumpkin seeds are considered a treat. “I do it because it makes me feel better. It makes me happier in my life. I make those choices because it gives me something right back. And I’m happy that more people are getting access to that because the more people who know about it, the more it’s going to make them happier. And if you have a happier world, the better it’s going to be.”If Gisele’s lifestyle now is the warped embodiment of aspiration, it is one she has carefully curated. She split from DiCaprio in 2005, after it became clear he wasn’t on the same journey, so to speak. In 2009 she married the NFL star Tom Brady, after three years of dating. They have a 10-year-old son and an eight-year-old daughter together, along with Brady’s 12-year-old son from his previous relationship with actress Bridget Moynahan.Gisele and Brady’s is a cookie-cutter, loved-up wholesomeness. At their wedding, they gifted each guest a copy of pop-psychology guide The Mastery of Love. Forbes has named them one of the top three highest-earning celebrity couples of the past decade. When Brady’s friendship with Donald Trump caused a sensational backlash, it was Gisele who distanced the couple from the president. As Brady put it: “I talked to my wife and she said I can’t talk about politics any more. I think that’s a good decision for our family.”What does she credit to their success as a couple? “I’ve been with my husband for more than 12 years now and, as you know, men are very… They want a lot of attention. They’re like, they demand... They need a lot of attention, like children do, like your family, your friends. So I think the important part is to have fully present moments with everybody. I think that leads to fulfilment, because they don’t have half of you, they have all of you in that moment and then they get recharged.” Gisele seems to have cracked this one despite the clock running down and her neat ability to filibuster rather than answer all my questions, she holds perfect eye contact and maintains she is “fully here and I’m having this experience and having an exchange. I’m not picking up my phone or texting somebody or thinking about my laundry or my dogs. It’s the same thing with my kids. When I’m with them, I’m with them, on the floor with them, talking with them, really listening to them. Same with my husband.”After a decade of backing tree-planting reforestation initiatives in Brazil and launching a clean water project in her hometown, Gisele’s environmental activism is set to step up next year. Her Instagram feed, which she writes in Portuguese and English, is often scattered with missives that remind followers to take better care of the planet.Given her life at home and with work, is her carbon footprint a worry? Is she aware of what it is? “I’ve been working on something, but I can’t say it right now. It has to do with the movement of regenerating the planet,” she says. “I do everything I can do. We compost. We have a garden. Yes, I could probably live in a smaller house, but we have solar panels. I tell my children it’s about the three Rs: reduce, reuse, recycle. If you go into my closet, for example, you’re not going to believe it, because I have, like, the jeans I wore three years ago.” It feels churlish to point out that in the civilian world, this is totally normal: Gisele’s life exists on a plane of fabulousness because, well, surely, that is entirely the point of being Gisele.“That’s how I am,” she adds, still keen to maintain low-key relatability. “I don’t need stuff. When you need stuff it’s because you haven’t really worked out the inside.”Given that she turns 40 this year and is fronting a line of anti-ageing products, I ask how much she worries about her face and body changing as she gets older. “I think, for me, it’s more about the way I feel, you know what I mean? It’s like, I breastfed my kids for three years each because I felt it was the most important thing I could do and I wanted to give my children and myself that experience – you’re not going to have that again. Yes, it’s going to make your body change, yes I can work out to be fit and feel good and rejuvenated, but I can’t change the fact that both my kids liked the left boob.”In 2010, at 30, Gisele said that “there should be a worldwide law, in my opinion, that mothers should breastfeed their babies for six months.” In 2015, seemingly going against her own well-pronounced principles on keeping all things in life natural, she was papped in Paris visiting a plastic surgeon for surgery on said left boob. Aware of the backlash that would ensue amid charges of hypocrisy, she bizarrely tried to disguise herself in a burqa but was caught out by paps who recognised her driver. She was ridiculed brutally online.“When I did that, I felt like I was trying to please. Because I was ‘the Body’ and…” She takes the briefest pause. “Look, I think if you do something because it is what you feel is your truth, then there is no problem. Then whatever you do is going to bring you joy. But if you do it because it’s somebody else’s idea of you, that’s the problem. So that was another lesson that I’ve learned the hard way. I feel like today, where I’m at with my life, I don’t really care what anyone thinks. I care about living my truth. I care about being a great mother.”She won’t elaborate on her feelings about getting older, suffice to say that again, “I mostly like to be outside with nature, doing something physical like surfing, horseback riding, I play volleyball, run around with my kids or take my dog for a walk. I don’t really exercise because I think I want my butt to look good or this way.” She smiles, fixed on wellness guru autopilot. “It’s important to do those things that really nourish you, benefit you, make you feel good,” she ends. “I think that’s vital.”Makeup by Yumi Lee using Dior Capture Totale Cell Energy hair by David von Cannon styling by Katie Mossman nails by Deborah Lippmann This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Some weren’t released in the US in time others (like The Souvenir) simply weren’t submitted for consideration. Of the titles that are in competition, Bong Joon-ho’s astonishing Parasite is both my own pick of the bunch and a current bookies’ favourite for both best film and the newly renamed international feature film’ category (formerly foreign language film). It would be a worthy winner in either category.• BONG JOON-HO (Parasite) • Alejandro Landes (Monos) • Greta Gerwig (Little Women) • Jordan Peele (Us) • Waad Al-Kateab, Edward Watts (For Sama)Martin Scorsese, Sam Mendes and Quentin Tarantino are all in the running for Oscar nominations, alongside Parasite director Bong Joon-ho, who gets my vote. I’d also like to see a nomination for Greta Gerwig, who was shamefully overlooked at the reliably rubbish Golden Globes for her terrific work on Little Women. My other choices, sadly, all seem to have little chance of gaining due Oscar recognition in this category.• ANTONIO BANDERAS (Pain and Glory) • Taron Egerton (Rocketman) • Adam Driver (Marriage Story) • Joaquin Phoenix (Joker) • Adam Sandler (Uncut Gems)Joaquin Phoenix is the clear leader at the Oscars, with Adam Driver also a strong contender. My nominations would include Taron Egerton for his stand-out turn as Elton John in Rocketman, and Adam Sandler, who delivers his best work since Punch-Drunk Love in the Safdie brothers’ Uncut Gems. But Antonio Banderas edges it for me with a career-best performance, filled with vulnerability and longing, in Almodóvar’s Pain and Glory.• LUPITA NYONG’O (Us) • Florence Pugh (Midsommar) • Cynthia Erivo (Harriet) • Scarlett Johansson (Marriage Story) • Charlize Theron (Bombshell)Lesley Manville would get my vote if Ordinary Love was eligible – it isn’t. Renée Zellweger looks like an Academy favourite for Judy, although she has stiff competition from Scarlett Johansson in Marriage Story. If Florence Pugh gets a nomination, it will be for supporting actress in Little Women, but I’d like to recognise her dynamite central role in Midsommar. Top of my list is Lupita Nyong’o, whose dual roles prove the key to Jordan Peele’s satirical Us.• ZACK GOTTSAGEN (The Peanut Butter Falcon) • Song Kang-ho (Parasite) • Willem Dafoe (The Lighthouse) • Alan Alda (Marriage Story) • Joe Pesci (The Irishman)Supporting categories are always dogged by arguments about leading and secondary roles. Zack Gottsagen could be considered the central player for his wonderful performance in The Peanut Butter Falcon, as could Tom Hanks in A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood, or Willem Dafoe in The Lighthouse. Stephen Graham was a scene-stealer in both The Irishman and Rocketman, although he doesn’t look like a contender for a category in which Brad Pitt and Al Pacino are both hotly tipped.• JENNIFER LOPEZ (Hustlers) • Jamie Lee Curtis (Knives Out) • Cho Yeo-jeong (Parasite) • Laura Dern (Marriage Story) • Margot Robbie (Bombshell)Again, Jennifer Lopez (who is clearly the star of Hustlers) seems to be a frontrunner in the supporting category. She gets my vote. Margot Robbie could be nominated for either Once Upon a Time in Hollywood or Bombshell (the latter is my preferred choice), and it would be great to see Jamie Lee Curtis recognised for her fabulously imperious role in Rian Johnson’s ensemble whodunnit Knives Out.• HILDUR GUÐNADÓTTIR (Joker) • Michael Abels (Us) • Alberto Iglesias (Pain and Glory) • Alex Weston (The Farewell) • Thomas Newman (1917)Many of my own picks (Clint Mansell’s Out of Blue, Cavern of Anti-Matter’s In Fabric, Mica Levi’s Monos, Nainita Desai’s For Sama) were either ineligible or overlooked. Of the titles that did make the already-announced 15-strong shortlist, Hildur Guðnadóttir’s score for Joker is the clear winner – an astonishing musical odyssey that lends real depth and soul to Todd Phillips’s isive anti-hero picture.• PARASITE • Uncut Gems • Little Women • The Irishman • The FarewellCould this finally be the year that the Academy voters bite the bullet and hand the top prize to a foreign language film? Certainly, Bong Joon-ho’s brilliant, satirical sleight of hand Parasite is the strongest contender for a long time. It is the highest grossing foreign language film of the year in the US, and recently entered the all-time top 10 most successful foreign language US releases. And vindicating stats like these matter to the Academy voters.• JOSH SAFDIE, BENNY SAFDIE (Uncut Gems) • Bong Joon Ho (Parasite) • Greta Gerwig (Little Women) • Lulu Wang (The Farewell) • Martin Scorsese (The Irishman)Bong Joon-ho is a magician who has crafted a picture that is pretty much perfect Greta Gerwig breathes spirit and life into a period literary adaptation Lulu Wang weaves a complex tapestry of familial ties Martin Scorsese eschews gangster glamour to focus on the grunt work of the low-level enforcer. But my choice would be the Safdie brothers, for the teeth-chattering, nerve-shredding intensity of Uncut Gems.• NOAH JUPE (Honey Boy) • Adam Sandler (Uncut Gems) • Antonio Banderas (Pain and Glory) • Adam Driver (Marriage Story) • Matthew Rhys (A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood)There’s a lot of finely observed suffering here. Antonio Banderas delivers a performance that aches with sadness while Adam Driver feels the breakdown of his marriage like a self-inflicted wound. And Matthew Rhys conveys muted anguish as a disillusioned journalist in A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood. But the performance that floored me was a heartbreaking Noah Jupe, carrying a movie and capturing the incremental loss of childhood innocence in Honey Boy.• ELISABETH MOSS (Her Smell) • Scarlett Johansson (Marriage Story) • Saoirse Ronan (Little Women) • Awkwafina (The Farewell) • Cynthia Erivo (Harriet)I adored Saoirse Ronan’s boisterous Jo March and thought Cynthia Erivo’s Harriet Tubman had soul and strength. With The Farewell, Awkwafina shows a range that matches her considerable charm. And on the strength of the lawyer’s office monologue alone, Scarlett Johansson has to be a contender. But the rattling blitzkrieg of Elisabeth Moss in Her Smell is like nothing else this year. It locks us into the cacophonous chaos of her character’s messed up mind and doesn’t let us out.• BILL CAMP (Dark Waters) • Shia LaBeouf (The Peanut Butter Falcon) • Joe Pesci (The Irishman) • Lakeith Stanfield (Uncut Gems) • Willem Dafoe (The Lighthouse)Shia LaBeouf is magnificent in both The Peanut Butter Falcon and Honey Boy but the two films might split the vote. Willem Dafoe is immensely enjoyable as a flatulent lighthouse keeper, wielding gloriously ornate dialogue and a noxious looking pipe to pleasing effect. However, Bill Camp tells a whole life story in his scenes in Dark Waters. His performance, full of unexpected textures and tics, is character acting at its most angular and interesting.• FLORENCE PUGH (Little Women) • Lauren “Lolo” Spencer (Give Me Liberty) • Merritt Wever (Marriage Story) • Octavia Spencer (Luce) • Zhao Shuzhen (The Farewell)The supporting performances are often where discoveries are made. Lauren “Lolo” Spencer is one: a disability advocate with ALS, she makes her acting debut in the excellent but underseen US indie Give Me Liberty. And she’s remarkable: forceful, furious, humorous and sexy. Zhao Shuzhen, magnetic as the ailing grandmother in The Farewell, is another new face. But my pick is Florence Pugh, who shines in Little Women, making the trickiest of the sisters sympathetic.• BONG JOON-HO, HAN JIN-WON (Parasite) • Lulu Wang (The Farewell) • Noah Baumbach (Marriage Story) • Robert Eggers, Max Eggers (The Lighthouse) • Shia LaBeouf (Honey Boy)There is a strand of introspection in many of the best original screenplays this year. Noah Baumbach picks at the scabs of his own failed relationship in Marriage Story. Lulu Wang’s own family dilemma – to tell or not to tell a beloved relative of their cancer diagnosis – is central to The Farewell. Shia LaBeouf channelled his childhood into a scaldingly public piece of therapy in Honey Boy. But the winner should be Parasite: there is nothing else of the same exquisite precision and artistry.• FOR SAMA • Atlantics • Uncut Gems • Parasite • Little WomenIn almost a century of Academy Awards, not one documentary has been nominated for best picture. In 2020 this doesn’t seem likely to change nonfiction remains siphoned off into its own category. A pity, because Waad Al-Kateab’s first-person account of raising a daughter in Aleppo is as indelible, and as skilfully constructed, as any of the year’s best fiction films.• MATI DIOP (Atlantics) • Josh Safdie, Benny Safdie (Uncut Gems) • Alma Har’el (Honey Boy) • Waad Al-Kateab, Edward Watts (For Sama) • Todd Haynes (Dark Waters)Best director should recognise the flair a film-maker brings to their material. So: Diop (my favourite) adds a supernatural twist to a timely migrant story the Safdies, madcap energy Har’el applies her grounding in documentary to Shia LaBoeuf’s mythology. Al-Kateab and Watts are bravely direct in their storytelling, while Haynes brings moral clarity, elegance and rage to his environmental thriller.• ADAM SANDLER (Uncut Gems) • Song Kang-ho (Parasite) • Brad Pitt (Ad Astra) • Noah Jupe (Honey Boy) • Felix Maritaud (Sauvage)Those who have seen Paul Thomas Anderson’s 2002 drama Punch-Drunk Love will know that Adam Sandler can really act. As New York jeweller and gambling addict Howard Ratner, Sandler avoids easy parody and instead achieves an acute sense of pathos as a character who is infuriating, unlikable and positively unstoppable in his bad decisions.• FLORENCE PUGH (Midsommar) • Cynthia Enviro (Harriet) • Lupita Nyong’o (Us) • Sienna Miller (American Woman) • Awkwafina (The Farewell)Things the Academy often rewards: a noteworthy physical transformation historical biopics of conservative women blondes. Florence Pugh doesn’t exactly tick all of these boxes as a woman unravelling during the holiday from hell in Midsommar, or indeed as a plucky wrestler from Northampton (Fighting With My Family), or the youngest and most petulant March sister (Little Women, although this might be considered a supporting role). Still, what a year she’s had.• JOE PESCI (The Irishman) • Lakeith Stanfield (Uncut Gems) • Amadou Mbow (Atlantics) • Choi Woo-shik (Parasite) • Evan Alex (Us)The cold, commanding, inward-looking malice of Joe Pesci’s performance in The Irishman is a testament to acting. It’s perhaps unfair to pit him against four considerably lighter roles, but for me, Amadou Mbow’s baffled, sweating policeman in Atlantics, or Evan Alex’s creepy feral double in Us, are just as precisely drawn.• JULIA FOX (Uncut Gems) • Jennifer Lopez (Hustlers) • Park So-dam (Parasite) • Lee Jeong-eun (Parasite) • Adele Haenel (Portrait of a Lady on Fire)This is my favourite category, and my favourite crop of performances the roles might be smaller, but they’re richer, more textured. For me it’s a three-way tussle between three extremely wily and enterprising women: J.Lo’s fast-talking, fur-coated hustler, Park So-dam’s trickster tutor in Parasite, and real-life NYC “It girl” Julia Fox’s scene-stealing mistress in Uncut Gems.• ATLANTICS • Portrait of a Lady on Fire • Parasite • Transit • MonosAtlantics, one of the best films of 2019, might be in with a chance in the international film category: Senegalese-French film-maker Mati Diop’s fabulously smart and spooky feature debut is Senegal’s official Oscar submission. That it already won the Grand Prix at Cannes should boost it somewhat, though Academy voters may lean towards something more accessible, such as Korean crossover hit Parasite.• PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE • The Irishman • Atlantics • Transit • MidsommarIn a year tediously dominated by the Scorsese v Marvel back-and-forth, the American master would have had egg on his face if his gangster opus had fallen short. It didn’t: muscular yet melancholy, consolidating all his thematic and aesthetic fixations in one, it’s a worthy frontrunner for an Oscar. That said, Scorsese already has one: allow me to dream of Céline Sciamma’s exquisite lesbian romance shaking up the Hollywood patriarchy.• MARIELLE HELLER (A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood) • Mati Diop (Atlantics) • Céline Sciamma (Portrait of a Lady on Fire) • Todd Haynes (Dark Waters) • Bong Joon-ho (Parasite)In a field dominated by more obviously impassioned auteur projects, I was struck by what two US directors did with scripts they didn’t write. Haynes is a surprising fit for a legal procedural, but infuses Dark Waters with jittery malaise and moral urgency, while Heller’s quiet, formal audacity takes a strictly American icon – the children’s entertainer Mr Rogers – and articulates his presence more vividly than 2018’s standard-issue documentary.• FRANZ ROGOWSKI (Transit) • Joaquin Phoenix (Joker) • Antonio Banderas (Pain and Glory) • Willem Dafoe (The Lighthouse) • Baykali Ganambarr (The Nightingale)My two favourite male performances of the year are ineligible. Tom Burke should win it all for his devastating turn in The Souvenir, but its US distributor didn’t submit the film. Also not entered: Berlinale winner Synonyms, carried in anarchic, balletic style by Israeli newcomer Tom Mercier. Remember that the Oscars don’t start with a level playing field – or even all the players.• ALFRE WOODARD (Clemency) • Florence Pugh (Midsommar) • Lupita Nyong’o (Us) • Elisabeth Moss (Her Smell) • Trine Dyrholm (Queen of Hearts)Sometimes our favourites are pipe dreams with clear barriers to Academy consideration. It’s harder, however, to say why Alfre Woodard’s staggering performance as a psychologically tormented death-row prison warden has been left out of the conversation: a revered Hollywood stalwart and past nominee, turning in career-best work in a film that won the top prize at Sundance, she ought to be bounding to an overdue win.• BILL CAMP (Dark Waters) • Will Poulter (Midsommar) • Joe Pesci (The Irishman) • Stephen Graham (The Irishman) • Aldis Hodge (Clemency)Supporting Oscars were introduced in 1936, after Hollywood’s character actors complained they didn’t stand a fair chance. Today, they’re too often hijacked by A-list stars in co-lead roles (Brad Pitt in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, I’m looking at you). How lovely it would be to see Bill Camp’s or Stephen Graham’s small but invaluable parts get their due instead.• SOFIA BUENAVENTURA (Monos) • Jennifer Lopez (Hustlers) • Elizabeth Debicki (Vita and Virginia) • Margaret Qualley (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood) • Agyness Deyn (Her Smell)I’m rooting for J.Lo after 20 years of subpar films squandering her vital star voltage: her Ramona in Hustlers is a role that needs a larger-than-life presence to strut it into life. On the flipside, newcomer Sofia Buenaventura’s electrifying turn as burdened child soldier Rambo benefits from unfamiliarity: for much of Monos, even her gender is open to question. Stunning work at opposite ends of the star spectrum: how to choose?• FOR SAMA • Honeyland • The Cave • The Edge of Democracy • American FactoryThe Academy already announced its shortlist of 15 films for this category, and while some exciting work (Cold Case Hammarskjöld, The Hottest August) got left on the sidelines, the remaining field is strong. Gratifyingly, the majority of the films shortlisted have female directors, most of whom would be worthy winners — and while the choice may be an obvious one, it’s hard to deny Waad Al-Kateab’s heart-crushing Syria diary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/381d523258b11dd144e09f59d46416bfb52efcb3/651_394_714_428/master/714.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4af761a9f2c0e17f6c9d78a3576490d","title":"tasty new year nibbles that arent too moreish","story":"After all the holiday bingeing, time for a touch of temperanceWhat I was looking for this week was a chocolate that would be full-flavoured and enjoyable, but not trigger a binge.

Now she wants to help other women in the country achieve their dreamsSanaa Darawsha is recalling the most violent experience of her life, the moment in 2013 when she had to break up a fight involving three footballers and, in the process, took a stray elbow flush in the mouth. “It broke my teeth,” she says. “I had them fixed … but I want to fix them more.”Darawsha taps the teeth in question and laughs for the first time on a bitterly cold afternoon at De Montfort University in Leicester. It is as if she is finally able to relax, having spoken for an hour about everything she has been through. It is serious stuff and, as such, no surprise that up to that point she too has been serious in tone and manner.Aged only 20, Darawsha became Israel’s highest-ranking female Arab referee, a remarkable achievement that required her to overcome adversity, abuse and family objections. Some would have cracked but instead Darawsha survived and thrived, and now aged 28 she wants to help other women in Israel achieve their dreams. Hence her presence at De Montfort to study a Fifa masters international MA in management, law and humanities of sport.“If you are a woman in Israel you are made to feel sport is not for you,” Darawsha says. “I want to create the infrastructure needed for women to play a good standard of sport in the country and also come up with a strategy that increases the number of women’s sport teams. There are some in Israel but very few, in football especially.“I am doing this course so I can learn what is happening outside of Israel and understand better why we lack management and leadership in sport, especially for women.”“I don’t think many people outside of Israel even know we exist,” she adds. “When I came to Leicester people said to me: ‘How is it to be Jewish and Muslim?’ I had to tell them: ‘I am an Arab Muslim living in Israel.’”Darawsha could have developed an inferiority complex but instead decided she was going to make something of her life, and that football would be central to it. At 16 she took up coaching before moving into refereeing so she could remain involved in the sport while travelling across Israel in order to further her studies.Israeli football has a tradition of female referees and there were a few of Arab origin working in the lower echelons of the country’s five-tier league structure when Darawsha decided to give it a go herself. She underwent the Israel Football Federation’s referees’ course in 2010 and, having completed that, was assigned her first 11-a-side game in January 2011, which was between two Jewish teams from the country’s Noar League, which is for men aged between 18 and 20. It went fine, which could not be said about the next Noar League match Darawsha took charge of. Somewhat paradoxically, that was because it involved two Arab sides.“In our society it is not acceptable for women to be referees,” she explains. “I was new to these men and all the time they were screaming: ‘What are you doing here?’ ‘You should not be here!’ ‘Your decisions are wrong!’ They gave me the feeling I should not be a referee.”The experience was scarring for someone who was only a teenager at the time and it required the intervention of a family friend and fellow referee to prevent Darawsha giving up altogether. “He watched me referee and saw that all I needed was to be stronger on the pitch. He said: ‘If you make a mistake, don’t worry – keep going. Believe you are the queen of the game.’”The pep talk worked and it was not long before Darawsha was officiating games in Liga Gimel, Israel’s fifth tier. Then in March 2012 came her promotion to Liga Bet, the fourth tier, and what was a genuine history-making moment. “Arab women had never run games in Liga Bet – I was the first,” Darawsha says. “Suddenly journalists wanted to talk to me. I had never experienced anything like this.”Darawsha was soon officiating in Liga Alef, Israel’s third tier. That was testament not only to her talent but also her resolve, which by then had been strengthened by having to cope with further resistance to her becoming a referee from her elder brother, Fadi. “He knew how footballers spoke to referees, that it could be very aggressive, and felt I couldn’t deal with that,” Darawsha recalls with a notable level of sadness. “He told me he disapproved of me becoming a referee and when I then told him that I was going to do it anyway he stopped talking to me for an entire year.“It was hard because we are a close family. We sit next to each other during meals and talk all the time, and suddenly that stopped with my brother. He wouldn’t talk to me and he would leave the table if I sat there. It felt as if I had lost him.”Fadi also objected to his sister having to wear shorts as part of her referee’s uniform. “This is not acceptable for Muslim women and for my brother it was not acceptable for me to wear them in front of 22 men,” says Darawsha, who tried to solve this problem by asking the federation’s referees department if she could wear leggings when officiating. The request was denied.Fadi eventually accepted Darawsha’s decision to be a referee, as did her parents, Omar and Nura, after some initial reluctance. Yet all of them could have been forgiven for changing their minds after what happened to Darawsha when she took charge of the Liga Bet derby between Tamra and Kabul in December 2012. The score was 2-1 to Kabul when Darawsha ruled out a last-minute equaliser for Tamra after seeing her assistant raise his flag for offside. Cue bedlam.“Some of the Tamra players tried to attack my assistant,” she recalls. “I showed a red card and five yellow cards to the players involved. I also sent off one of Tamra’s coaches because he was screaming at me and my assistant.“After the final whistle the Tamra players were still angry and two security men had to escort me to the referee’s room because they wouldn’t leave me alone. They followed me there and tried to get in. Fortunately there were police at the game – because it was a derby – and they stopped them.”Then came the game that required Darawsha to undergo unexpected dental surgery. It was between Hapoel Iksal and Hapoel Isfiya in Liga Bet and had been proceeding as normal until Isfiya’s goalkeeper got into a furious argument with two Iksal players, who happened to be brothers. It was one of the brothers whose elbow caught Darawsha’s teeth. “The game was live on TV so my family saw it happen,” she says. “They were not happy.”By then Darawsha was having doubts herself about continuing as a referee, partly because of what had happened in the Tamra-Kabul game and partly because of the off‑the‑field stress her decision to officiate had caused. But again there was a determination not to give up and, in the end, she went on to referee more than 100 games. And while she never did so in Israel’s top two isions – Liga Leumit and the Premier League – Darawsha had made her mark. There are now 10 female Arab referees in Israel, the most there has ever been, with many in contact with her for support and advice.That is some legacy but for Darawsha it is not enough. She wants to do more after completing her one-year course in September – which also includes placements in Italy and Switzerland – and despite her reserved, softly spoken nature there is a clear inner drive to succeed, which Darawsha believes comes from her experiences as a referee.“Before I refereed I was quiet and shy but now I am confident and prepared to say what I want and do what I want,” she says. “What I want is to empower women, because when you empower women they empower their daughters, who then do the same with their daughters. That’s my ambition – to have an effect that lasts through the generations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db02da2e6b339f741234c56846daceaf332ad65d/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=722a02a95e77647c34923663001fbef4","title":"i am having a baby with my ex but long for us to be a family mariella frostrup","story":"This man has made it clear he doesn’t want a romantic relationship with you, says Mariella Frostrup. So find out your financial rights and focus on the babyThe dilemma I am a 30-year-old woman and I’ve always wanted to settle down. Last spring I met a man with a previous marriage and a child. We were a good match, but without warning, after a few lovely months, he ended it. I took it badly and then all hell broke loose when I realised I was pregnant. I told him and we decided to keep the baby. I now see him a few times a week and we’ve bought a house, but we argue about him not prioritising time to build our relationship.While he’s often kind and thoughtful, he also seems detached and unloving, resenting any extra demands I make. We don’t feel like a team and he openly admits he doesn’t love me, although he believes in time this might change. As the pregnancy progresses I feel constantly ill with worry and heartbreak, and my insecurities are bubbling over. I used to be confident with a good sense of self worth. When I try to talk to him it usually ends in a horrible argument with him cold and angry and me hysterical. Should I try to swallow my pride and persevere – or to build a stable foundation myself from the beginning?Mariella replies New Year, new you. That’s our starting gambit. It’s the perfect season to take the wheel, determine what you want, why you want it and how you’re going to get it. Your first step must be to take personal responsibility for the choices you’ve made already and work out how you intend to shape the future for you and your baby.This man has made it clear he doesn’t want a full-time role in the family life you want so much. That means you have no choice but to build a stable foundation for your baby that includes him as father but not partner. He doesn’t sound like a reliable choice for a settled union, having already left one child and partner. You say you’ve always wanted to settle down so having a baby after a short relationship with someone who wasn’t intending to either is a curious path. You appear to be expending an enormous amount of energy trying to get this man to conform to a setup he’s made it clear he doesn’t want.You’ve bought a house together, which suggests that, at the very least, he’s committed to supporting you and your baby. That’s incredibly important and a commitment worth nurturing – but it’s an unstable partnership, so make sure of your financial rights.I get the feeling you aren’t taking no for an answer when it comes to a romantic partnership and many of your frustrations stem from this simple fact. This man seems to be saying loudly, clearly and consistently that, while he’s there for you in your choice to become a parent, he’s not willing to sign up for the rest. My advice is to stop torturing yourself and take him at his word. This is not something you should allow to shape your state of mind or self-worth. It’s not even a surprise. Self-delusion is the fastest way to unhappiness. Instead of focusing on what you’ve got, you’re wrongly judging yourself a failure because your sights are set on something else. Your energy now must be on how your baby’s needs will be best met, and those are practical, not romantic considerations.If this man says he doesn’t love you then that’s pretty clear. It also leaves the field open for someone who does – and that is what you deserve and should be looking for once you’ve dealt with your immediate concerns. Your desire to fast forward into a fantasy of parenthood and domestic bliss has been embarked on with someone who doesn’t share that vision – but life is full of second chances.This man should not be your priority, although his support will be welcome in the next few months. Take advantage of the fact that he seems to have behaved more selflessly than selfishly. There’s nothing in your letter that makes me feel he has deceived you. You have pushed for something that isn’t on offer and then tied yourself up in emotional knots because it isn’t forthcoming.Truth is, we reap in relationships what we have, in many cases, sown. It’s pretty hard to get pregnant “by accident”, so there’s a degree of choice involved in negating contraceptive care (for both parties, naturally). It’s a choice that you need to take ownership of.I don’t want to leave you with false hope, but the father of your child still has a foot in your door. The only chance you have of getting him to step over the threshold is to stop pushing him, thereby freeing him up to be enticed by your blossoming detachment and determination to get on with your own life. Save your emotional energy for the birth of your baby and ensure your friends and family are close by.For now, this man is the least important of your concerns. Should you need further advice or support contact gingerbread.org.uk, the charity for single parents. In this season fuelled by ambitious resolutions, the most important one is that we take responsibility for our choices and learn to live with them and thrive.• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

It found that more than a third fake illness to meet family obligations, leading campaigners to warn that the fight to keep jobs “human-sized” is often being lost.The index, which surveyed more than 3,000 parents from across the UK, has been published by the charity Working Families and the childcare provider Bright Horizons since 2012.“This research shows that for too many parents, work is still too ‘big’ for the hours supposedly allotted to it,” said James Tugendhat, international managing director at Bright Horizons. “Too often fathers are working overlong hours, while mothers carry the double burden of paid work and childcare. Yet, increasingly, neither mothers nor fathers want this. It’s time for employers and lawmakers to reconsider the ‘normal’ nine-to-five model and acknowledge that work doesn’t really need to fit into a five-day-a-week package.”Flexibility is also linked to seniority and salary. More than two-thirds of parents earning over £50,000 reported working flexibly, compared with just over two-fifths earning between £15,000 and £20,000.“Flexible working is crucial to supporting parents in balancing their working and caring responsibilities,” said Jane van Zyl, chief executive of Working Families."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/915f21b615e09e41a511468eeab843d84c3c1f97/0_0_1904_2417/master/1904.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d0825f8716082575ea2ca8fdbe8a0c6a 1400w","title":"keir starmer tacks to left momentum makes its pick labour leader","story":"Party should not ‘trash’ the Corbyn years, says Labour leadership favouriteKeir Starmer appealed to the Labour left to back his bid for the leadership on Saturday as he denounced the “free-market model” as a failure and backed higher taxes on the wealthiest to pay for better public services.Starmer’s bid for the support of Labour members who previously backed Jeremy Corbyn came amid signs of splits in the grassroots organisation Momentum, after it said it would recommend Rebecca Long Bailey as leader and Angela Rayner as deputy in an internal ballot.Speaking in Manchester, Starmer said the party should unite, and “trash” neither the last Labour government nor “the last four years” under Corbyn. But – although describing the 2019 manifesto as “overloaded” – he made clear he would also back a distinctly leftwing economic agenda with the aim of reducing inequality and increasing social justice.“We have to be bold enough to say the free-market model doesn’t produce, doesn’t work ... the trickle-down effect didn’t happen,” Starmer told a meeting at the Mechanics’ Institute where the TUC was formed in 1868.“We have to rebuild an economic model that reduces inequality and protects working people.”Speaking to the Observer, Starmer said that while he accepted that the UK would be leaving the EU at the end of January it was essential that it kept as close a relationship as possible with the European single market and customs union.“We are leaving the EU but I do not, however, accept that the fight for a close economic relationship with the EU is over. On the contrary, I think it is more important than ever. And therefore the argument for a customs union and single market alignment is as powerful now as it was before the election.”On Monday Starmer, Long Bailey, Lisa Nandy and Jess Phillips will all go through to the next stage of the contest having gained the necessary backing of at least 22 MPs or MEPs. With 63, Starmer has more than double the tally of any of the other candidates. Emily Thornberry and Clive Lewis were still battling to secure the necessary nominations last night.After a meeting of Momentum’s elected steering group, the organisation decided on Saturday to recommend support for Long Bailey in its own ballot of members, arguing that she was “the only viable left candidate who can build on Labour’s socialist agenda, deepen democracy in the party and unite all of Labour’s heartlands at the next election”. The ballot will consist of two questions and will be sent to members on Monday or on Tuesday and will last 48 hours. The move drew immediate criticism from Laura Parker, a leading Momentum member who resigned as national coordinator after the recent election defeat.Parker tweeted: “Although I am pleased Momentum’s governing body accepted the principle of balloting its members on the leadership I’m sorry they seem to have decided in advance what the answer is. Members should be able to choose from all Leader \u0026amp Deputy candidates.”A Momentum spokesperson said: “We need a new generation of leftwing MPs to lead our party and build on Labour’s popular policy agenda. Our coordinating group believe Rebecca Long Bailey is the only viable candidate who will build on Labour’s vision for the future, deepen democracy in the party and unite all of our heartlands at the next election.”Lisa Nandy won backing last night from over 60 Labour figures, including MPs, peers and council leaders. In a statement they said: “Too many people feel that Labour is unwilling or unable to understand their lives. They no longer believed in our ability to deliver radical change or to protect the things that mattered to them. In order to win back the trust of these communities Labour must listen to them.”Starmer added: “We are in the very early days of what will be a long campaign. I am conscious that there are excellent candidates up against me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d0dc7a5218ceeca0c747415111a6c183a746a8e/0_93_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df3183bacd22a29a2cecde16351458cd","title":"thousands scottish independence supporters march glasgow","story":"March is first of eight planned for 2020, which looks set to be crucial year for movementThousands of independence supporters have begun marching through the streets of Glasgow.The march is the first of eight planned for 2020 by the grassroots organisation All Under One Banner (AUOB) in what is likely to be a crucial year for the Scottish independence movement.Bradshaw told the German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel: “The political class in England – and this includes my own party – must very quickly recognise the Scots’ right to self-determination.” His remarks were tweeted approvingly by Sturgeon.AUOB, which says it is not aligned with any political party, will organise events across the country, in Peebles, Elgin, Kirkcaldy, Stirling, Edinburgh and again in Glasgow, with the next march planned for Arbroath in April to mark the 700th anniversary of the signing of Scotland’s declaration of independence.The march departed from Kelvingrove Park at 11.30am, and is heading to Glasgow Green, where it will end.On Thursday, organisers were forced to cancel a rally planned for the Green after forecasts of high winds resulted in safety concerns.The AUOB organiser Gary Kelly said that, before the weather warnings were in place, he had applied to Glasgow city council with an estimate that about 100,000 would attend the march. He said the programme of marches this year reflected a growing momentum for a second independence referendum.During the general election campaign, the UK Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said if his party won it would consider granting the powers to hold a second referendum if there was a pro-independence majority after next year’s Scottish parliament elections. Boris Johnson has consistently said he would refuse to do likewise regardless of electoral circumstances.Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, wrote to the prime minister at the end of last year requesting the transfer of the necessary section 30 powers to hold a second referendum, and also called for the Scottish parliament to be given permanent powers to hold subsequent referendums on independence from the UK.On Thursday, the  revealed that Scottish Labour was considering backing a second independence referendum in a reversal of policy by the party leader, Richard Leonard.Leonard wants to hold a special conference in May to decide Scottish Labour’s position on a referendum, including the possibility of asking for a pro-federal option in a multi-option ballot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a3283f2241793bd3428054a9d05ddb646058324/219_573_567_340/master/567.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16eabf46b470411c30973e4c2cc6fc81","title":"sweat and the city londons best running routes","story":"Jog through the history, skyscrapers and wilder corners of the capital for the perfect combination of urban adventure and natural beautyThe beauty of leading a running community like Fly Girl Collective is the chance to turn London into our playground – whether we’re sprinting around picturesque gardens south of the river, or ambling happily past a buzzy cafe in the east before returning later for brunch.

At just over 7 miles (11 km), this well-trodden, gravelly path offers the kind of adventurous landscape that’ll convert even the most committed urban runner to the trail life. You get to enter the wild through woods and fields, and up a few moderate ascents.There are cafes and water fountains along the way if you’re using this as a long run and need a breather – or ert into the park’s woodland garden Isabella Plantation so you can stop and smell the flowers.South Bank and Victoria Embankment loopThis swift jaunt around the Thames reminds me why I call London home. I like to time a run early enough to avoid the tourists, who love the South Bank in particular. For a 5K loop, start at Blackfriars station, run south over the bridge, take a right on Upper Ground, then take another a quick right on to Marigold Alley. You’ll hit the riverside, so turn left to follow the Thames and you’ll get to tread along a flat path as you fly past Oxo Tower, the National Theatre and the surprisingly sandy beaches you can spot at low tide near the Royal Festival Hall. You’ll also catch the bright lights of the London Eye, before climbing the steps on to Westminster Bridge. Turn right under Big Ben so you are now going eastwards on the north bank of the Thames along Victoria Embankment. Stay on the riverside pavement, so you don’t have to stop to cross roads and you can enjoy the great views of the Thames and the City beyond. Check out Cleopatra’s Needle and – on the left – Somerset House, before crossing over the road at Temple station. Continue along the Embankment before finishing up at the peaceful Middle Temple Gardens.Hampstead HeathSimilar to Richmond Park, Hampstead Heath is a leafy, countryside-esque destination that offers escapism from the bustle of the city – but it’s especially my go-to when I’m in the mood to tackle some ruthless hills or to get a bit muddy on the heath’s countless trails. For an obstacle-filled adventure, I like to start from Hampstead Heath overground station, and venture into the heath from South End Road. Follow the path and you’ll soon spot Hampstead No 1 and No 2 ponds – in the summer, you might even be tempted to have a dip. Keep going until you see the path that runs between the No 2 pond and the mixed bathing pond the terrain will become wilder as you start to make the taxing ascent to Parliament Hill. Catch your breath as you take in an impressive view of the capital – you should be able to make out the Gherkin, the Shard and St Pauls Cathedral in the distance. I might do a few hill reps here, then seek out the stunning Hill Garden and Pergola, a hidden gem on the west side of the heath.Victoria ParkLike many runners in east London, I’m a massive fan of Victoria Park. From its vast fields and leafy avenues to the top-notch cafes and restored bandstand, Bonner Bridge, the Burdett Coutts fountain and new play areas, London’s oldest park is still going strong. The terrain’s also nice and flat, which makes knocking out a speedy run such a pleasure. Made up of two parts split by Grove Road, a full lap of the park covers just over 4km (2.7 miles) – but if you have more in your legs, slip on to the Hertford Union canal for eclectic scenes of street art and houseboats as you make your way towards the Lee Navigation. For another change of scenery, you can peel off towards the Olympic Park en route for a calisthenics gym and art installations commemorating the legacy of the 2012 Olympics.Tower Bridge to Islands Gardens via the Thames PathThe London leg of the Thames Path, a pleasant national trail that follows the river, is 79.5 miles (128km) that’s usually tackled in four sections either north or south of the water. Though the entire route is a beaut, the 5-mile (8km) passage from Tower Bridge to Island Gardens is particularly fascinating. The first time I ran along it, I was riveted by how it unveiled the capital’s Victorian past. You’ll head through St Katherine’s Dock and Wapping along cobbled lanes, fly past Execution Dock where pirates were once hung, and be tempted to swing by the Prospect of Whitby pub, once frequented by Charles Dickens. From here, you’ll soon notice how the capital has evolved as you make your way through Limehouse, the glass and steel of Canary Wharf and eventually Island Gardens, where the multi-surface path officially ends.Crystal Palace ParkThe ladies from the Fly Girl Collective ran their first ever race here, so it’ll always be remembered as “very, very hard” – but in a good way. The mixed, hilly terrain of this south-east London park is one of the reasons why it’s a big hit with trail-loving runners. It’s got everything – cheeky hills, grassy and stony paths, and muddy puddles after the rain. Another draw, of course, is the Grade I-listed Dinosaur Court – a quirky collection of more than 30 dinosaur sculptures that have resided in the park since 1854. To see them in all their glory, enter the park from Thicket Road entrance on the south side and do a half a mile (0.8km) loop around Lower Lake. Then, explore the rest of the park by taking the 2.5-mile (4km) circuit around its periphery, taking on some challenging hills, or seek out the infamous Crystal Palace Park maze for a fun ersion before heading back south past the athletic stadium, to swing by the park’s charming urban farm – the goats are particularly curious about passing runners.The Fresh Foam X Hierro v5 is designed to go the distance.

He has the accent, a mentor once told of him, of someone who’s “been to Eton” and the confidence of a natural orator. If you had to place him within the complex matrix of the British class system, you’d probably say he was the son of wealthy Africans who attended an independent school and Oxbridge.In fact, Mohamed is a Somali who was born in Kenya, where he lived in a rundown part of Nairobi with his four siblings (another having died), his mother (who also had six children from a previous marriage) and his travelling salesman father. When his father died in a car accident in 1993, Mohamed and three of his siblings were sent to England as refugees.They lived with an aunt and then in various low-rent housing, some of it rat-infested, and were eventually reunited with their mother. A confused and alienated boy, he spent most of his teen years in a state of geographical and psychological dislocation. He went to a struggling comprehensive in north-west London where the headteacher was beaten up and laughed at, but he eventually managed to get a place at the University of Hertfordshire to study law and French.From there he was awarded a postgraduate scholarship to Oxford, gained a position at No5 Chambers, noted experts in planning law, became a successful barrister, an accomplished public speaker and a broadcaster – he’s made two well-received documentaries for Radio 4. And he’s just written a book. To complete the picture of all-round achievement, he recently bought a house for himself. It’s in Wembley, not far from where he went to school. And that’s where I go to meet him.He greets me with a big smile and a polite request that I remove my boots, before making tea and talking me through his story. Even in bare outline, Mohamed’s is an impressive tale, but he turns it into something much larger and far more resonant in his finely written memoir, People Like Us. The subtitle of the book is What It Takes to Make It in Modern Britain, which sounds like a how-to guide to success. In a sense it is, as Mohamed proffers advice from his own experience. But it’s also a rather ambitious and far-ranging attempt to rethink the whole stalled project of social mobility.One of those concepts to which few people are opposed – at least publicly – social mobility has lost some of its lustre. Last year, the Labour party announced that if it formed a government it would replace the social mobility commission with a social justice commission. While a broad spectrum of society believes that social outcomes should not be determined by parental incomes, the fact remains that the most reliable guide to a young person’s economic future is still the level of family wealth. As a consequence there is a perception that social mobility applies only to the bright and gifted.Mohamed is clearly bright and gifted, but his book is concerned not just with people like himself. Although he uses his own story as an illustration of the problems that beset the underprivileged, he argues for the kind of root-and-branch societal reform that will benefit everyone, not just the smartest. It is a thoughtful and nuanced book, packed with relevant data and unafraid to reject fashionable theories. As such, it is a sophisticated read. So what kind of audience did he intend to reach?“I think I’ve got various audiences that I have most hope for,” he says, offering me some cakes made by a Hungarian neighbour. His voice is mellifluously assured. You could imagine him shining in court. “I really hope that parents and teachers are going to read it. I’m hoping what I’ve gone through and the lessons I’ve learned are going to be useful to people. I hope it will be useful to someone like me when I was 15 or 16 and trying to figure this stuff out.”Mohamed says that he’d have loved to have had such a volume to refer to at that age, when he was full of unanswered questions about the mysterious world beyond his limited social confines in Brent. But any 15- or 16-year-old reading a book of this breadth of analysis and eloquence will have already marked themselves out as exceptional.And that perhaps is the fundamental paradox at the heart of the book. The more Mohamed argues for raising the poor as a whole, the more he appears like a special case himself. That isn’t necessarily a problem – after all, if he weren’t, he wouldn’t have got himself into a position to be listened to. But the effect of his pristine prose is to underline the impression of someone inexorably bound for success.Of course, as he is at pains to clarify, any sense of destiny is an illusion. At so many points of his life, things could have gone in a different direction. Had Somalia not been so unstable, his father would have remained there. Had his father not died in a car crash, Mohamed would almost certainly still be in Kenya today. Had a teacher not intervened here, a mentor there, who knows where he may have ended up?“It’s one of those major sort of counterfactuals that bothers me to this day,” he says, pouring more tea. “There’s a bit in the book about when I went back to Kenya 10 years later, and there was a huge part of me thinking: ‘Gosh, like, if I had stayed here, what would have become of me? What kind of human being would I have grown up to be?’”When he was 18, Mohamed gained British citizenship, which meant he could get a passport and travel. So he returned to Nairobi for the first time since he’d buried his father, looking for clues to his identity. He stayed with an uncle who, like his brother (Mohamed’s father), was a natural entrepreneur who had built a thriving business and a large house. His uncle’s multilingual children had attended the best private schools and their lives seemed prepared for them. By contrast, the fatherless Mohamed felt adrift. Yet instead of feeling any resentment, he returned to Britain with renewed inspiration.He realised that the future was there to grasp. No one thought he would do much with his life and that was in a way empowering – “the absence of expectation was a liberating force,” he writes. It marked the beginning of his conscious socioeconomic ascent. For those who enjoy a triumph-over-adversity narrative, there is a lot to savour in Mohamed’s climb. But his real point is that it shouldn’t be unusual and the path he took should be much more readily available to many more people from his kind of background.Mohamed is keen to locate that background in as wide a setting as possible, which includes people who suffer from all kinds of inequality – not just refugees or ethnic minorities, but anyone who feels the system has not been designed to work for them. It lends the book a much more inclusive outlook, as Mohamed always has an eye on what unites rather than ides people. But it also means that the problem of inequality seems monumental. What’s the solution?“If there were an easy answer we would have found it by now,” Mohamed writes in the introduction to his book. Nonetheless, he goes on to call for a massive social programme of investment in pre-school care, education, social care, housing, youth clubs, and much else besides.Though grateful for the asylum his family was granted in the UK, he is scathing about how, in his eyes, they were abandoned by the authorities. After basic housing and benefits were accounted for, they were left to fend for themselves. And while he calls for support for all those at the bottom of the social ladder, the book is at its most impassioned when arguing for better treatment of people in the position he was in.Given that there is already plenty of festering resentment about migrants in general, I say that it would take a brave politician to call for a vast increase in spending on new arrivals.“I have a simple answer to that,” Mohamed says. “If you are not prepared to front load that support in a financially significant way, don’t bother helping these people. Don’t bother opening your borders up to them. Don’t bother letting them in. Because if you allow us in, but then leave us to fend for ourselves, without the proper infrastructure support and nurturing and understanding of the country that we’re in, the more likely it is that you will fall through the cracks. The more likely it is that you’re not going to end up like me. And the more likely it is that you’re going to end up like my half-brother, who’s been in and out of prison, had lots of issues and has struggled, like many more Somalis who are struggling.”This is almost certainly true. But global politics is a messy business. North-east France is already overflowing with migrants desperate to cross to the UK. What would happen to their numbers if they knew that a radically improved social package awaited them on the other side of the channel? Such unpleasant questions are understandably beyond the remit of Mohamed’s book, but not, presumably, the calculations of politicians operating with an increasingly insular outlook. Mohamed is well aware of changing times.“What you saw in Germany, where Angela Merkel made the decision to take over a million refugees, I actually think that that kind of decision without the proper investment to back it up is much more harmful than good.”But proper investment, it seems, is not necessarily enough. Mohamed’s fiancee is a Somali refugee from Sweden who now lives in London. The two of them regularly travel to see her family and therefore he has spent quite a bit of time in Sweden. At one time, he says, refugees could expect comprehensive support in Sweden, but since the spike in asylum seekers, between 2014 and 2016, it has become a harsher climate for new arrivals, and social tensions are growing. In any case, he says, the notion that Sweden was ever some kind of egalitarian utopia is a myth.“They have spent so much more on their education system, so much on their welfare state, so much on helping those people who are at the bottom rung of society. And yet, when you see the actual mobility – how much more money are you earning than your parents? How much more professional are you in terms of the job that you’re in? How much more are you accepted by Swedish society? – they’re not doing that much better than we are.”In which case, I say, however appealing and beneficial a huge expansion in the welfare state might be, it is no guarantee of the kind of social mobility he would like to see. He agrees, but takes a philosophical line on this question.“I’m a big believer that if we can find a way of bucking the trend at the earliest possible moment, if we can find a way of plugging the hole based on to whom you are born, and where you are born, in those early stages, what you then go on to do with it later for me is neither here nor there. So in other words, if we can make sure that every single child from birth until about 18 is able to have the most stable, the most consistent, the most educationally nourishing environment, if they get to 18, and they fuck it all up, then fine.”For all his convictions, Mohamed is no ideologue, much less a dogmatic thinker. He acknowledges, for example, that there can be drawbacks to increased state intervention, and one of those might be a failure to develop inidual or familial responsibility.“When we first came, we didn’t have that much help, or there was help available but we didn’t know where to get it. And what is interesting is that actually, as a family unit, we became a bit closer. Because when you feel that there’s this big bad world out there that you don’t understand, the bonds that then get stronger at home are actually quite profound.”None of that alters his belief that, overall, a pronounced increase in state spending on the poor will deliver better results for society at large. At root, though, he is a pragmatist. As he writes in his book: “I have to deal with the world as it is, rather than as it should be.” It is why he speaks as he does, with his establishment vowels – as he notes, it opens up more doors. And it’s why he has little time for identity politics.“I cannot ignore the suspicion,” he writes, “that at heart, both identity politics and the kind of structural lack of imagination that keeps people like me from progressing have something in common: they both encourage people to see themselves in terms of a single, disadvantageous aspect of their rich and varied iniduality.”There is indeed a point, he says, in employing intersectional social categories to draw attention to the various prejudices and disadvantages that might be restricting people’s options. But he doesn’t believe that it helps if people then define themselves by those categories.“When you start referring to yourself as a person of colour, where does that definition of who you are begin and end?” he asks. “It begins: ‘Because I’m not white.’ And it ends: ‘Because I’m not white.’ So the whole essence of who you are has been defined by something of an other, something over there. Now, if that is where your self-identification begins and ends, in my mind, that’s not healthy.”It’s the kind of statement that won’t endear Mohamed to some readers, but he is never less than admirably true to himself, trying to make sense of a complex, fractious world as best he can. His book does not provide all the answers, even to his own story, let alone the many more he seeks to address. But it’s a careful and affecting study of personal struggle, social mobility and international migration that brings a fresh and well-informed voice to the debate.These are issues that aren’t going to go away, and nor, I suspect, is Mohamed. I ask him if he’s thought of going into politics and he says it’s a question he often hears. He lists all the reasons why it doesn’t attract him – the uncertainty, harassment, the threat to his livelihood, family concerns.“I just can’t see it in the short term,” he says, before adding, just in case, “but who knows?”Who, indeed. All that can be said with certainty is that, if he did change his mind, it would be far from the most surprising thing to have happened in an already extraordinary life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f82642fbb8e33032b47e897ff514155b9ddb9690/0_128_4748_2850/master/4748.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6944122d5f23e37d87e8294d5c4b5317","title":"baltimore ravens tennessee titans playoff score","story":"The Tennessee Titans fear no one. Not even the NFL’s best team.Why should they with Derrick Henry running – and even throwing – the ball, and a big-play defense making clutch stops and turnovers?One week after dominating defending Super Bowl champion New England, Henry gained 195 yards rushing and threw a three-yard touchdown pass in a 28-12 victory over the Ravens. Baltimore (14-3) had won its last 12 games, with quarterback Lamar Jackson setting records and looking unstoppable.On Saturday night, it was Henry who was unstoppable.Plus, Tennessee’s defense had two interceptions of Jackson, who also lost a fumble, and the Titans (11-7) twice stopped Baltimore on fourth-and-1.Henry’s jump-pass to Corey Davis displayed yet another of his skills. He has completed three throws in four attempts in his career.But it’s the way he plows over and through opponents that makes Henry – and the Titans – dangerous. Next week, they will go after their second Super Bowl trip and first since the 2000 season, either at Kansas City or Houston. The last sixth seed to get to the big game was Green Bay in the 2010 season the Packers won it all.Tennessee scored all of their points off takeaways or fourth-down stops.Ryan Tannehill’s throws to Jonnu Smith and Kalif Raymond, who missed the last two games in concussion protocol, gave Tennessee a 14-point edge.Tennessee’s first score came after tight end Mark Andrews, the Ravens’ top receiver this season, mistimed his leap and had Jackson’s pass deflect into the air. Safety Kevin Byard was there to pick it off.Byard scooted 31 yards down the left side, and with a 15-yard personal foul penalty on Jackson added, the Titans were at the Baltimore 35. The hushed crowd then saw five straight Titans runs to the 4 before Earl Thomas came free untouched for an eight-yard sack.Tennessee simply shrugged and Smith made a juggling catch in the left corner of the end zone. Replay determined he landed barely in bounds for a 7-0 lead.A fourth-down stop with less than a yard to go – the first time in nine tries all season the Ravens failed on fourth-and-1 – set up Tennessee’s next touchdown. Tannehill made it 14-0 with his gorgeous long pass that floated over Raymond’s shoulder into his arms behind All-Pro defensive back Marcus Peters. The folks in the stands dressed in purple, who hadn’t seen their team in such a deep hole since the end of September, had gone silent.They did wake up for Baltimore’s 12-play second-quarter drive that included a 30-yard completion to rookie Marquise Brown on third down. But the drive netted only Jason Tucker’s 49-yard field goal.Brown again was instrumental on a late 91-yard drive to Tucker’s 22-yarder as he made a spectacular one-handed grab of a 38-yard pass, also on third down. Getting within one score in a half they were generally outplayed gave the Ravens little boost, though.Henry’s 66-yard romp on third-and-1 led to his passing TD on a direct snap in the third quarter, followed one play later by Jurrell Casey forcing Jackson’s fumble, recovered by rookie Jeffery Simmons. Tannehill’s 1-yard run made it 28-6."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10340465ec900be1173a6a53d4cff009068d1b56/0_1008_4504_2703/master/4504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f0dbee36d437a91afc8dd9a729ec70b","title":"this girl can female sporting activity taboo busting","story":"• Advert will show women overcoming period pains and cramps• ‘We can shine a spotlight on issues that need to be talked about’The original This Girl Can campaign broke the mould by showing women of all shapes and sizes sweating to get active. Five years on the award-winning campaign is seeking to move the dial again by embracing some of the most taboo subjects in women’s sport.A new television commercial, to be launched on Tuesday, will show women overcoming challenges such as severe menstrual cramps or coping with menopausal symptoms. In one notable scene, a woman is seen with her tampon string visible while getting changed for yoga - hardly a common sight on television screens - having taken the activity up to help her tackle debilitating period pains.The Observer understands that this particular scene was greeted with strong approval in early focus groups, with women delighted to see such common but unspoken issues finally being publicly addressed.The original This Girl Can, launched by Sport England in 2015, was based on research showing that women wanted to be more active but were held back by fear of being judged.In the past five years the campaign has helped more than 500,000 women and girls to become more physically active. However, new research commissioned by Sport England found that, while things had improved, more than half of women continue to say they are stopped from exercising, at least occasionally, by worrying about what others think.Tim Hollingsworth, the chief executive of Sport England, said the organisation wanted to be a bold and supportive voice for women and hoped the advert would shine a spotlight on issues many women talk about in private but are rarely discussed in public.“This Girl Can won awards for the trailblazing way it portrayed women in 2015, with true-to-life imagery which had rarely, if ever, been used as part of marketing campaigns for sport and physical activity,” he told the Observer.“In 2020 many of the same fears still exist even though, thanks in large part to the impact of This Girl Can, more brands feature more relatable imagery than ever before and there is a far greater awareness in the sector of how to help and support women to get and stay active.”Insiders say the central theme of the campaign is that in 2020, it is time that women stopped having to feel judged, defined, and told what to do by a society that is still uncomfortable with them talking about issues that genuinely affect their activity levels. “A lot has changed in the public narrative around the gender gap and equality in sport,” added Hollingsworth. “And This Girl Can in 2020 will reflect that and be a bold, supportive voice, standing right alongside women, provoking debate and shining a spotlight on the issues that need to be seen and talked about.”Sport England has also found it helps when sports create an environment where women can feel comfortable, such as offering women-only sessions. The public body also highlighted how five years of research into how best to market sport and activity specifically to women had improved participation levels. It found, for instance, that using photographs of women in the context of the activity rather than actually doing it was more effective in promoting it. So having women standing by their bikes or putting on their helmets in marketing material – as opposed to actually cycling – performed better.A particular success story was a This Girl Can partnership with British Cycling for its “Breeze” events – offering free women-only rides across the country involving a cafe stop, allowing riders an opportunity to get active but also socialise.“Working together to create and deliver an engaging social media campaign, we were able to make use of the distinctive This Girl Can style while also learning from previous campaigns and tests, such as the best type of photography to use and motivations to focus on for less confident women. Their insights combined with ours helped us drive a higher proportion of less active women to our rides than our usual demographic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/499a9720405727a077fa7d92ad77e9e844584084/0_238_3235_1941/master/3235.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69ae10f1fa62a7169f67d50b61344c2b","title":"roger federer responds to climate change criticism from greta thunberg","story":"Roger Federer has issued a cautiously worded response to mounting criticism, including from climate activist Greta Thunberg, over his sponsorship deal with Credit Suisse.A dozen Swiss activists appeared in court on Tuesday after refusing to pay a fine for playing tennis inside branches of Credit Suisse bank in November 2018, in a stunt intended to underscore Federer’s relationship with the Swiss financial giant, which is closely linked with the fossil fuel industry.They also held up banners reading: “Credit Suisse is destroying the planet. Roger, do you support them?” Lawyers for the activists, mostly students, said they were appealing the fine of 21,600 Swiss francs ($AU32,000) on the basis they were acting as whistleblowers for the climate emergency. Protesters with signs gathered outside the courtroom in Lausanne, and the hashtag #RogerWakeUpNow has been trending on Twitter.Thunberg was among nearly 700 accounts to retweet a post from climate activist group 350.org Europe. “Since 2016 @CreditSuisse has provided $57 BILLION to companies looking for new fossil fuel deposits – something that is utterly incompatible with #ClimateAction,” the tweet reads. “@RogerFederer do you endorse this? #RogerWakeUpNow.”Federer, who is in Melbourne preparing for the Australian Open, responded this weekend via a statement. But the 20-time grand slam champion stopped short of directly addressing his relationship with Credit Suisse. “I take the impacts and threat of climate change very seriously, particularly as my family and I arrive in Australia amidst devastation from the bushfires,” read Federer’s statement, sent to Reuters.“As the father of four young children and a fervent supporter of universal education, I have a great deal of respect and admiration for the youth climate movement, and I am grateful to young climate activists for pushing us all to examine our behaviours and act on innovative solutions. We owe it to them and ourselves to listen. I appreciate reminders of my responsibility as a private inidual, as an athlete and as an entrepreneur, and I’m committed to using this privileged position to dialogue on important issues with my sponsors.”Credit Suisse recently stated it is “seeking to align its loan portfolios with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and has recently announced in the context of its global climate strategy that it will no longer invest in new coal-fired power plants”.Federer will headline a fundraising exhibition at the Rod Laver Arena on Wednesday in aid of bushfire relief, alongside Rafael Nadal, Serena Williams, Nick Kyrgios, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Naomi Osaka and Caroline Wozniacki."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42b2ba44d76f401114fb40d361483900ec0cc8f3/438_34_4261_2557/master/4261.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=182f0567f132ab2476c509f86d05f2fa","title":"gamblification football betting act","story":"Super Bowl XXIX in January 1995 between the San Francisco 49ers and the San Diego Chargers looked like a lopsided mismatch beforehand and the reality was even worse. From the moment the 49ers scored what was, at the time, the fastest opening touchdown in Super Bowl history, it felt like the longest WWF bout in history, only without the round where they pretend the bad guy is winning.The only thing that took anyone by surprise was the TV ratings. It was not the headline figure of 83.4m viewers which was impressive because Americans always switch on to the Super Bowl in their tens of millions. What was remarkable, though, was the number who were still watching the 49ers’ 49-26 win four hours later, when the outcome had been a foregone conclusion almost from the kick-off. The game, inevitably, was the top-rated programme of the week but so many people were still there at the end that the post-game show, a mixture of interviews, analysis and prize-giving, was No 2. It relegated Seinfeld to third.When the numbers were examined in more detail, it turned out that, as expected, viewers had drifted away steadily throughout the second half – that is, until a sudden, dramatic spike in the audience figures two minutes from the end. It coincided with the Chargers, beaten and brutalised though they were, getting the ball on their own seven-yard line and marching down the field with an air of intent. Millions who had long since lost interest in the game were suddenly very interested indeed.Why? Because they had put a bet on it. San Diego were 18.5-point underdogs but trailed by 32 points towards the end of the third quarter. As they moved into opposition territory with only seconds left, there was no chance at all that they would beat the 49ers, but a very live chance that they might beat the spread.It never does, because making gambling illegal does not make the demand go away. It also does nothing to identify or help the minority of gamblers for whom it proves utterly destructive. Gambling addiction, in the online age in particular, is often a private agony, with few or no outward symptoms to tell family or friends that a sufferer needs help. As a result, the most sensible way to approach it is a legalised regime but also one in which protecting vulnerable gamblers is a key priority.Which is, by and large, what we had in the UK until the catastrophically misguided 2005 Gambling Act pushed the borders of regulation beyond the far horizon. Twenty years ago the executives of major bookmaking firms were generally lifers who had started out in the shops. Many took the long-term view that problem gambling was not only a disaster for the addict but bad for business, too. “I’ll make a lot more by taking a bit of your money every month for the next 40 years,” one senior bookie told me a few years before the 2005 Act passed, “than I will if I take everything in two months.”Once the borders were pushed back, the rules of the game changed. All businesses push up against their regulatory boundaries – their shareholders tend to hire new chief executives if they don’t – and the gambling industry, inevitably, cut loose. Most obviously this took the form of the high street fixed-odds betting terminals at £100 a spin, but now that stake limits have been brought under control, attention has turned to what some call the “gamblification” of football.Not a moment too soon, many fans will say. The relationship between betting and sport is, they feel, entirely parasitic. If the next Gambling Act regulates the bookies until the pips squeak, so be it. But that will still not address the demand for betting on football, because it is precisely the attributes of fierce competition, drama and world-class talent which also make it such a compelling betting medium. And is betting’s relationship with football as thoroughly parasitic as it might seem?The basis of the Premier League’s immense wealth is its media rights, sold to broadcasters and then on to viewers in packages costing as much as £50 a month. Manchester City versus Liverpool, of course, is a very easy sell, Norwich versus Bournemouth not so much. But a bet can turn an armchair viewer into a Canaries fan for 90 minutes and boost the audience for lesser matches, while the package prices might rise without the revenue from adverts in the breaks. So how much more are people willing to pay for de-gamblified football?Tighter regulation is coming and not before time. But it will come at a cost, for businesses that are competing not only with each other but also with illegal operators, both in the UK and abroad. They will need to be forced to do much to address the harm caused by gambling but, unless we are going to ban betting and have done with it, they will also need to promote their brands.In this context the pitchfork-wielding reaction to last week’s discovery that several major online bookies had been streaming FA Cup matches is hardly promising. The Daily Mail’s “exclusive” was long on sensationalism but very short on inconvenient details, such as the fact there was no requirement to have a bet to watch the action, or that it had been happening for several years without anyone finding offence. Nor was there any need to be a fan of Bet365 or the way they make their money to detect the misogyny behind the Mail’s focus on the firm, and its staggeringly wealthy founder, Denise Coates.Bookmakers will never be viewed with much fondness but at the turn of the century they were at least tolerated as part of the landscape. Twenty years later they are roundly hated and to a large extent they have only themselves to blame. The danger, though, is that, if the current near-hysterical atmosphere around the issue feeds into the next Gambling Act, it could be almost as much of an ill-judged disaster as the last one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b504ef88ce3c68f53009ad30cdbd42a28ca95742/222_0_8011_4807/master/8011.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=133b53c9041fc81517e0c28431405b69","title":"tv tonight winter love island begins","story":"The hit dating show relocates to South Africa for its first winter outing.

A Des Moines RegisterCNN poll had Sanders edging ahead.The national poll of black voters therefore offers a timely boost to Biden’s campaign.“No candidate will win the Democratic presidential nomination without significant support from African Americans,” wrote Post columnist Jonathan Capehart in his analysis of the poll.“They are the foundation of the party, and black women are its backbone. And the poll, like many national polls before it, makes it clear that they want Trump defeated and they think former vice-president Joe Biden is the person to do it.”Booker, a New Jersey senator who is African American, has not qualified for Tuesday’s Democratic debate in Des Moines. But he did attract more support in the Post poll than Buttigieg.The Post noted that the former mayor, 37, “is among the leaders in polls in the predominantly white states of Iowa and New Hampshire but … a lack of familiarity with him and concerns about his experience and sexual orientation appear to be contributing to his current standing” with black voters.Buttigieg, the Post added, “has said that as African Americans get to know him, he will gain more support, but the poll undercuts that assertion.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e60d05965f69cc6af9bb1979b840713a0a53a39/0_0_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e72f66fdb3bc57f765802373b9474b6f","title":"french pm makes major concession to unions over pension age","story":"Édouard Philippe tells unions he will ‘provisionally’ withdraw incentive to keep working until 64The French government has made a major climbdown in its battle with unions over reforms to the country’s complex pension system, which have led to nationwide strikes and transport chaos for more than a month.As protesters took to the streets of Paris for a second day of action in a week, the prime minister, Édouard Philippe, wrote to union leaders on Saturday saying he would “provisionally” withdraw an incentive to encourage workers to remain in employment until the age of 64, two years after the official retirement age.Known as the “pivotal age”, it had alienated even moderate union leaders who until its announcement had shunned the call to demonstrations of more hardline unions, who have demanded the complete withdrawal of the pension reform law.“I am disposed to remove this measure that I proposed from the law in the short term,” Philippe wrote. The PM stressed he remained committed to some kind of “pivotal age” to be introduced “progressively” between 2022 and 2027. However, in the letter, which came after another day of negotiations between union leaders and the government on Friday, Philippe expressed the government’s determination to “build a universal pension system” and the end of the “special regimes” that allow certain workers to retire early on full pensions.Until Saturday, the government had argued the “age pivot” was necessary to ensure the financial stability of the country’s pension system, in which those who work finance the pensions of those who have retired.It was not immediately clear whether the concession would be enough to halt the protests and strikes that have hit France, mainly targeting public transport in Paris and national train services.The moderate CFDT union confederation welcomed the concession and said it looked forward to continuing the negotiations. “We have obtained the withdrawal of the age pivot from the law it’s a victory for the CFDT. This unfair and useless measure was a red line for our organisation. The CFDT will now continue its action for a pension system that is fairer and shows more solidarity,” Laurent Berger, the CFDT’s general secretary tweeted.The more hardline CGT insisted its members would continue to strike and hold protests until the government withdrew the entire pension law.Saturday was the 38th day of protests against the pension reforms, which were a key element of president Emmanuel Macron’s 2017 election campaign. Macron wants to transform the country’s 42 different pension funds into a “universal” points system unions argue the government is trying to remove hard-won rights and privileges and raise the age at which workers retire on full pensions by stealth. It was also the 61st consecutive Saturday of gilets jaunes (yellow vests) protests that began in November 2018.A pensions demonstration between Place de la Nation and Place de la République – two of Paris’s main squares – was blocked after a number of iniduals, who were not in the official union cortege began smashing shop windows and bus shelters and set fire to rubbish bins, advertising hoardings and a disused news kiosk near Bastille. The police, who responded with teargas, advised peaceful protesters to remain with the main demonstration.The official march passed off mostly without incident. The smashing of shop windows and other incidents of vandalism were blamed on rogue elements linked to “black bloc” activists.There were other marches in scores of provincial towns and cities. A protest in the city of Nantes was also tense as police used teargas against demonstrators, reported to be a mix of pension protesters and gilets jaunes.To maintain pressure, unions are planning further demonstrations next Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. The national rail network operator, SNCF, and the Paris transport authority, the RATP, announced they would be running the most services since the strikes began on 5 December but that public transport in the capital would remain disrupted next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f077d3f0287688f9aecd37bdab9124f626006a2f/0_281_2868_1721/master/2868.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ebbde7bd40c2a5bc17826557baa1f9f","title":"taiwan re elects tsai ing wen as president in clear message to china","story":"Incumbent’s success marks dramatic comeback for party that campaigned against unification with ChinaTaiwanese voters have re-elected incumbent president Tsai Ing-Wen in a landslide election that serves as a sharp rebuke to Beijing and its attempts to intimidate and cajole Taiwan into China’s fold.Winning more than 8m votes, the most any presidential candidate has garnered since Taiwan began holding direct elections for the position in 1996, Tsai easily defeated her opponent Han Kuo-yu, whose Kuomintang party promotes closer ties with China.“This election is about whether or not we choose freedom and democracy,” Tsai said, delivering her victory speech in Taipei. “We must work to keep our country safe and defend our sovereignty.”More than 14 million citizens travelled to their hometowns to vote in the presidential and legislative election on Saturday, casting ballots in schools, temples, parking lots and community centres. Tsai’s party also maintained its majority of seats in the legislature.Tsai’s win, coming after major losses for her Democratic Progressive party (DPP) in the 2018 midterm elections, marks a dramatic comeback helped by a slowly improving economy, missteps by the opposition and mass protests in Hong Kong that exposed what coming under Beijing’s authority might look like to many young Taiwanese.Increased intimidation from China appears to have helped Tsai, who opposes unification with the mainland. In the run-up to the election, China twice sailed its new aircraft carrier through the Taiwan strait. In a speech addressed to Taiwan last year, Chinese leader Xi Jinping said Beijing would not rule out the use of force to bring Taiwan under its authority.During Tsai’s first term, Beijing cut off dialogue with Taiwan, persuaded several of its few remaining allies to drop recognition of it and halted independent travel of Chinese tourists.“This election result carries an added significance. They have shown that when our sovereignty and democracy are threatened the Taiwanese will shout our determination even more loudly back,” Tsai said.“With each presidential election, Taiwan is showing how much we cherish our free democratic way of life and how much we cherish our nation,” she said.Taiwan came under military rule by the Kuomintang (KMT), formerly the governing power of China, after its leaders fled the country in 1949 ahead of advancing communists. Since martial law was lifted in 1987, it has gradually evolved into one of the most vibrant democracies in Asia. Although Taiwan enjoys de facto independence, it is recognised as a state by only 15 other countries.Han, Beijing’s preferred candidate, conceded the election by saying he had not “worked hard enough”. “No matter what happens, I still hope to see a united Taiwan … I urge president Tsai Ing-wen to focus on giving people a life where they can live safely and happily,” he said.Han, who had campaigned on the slogan “Taiwan safe, people rich,” backed away from calls for closer ties with China after it appeared to hurt his popularity. In November, when his party released a list of pro-unification party members for at-large legislative seats, support for him dropped.Supporters of Han, a populist candidate who has drawn comparisons to Donald Trump, were grim-faced and some were crying at the KMT’s headquarters in Taipei.Supporters of Tsai said the result was proof of the maturation of Taiwan’s democracy. In the lead-up to the election, citizens were flooded with fake news and disinformation campaigns that many suspected to have come from China.“This is a test of how much democracy and freedom have developed in Taiwan. People can judge right from wrong, whether the news is true or false, and whether or not they will support politicians who do little but put on a show,” said Tek Dee, 36, who voted in Taipei. “It’s a rejection of China’s attempts to swallow up or influence Taiwan,” she said.Others believe Han was the victim of smears from the media, proof that Taiwan has become overly politicised. “This election is a battle between truth and evil. If Han loses, I will not believe in justice any more,” said Xu, a lecturer at a local university in Kaohsiung who asked to only give her surname.Many have described the election as a generational standoff, with older voters supporting Han and the KMT’s policies of closer economic ties with China. Younger Taiwanese have skewed toward Tsai, who campaigned heavily on pledges to protect Taiwan’s democracy.“Tsai’s victory dispels the narrative Beijing has been pushing that Taiwan’s economic and political future is reliant on China,” said Jessica Drun, a non-resident fellow at the Project 2049 Institute.While Tsai has positioned herself as a protector of Taiwan’s sovereignty, some believe she and her party have not gone far enough. Tsai has said she will maintain Taiwan’s current de facto sovereignty and oppose any form of “one country, two systems” – the framework employed in Hong Kong that has been floated as a possible model for Taiwan.The foreign minister, Joseph Wu, said this week that Tsai’s government would not disrupt the status quo with a formal declaration of independence.“If today she said she was for Taiwan independence, I would immediately give her my vote,” said 22-year-old Huang Kaicheng, who recently graduated from a university in Taipei.Huang voted for Han but believes neither party has offered much in the way of policy proposals. “Whoever we elect, it won’t make a difference,” he said.Response to Taiwan’s election was muted in China, with the country’s state council for Taiwan affairs issuing a statement that Beijing “resolutely opposes any separatist attempt for ‘Taiwan independence’” and maintains its support for “peaceful reunification.”Censors appeared to have blocked some of the discussion of the race on Weibo. But internet users left comments under a report on Tsai’s win by state news agency Xinhua, accusing domestic media of misleading them.“We can’t see the real information, so the election results in Taiwan and Hong Kong are always unexpected,” one wrote. “How did this happen?” another said.Additional reporting by Wu Pei-lin and Lillian Yang"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51a686098c3ffff3cb9c3f493126bb7bca4e3ec2/0_29_5341_3205/master/5341.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=faf7321a7b6d08b5f6ad10a294b50702","title":"malta gets new pm after muscat departs over daphne caruana galizia","story":"Robert Abela elected as Labour leader after PM Joseph Muscat resigned amid controversy surrounding investigation of journalist’s deathOutsider Robert Abela is set to become Malta’s new prime minister after the downfall of previous leader Joseph Muscat over the investigation into the murder of an investigative journalist.Abela, who is seen as representing continuity, was elected leader of the Labour party on Sunday, meaning he automatically takes the role of prime minister.In the election run-up Abela did not criticise Muscat, who had announced in December he would quit following widespread anger over his perceived efforts to protect friends and allies from a probe into the 2017 car bombing murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia.Muscat, 45, was set to resign on Sunday.Prior to the election result activist groups cast doubt on whether his successor would bring about real change in the country which they say has been taken over by “criminals”.Dubbed the “one woman WikiLeaks”, Caruana Galizia exposed corruption at the highest levels. She was killed by a car bomb on 16 October 2017 in an attack that made world headlines.Less than an hour before her death she wrote on her blog: “There are crooks everywhere you look. The situation is desperate.”It was expected that some 17,500 Labour voters would vote for the first mid-term prime minister in the party’s history.Two candidates were vying to take over as Labour leader and prime minister: the deputy prime minister and health minister, Chris Fearne, a 56-year old surgeon, and 42-year-old lawyer Abela.Fearne had the backing of most cabinet members but Abela had been closing the gap in the polls in the final week of the campaign, the Times of Malta said.Neither referred to the Galizia killing in the run-up to the election. Both have insisted they represent continuity, highlighting their determination to keep the economy on its stellar trajectory.Martina Darmanin, a 24-year old academic, said she was fed up with hearing that she was from a “tax haven country”.“As a member of the EU we want and we deserve better than this: good governance, rule of law,” she said.Repubblika plans to deliver a manifesto to the new prime minister calling for a clean-up of politics and the economy as well as a revamp of the constitution to guarantee a genuine separation of powers.In an emotional farewell address on Friday, Muscat said he was “sorry” about the killing, the investigation into which he has been accused of hampering.“I paid the highest price for this case to be solved under my watch,” he said.The opposition Nationalist party slammed Muscat’s “surreal” speech, pointing out that it was Caruana Galizia who had paid that price.Muscat’s fall from power followed daily protests led by supporters of the Caruana Galizia family, who accuse him, among other things, of shielding his chief of staff and childhood friend Keith Schembri, who has been implicated in the murder.The journalist’s family had called for Muscat to step down immediately but support from his party and his own popularity – linked to Malta’s booming economy – bought him time until the party election.Three men are on trial for allegedly detonating the bomb that killed Caruana Galizia, while a fourth – a powerful businessman called Yorgen Fenech – was charged as an accomplice after being detained as he tried to leave the country on his yacht.Fenech’s arrest in November sparked the resignation of the tourism minister Konrad Mizzi, who formerly served as energy minister, and Schembri.The murder and probe, Malta Today wrote on Saturday, “cast an indelible stain on Muscat and his administration”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab2890674203208c47a86fed50100aab37b13194/0_28_3883_2330/master/3883.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2694b48f64b2ce43a50ef6ef003aaa30","title":"sardines demonstration bologna salvini far right","story":"Thousands expected in Bologna in campaign against far-right LeagueThe Sardines, an Italian movement that has emerged in response to the far-right politics of Matteo Salvini and his allies, is gearing up for a major demonstration ahead of crucial elections in the leftwing stronghold of Emilia-Romagna in late January. The movement, founded in mid-November by a group of four friends from Bologna in response to Salvini’s threat to “liberate” Emilia-Romagna from the left, has attracted a huge following, with thousands of supporters cramming into piazzas across the country in recent months.The next show of strength is planned for Bologna next Sunday, a week before a regional election that is seen as an important test for the stability of the national government coalition between the centre-left Democratic party (PD) and the Five Star Movement (M5S). The precarious alliance came together last summer after Salvini’s League party was forced out of government following his failed attempt to force snap elections.Support for the League has dwindled but it is still Italy’s biggest party, and winning in Emilia-Romagna would be a major coup for Salvini and his regional partners, the smaller far-right party, Brothers of Italy, and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia.The coalition’s candidate, Lucia Borgonzoni, is polling slightly behind Stefano Bonaccini, the incumbent president from the PD. If Bonaccini manages to maintain that lead in a region where the League has galvanised support in many areas, mostly because of disillusionment with the left, then much of it would be due to the influence of the Sardines. “This is the main importance of the Sardines, to mobilise people and build the fight against Salvini,” said Massimiliano Panarari, a politics professor at Rome’s Luiss University.The debut Sardines demonstration in Bologna attracted an estimated 15,000 people, and quickly spread across the country, culminating with a national rally in Rome in December that brought an estimated 40,000. A host of other events have taken place in smaller towns and cities.How the movement develops will depend on the outcome of the vote in Emilia-Romagna. A meeting of national representatives is planned after the elections, leading many to believe it could become a political party, despite denials by Mattia Santori, one of the founders.“If Salvini’s coalition wins in Emilia-Romagna, which would mean a political earthquake for the PD, then there could be the possibility of the Sardines transforming themselves into an organised structure as the PD’s failure would leave a void in the left,” said Panarari. “If the PD is able to resist, and thanks also to the Sardines’ ability to mobilise voters, I think the leaders of existing leftwing parties could invite the most prominent Sardines members to join them.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4137307.1578765192!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin s late night kebab shop iskander s to close after nearly three decades","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStaff at Iskander’s kebab house on Dublins Dame Street, Parsed Ramphul, Nicole Montalvo and Duran Duran. Photograph: Alan BetsonDublin’s original kebab shop is set to close its doors later this month for a major refurbishment and relaunch following nearly 28 years of providing late-night snacks to hungry city-centre revellers.Iskander’s Kebab House on Dame Street, which has been in operation since 1992, will close on January 19th to allow for a complete renovation of the premises. The late-night food takeaway was recently bought by the Aydin family who say they are planning to reopen in mid-February as a more upmarket restaurant.Ali Aydin, whose father started working at Iskander’s in 2000 shortly after the family moved to Ireland from Turkey, says the kebab shop was the first of its kind in the city centre and introduced passersby to the tastes of North Africa and the Middle East.“Being open till half five in the morning it started a trend of eating a kebab after a night out on the town with many other shops following in its footsteps,” said Mr Aydin. “It paved the way for the terms ‘shawarma’ and ‘doner kebab’ being widely known in the Dublin region.”One Iskander’s staff member, who has worked at the shop for 24 years, recalled to Mr Aydin how hundreds of people would queue outside the shop in the early hours of the morning eagerly awaiting their kebab. “He said they were pushing out 1,600 orders a day. People were intrigued and trying to find out what this new food was. It was something they’d never seen before.”It’s believed the original owner was Algerian but the shop was subsequently sold on to an Irish owner. In the late 1990s other kebab shops started to spring up around the city centre including the popular Zaytoon chain which opened its first Café Topolis premises in 1996.Mr Aydin says he enjoyed working behind the till while at college and that the late-night antics among customers “aren’t as bad as people make them out to be”. “Nearly all kebab shops have security after 1am but I don’t see the need for it because there aren’t as many problems as there used to be. We used to hear stories of fights between customers but we don’t see that anymore. People seem more chilled.”The Aydin family had recently noticed a change in customer preferences with more people choosing to eat their fare for lunch or dinner rather than after a night out. “We’ve been seeing less people coming in at 4am and more families during the day. Other places are renovating and placing more focus on the environment where people eat.”Jamal (Jimmy) Aydin, Ali’s uncle, said the family had spent the past three years making plans on how they could purchase and refurbish the shop.“We want to have a more modern concept, the place needs updating. We thought it would be good to tell people in advance because Iskander’s has been open for such a long time,” he said. “We didn’t want to just shut the doors.”He said the new restaurant will no longer be called Iskander’s."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4131656.1578312358!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"on a frosty morning 40 years ago i saw a group of dolphins playing tag","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe shiny black backs that came curving along the waves behind me were those of bottlenose dolphins, out for their own kind of fun. Picture: Michael VineyOn a frosty morning after Christmas in our first winter in the west more than 40 years ago, I went walking north along the shore. An early stretch, once I’d left the strand, was an obstacle course of rocky headlands and ravines, an old grass road scalloped on eroding cliffs and hurdled with the tangled ends of fences.But the whole arc of mountains from Achill to Renvyle were gleaming with snow. And at Carrowniskey Strand, with the wet sand as a mirror, Clare Island floated offshore like a great white sail.Carrowniskey shelves slowly into the deep, its long terraces of breakers piling up into crests that today bring many surfers to this shore. But the shiny black backs that came curving along the waves behind me were those of bottlenose dolphins, out for their own kind of fun.“Then came half a dozen more,” I reported in this column, “cavorting in the wintry surf as if Mayo were in west Africa.” Which tells how much I knew about bottlenose dolphins – or “Huzza Porpoises”, as the headline boldly and ignorantly proclaimed.I had borrowed that phrase from Melville’s Moby Dick and his term for the “hilarious shoals” that so often shadowed his whaler. “If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish,” he wrote, “then heaven help ye the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye.”My own godless spirit was, indeed, exalted by the exuberance of the “porpoises” playing tag among the breakers and leaping from the water in glittering founts of spray. Their play seemed quite deliberate, a performance for the solitary human figure on the shore, Then they calmed down and swam on.My use of “porpoises” is still mortifying, but I had yet to learn about the mammals of the sea. Porpoises are the commonest and by far the smallest of Ireland’s 24 species of cetacean, and their shoals have little aspiration to hilarity. Some big Scottish bottlenoses even beat them up.My magical visitors, I know today, were from a large social community of bottlenoses based off the coast of Connemara and west Mayo. Some 200 have been photographed for the IWDG’s photo ID catalogue. But 40 years ago, cetacean wildlife was almost blanked from Irish natural history.Before marine scientists and fellow enthusiasts formed the IWDG (Irish Whale and Dolphin Group) in December 1990, the variety and extent of our cetacean life was held in random records of stranded corpses and in the logbooks of a small Norwegian whaling enterprise based briefly on the Mullet, in north Mayo.Today’s research cruises and postmortems have been building the story of cetacean biology, lifestyle and pathology. This action for conservation was implicit in Charles Haughey’s 1991 declaration of Ireland’s pioneering whale and dolphin sanctuary .Just a few weeks ago came results of a study by Galway Mayo Institute and the Marine Institute. It analysed blubber samples from three killer whales, or orcas, stranded dead in Galway, Mayo and Waterford, and from a near-term calf inside one of them.The tests were part of intensive global monitoring of the impact on cetaceans of toxic industrial chemicals and pesticides. The chemical concentrations in the Irish blubber were disturbingly high, but still far from those found in some parts of the Mediterranean and elsewhere. In an earlier world-wide survey of dolphins and porpoises, bottlenoses resident in the Shannon Estuary showed the lowest concentrations of all.As top predators in the ocean, the dolphins, of which orcas are the biggest, accumulate the most man-made toxic pollutants, in particular the persistent polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Their “biomagnification” in cetacea was first detected in the 1960s, when PCBs were still widely used in insulation of electrical equipment.They were phased out in the EU in the mid-1980s, to good immediate effect, but their persistence is still echoed in the dolphins. Reproduction can be suppressed and females pass PCBs into their offspring. One pod of orcas, living between northwest Scotland and Ireland, has not produced a calf in 19 years of observation.Meanwhile, Ireland’s best-known bottlenose, the loyal Fungie of Dingle Harbour, was admitted last September to the Guinness Book of Records as the longest-lived “solitary-sociable” dolphin on record. He first appeared off Dingle in 1983, which puts him as the earliest of 114 living, solitary and mostly bottlenose dolphins engaging with humans on shores around the world. The report on them, Lone Rangers, was prepared by Marine Connection, a UK-based animal welfare charity (at marineconnection.org).Much less eager for human encounters and lately gashed by a boat propeller, Fungie is nearing the 40 years reckoned as the limit to the life for his kind. His relationship with people has been remarkably free of the misunderstandings, sometimes sexual or aggressive, that have marked some Irish bottlenose encounters.For the IWDG, even sociable wild dolphins are best left to wild lives."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4137247.1578760957!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"foster pledges to get northern ireland moving as assembly sits again","story":"First Minister of Nothern Ireland Arlene Foster declares that it\u0027s time to get Northern Ireland moving forward again as politicians sit in Stormont for the first time in three years.

Photograph:  Paul FaithAFPGettyThree years after its collapse the Northern Assembly was formally back in business at lunchtime on Saturday following Thursday night’s publication of the British-Irish agreement to restore Stormont.And as the wheels of the powersharing administration slowly cranked back into gear after 36 months of paralysis the incoming DUP First Minister Arlene Foster pledged to “get Northern Ireland moving forward again”.“We won’t solve every problem immediately but local Ministers will get on with key reforms in schools and hospitals,” she promised.The session of the Assembly began at 1 pm with the election of a speaker and deputy speakers, with DUP East Derry DUP Assembly member, George Robinsons initially chairing proceedings.Before moving to those elections he went though the list of members who had resigned or been replaced since the last full meeting of the Assembly three years ago.There were three nominations for the position of speaker, Alex Maskey of Sinn Féin a West Belfast MLA East Antrim MLA Roy Beggs of the Ulster Unionist Party and Mid-Ulster SDLP MLA Patsy McGlone.Peter Weir of the DUP caused some surprise by stating his party was supporting Mr Maskey for the speaker position, appearing to demonstrate that from the outset his party and Sinn Féin were determined to make the restored dispensation work.Mr Weir said the MLAs were embarking on a “long journey, a never-ending journey to make life better for all of us”, while adding, “It is a challenge to all of us to work together.”To no surprise the first discordant note of the day came from Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister who referring to the title of the deal, New Decade, New Approach, said it was the same “old carve up between DUP and Sinn Féin”.“Nothing has changed, nothing is new and nothing good will come of it,” he said, while adding that the sight of DUP MLAs trooping through the lobby to “support a Sinn Féin speaker will not be lost on many”.Mr Allister would have preferred to see Mr Beggs or Mr McGlone as speaker because “neither of them has baggage that would prevent them from doing the job”. It was “the same old, same old”, he complained.Nonetheless, the vote was held and Mr Maskey was duly elected, and normal business could begin with the Sinn Féin MLA in the speaker’s chair.Sinn Féin applauded his election in the chamber but the DUP members did not, although DUP members voted for him.Mr Maskey offered a big “hardy thank you” to those who voted for him, and said it was significant he was elected by a cross-community vote. He hoped the Assembly could continue its work in a “spirit of generosity” and “reconciliation”.Business then continued through the afternoon with the next due order of business electing deputy speakers.Those elected to the deputy speaker posts were Christopher Stalford of the DUP, Roy Beggs of the UUP and Patsy McGlone of the SDLP.The next work was the election of a business committee followed by the election of DUP leader Arlene Foster as First Minister and Sinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O’Neill as Deputy First Minister, and then a new Executive.That work was expected to take until about 4.30 pm.Northern Secretary Julian Smith and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney whose publication of their New Decade, New Approach agreement late on Thursday prompted the parties to re-enter Stormont were not present but wished the parties well.Mr Smith had warned that if there was no agreement by 11.59 pm on this coming Monday he would call Assembly elections - a challenge most parties, particularly the DUP and Sinn Féin, did not want to face.“What a week,” wrote Mr Coveney in a tweet. “The ingredients of pace, leadership and a fixed deadline have given the politics of this place another chance,” he added.In a tweet to the leaders of the five main parties Mr Smith wrote, “Well done \u0026amp good luck!”The Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar said: “This is a historic day for Northern Ireland.”“All parties and politicians in Northern Ireland are to be commended for their decision to put the people they represent first and make measured compromises to reach a deal. I want to thank the Tánaiste Simon Coveney, Secretary of State Julian Smith, and their teams, for the enormous effort and hard work over the last number of months in drafting New Decade, New Approach.”He added: “I look forward to working with representatives in Northern Ireland as they begin working together again on behalf of all people in Northern Ireland. I am also looking forward to an early meeting of the North South Ministerial Council as part of working with the Northern Ireland executive, in the interest of everyone on this island.”UK prime minister Boris Johnson described the day as momentous, and said in a statement: “As we begin a new decade, we can now look forward to a brighter future for all in Northern Ireland, with an Executive that can transform public services and improve people’s lives.“The parties of Northern Ireland have shown great leadership in coming together to accept this fair and balanced deal in the interests of everyone in Northern Ireland.“After three years without devolved Government, an Executive can now get on with the job of delivering much-needed reforms to the health service, education and justice.“We could not have got this far without the Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith who has dedicated himself to this process and has worked closely with the Northern Ireland parties and Irish Government to make this happen.”Under the new deal, the new Executive and Assembly will deal with a wide range of matters such as the Irish language, the sustainability of a reformed Assembly and the petition of concern.The British and Irish governments also promised a major injection of financial support to address matters such as the health crisis, education, housing, infrastructure and building the Northern Ireland economy"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4136264.1578689838!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the northern capacity to focus on the negative can be breathtaking","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCanvassing politicians were told repeatedly last year that the people wanted Stormont back so local politicians could tackle local problems. Photograph: Getty ImagesPolitics, said Otto Von Bismarck, is the art of the possible, but listening to some of the initial reaction to the New Decade, New Approach deal to get Stormont functioning again you could not help wondering would some prefer the old decade and the old approach.Still, the deal was done, and today at Stormont it’s back to business, and it was in its own way, as Mary Lou McDonald said, a “lá stairiúil” (historic day).That resolution, after three years of different bouts of negotiation, was announced on a bitterly cold night in front of Parliament Buildings at Stormont on Thursday, where Simon Coveney and Julian Smith were clear that signing up to their 62-page document would require compromise. But with the pain there would be a lot more gain, the Tánaiste and Northern Secretary pledged.And that does seem apparent from what is on offer .However, in the initial responses there was quite a degree of focus on the negative. That was characterised by the opening minutes of BBC Radio Ulster’s Stephen Nolan Show .The first question he asked his many thousands of listeners was: “Have we in Northern Ireland just heard political blackmail on the airwaves from the Secretary of State?”This caused some outrage to the presenter who went into a riff about Smith holding cancer patients, people on waiting lists, and children in school “hostage” over his “no deal, no money” insistence.The first politician on the programme was Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who was happy to agree with Nolan that in terms of the vexed and sensitive issue of the Irish language, DUP leader and prospective First Minister Arlene Foster ultimately would have a veto over how the language legislation was applied and that there would be no “Irish road signs”.Northern Ireland can be a strange place. All that focus is fair enough, up to a point, but the Northern capacity to accentuate the negative can be breathtaking at times.After all, the North is gripped in a health crisis. There has been political sclerosis for the past three years there are serious problems in education and public services. Every politician when canvassing on the doorsteps during the three elections of last year was told the people wanted Stormont back so that local politicians could tackle local problems.You would have expected some concentration on the fact that here was an opportunity not only to resurrect Stormont but, with a little political generosity, the positive spirit of the Belfast Agreement, here was a deal that could work.Emphatic messageHow to get above that negativity is the challenge, and you would expect that for most people what is on offer is quite comprehensive and positive. Certainly that was the response from business, farming and civic society. “Get on with it,” was their emphatic message.The British-Irish agreement promises a huge injection of cash to address the health crisis, to deal with the demands of education, to improve infrastructure, to deal with a wide range of other projects – all contingent on the resumption of the Executive and Assembly.It addresses the big issues such as the Irish language, the sustainability of a future Assembly and the petition of concern, an issue that might make most people’s eyes glaze over but is important for many politicians in the North.And it does, as Coveney and Smith said, involve compromise. Let’s look at some of the key points of New Decade, New Approach.Some Irish language representatives complain that the agreement does not offer a standalone Irish language Act as they demanded. But it does offer a three-stranded legislative approach addressing identity and cultural expression for Irish and Ulster Scots.There will be an Office of Identity and Cultural Expression to promote cultural pluralism legislation to create a commissioner to “recognise, support, protect and enhance the development of the Irish language in Northern Ireland and to provide official recognition of the status of the Irish language in Northern Ireland” – with the same going for Ulster Scots.And going back into the mists of time the Administration of Justice (Language) Act (Ireland) 1737 will be repealed. That Act meant only English could be used in Northern Ireland courts.Assembly business also will be amended so that MLAs can speak solely in Irish or Ulster Scots.As Donaldson said, there appears to be nothing in the document that allows for Irish road signs, which will make life a bit awkward for Sinn Féin.Integrated packageStill, it seems there will be an Irish language Act although not a “standalone” one, as these three Bills “will be introduced as part of an integrated package of legislation”. All rather Jesuitical, but raise a cheer for a semantic Northern Ireland solution to a Northern Ireland problem.All this legislation will be overseen by the DUP First Minister and Sinn Féin Deputy First Minister, which, as some have interpreted, will give the DUP a veto over how Irish language legislation will be implemented.We are back, therefore, to good will and political bona fides.What is absolutely key here is that three years ago the Assembly collapsed for a range of reasons but chiefly because nationalism felt disrespected, held in contempt, by the DUP.Privately several DUP people acknowledge that point: that Foster’s crocodile remarks in relation to the Irish language, Gregory Campbell’s “curry my yogurt” comments and other actions opened up deep nationalist wounds. Therefore, for these Irish language proposals to work Foster will have to show goodwill .If the big political beasts of the DUP and Sinn Féin can’t show good manners to each other then there is little chance of this place working. That is the inescapable lesson from recent years. There is a mutual DUP-Sinn Féin interdependency that could keep this working.There is what appears to be a cracking good idea to have an early warning system operating in the new Executive to prevent incidents such as the row that led to McGuinness resigning three years ago. Called a “party leaders’ forum”, one of its functions will be to anticipate and deal with problems before they escalate into Assembly-threatening crises.And on the sustainability of a restored Executive, the deal means that in the face of another breakdown the Executive will continue to function in “caretaker” form for 24 weeks before an election must be called.There are minor changes to the petition of concern. Hitherto, with 30 signatories motions could be vetoed even if they had majority support in the Assembly, as happened with the proposal to introduce same-sex marriage in the North.Under the agreement the parties “commit to tabling or supporting petitions of concern only in the most exceptional circumstances and as a last resort having used every other available mechanism”.The threshold for a successful petition remains 30 signatories but a petition can only be triggered by two or more parties. This seems academic as no single party has 30 members.Greater transparencyConscious of the Renewable Heat Incentive calamity – the cash-for-ash inquiry report is due soon – the deal also has a specific statement that “the parties reaffirm their commitment to greater transparency and improved governance arrangements that are aimed at securing and maintaining public confidence”.The British union flag will fly over British government and court houses for three extra days each years, bringing the number of days the flag flies from about 18 to about 21 – the number of days varies each year.The new Executive will implement a “shared and ambitious strategic vision for the future with the aim of improving lives across Northern Ireland”.All that will require truckloads of money to pay for the programme for government. Smith was adamant all that largesse depended on the politicians getting back into the Assembly and Executive, which gave rise to the accusation of political blackmail.But hardnosed Smith was holding the line. Maybe that is a form of blackmail but understandable in terms of getting Northern Ireland to work.This incoming Northern Executive and Assembly has a chance if the essential premise at the heart of it is applied, that the parties “return to the institutions on the basis of good faith, mutual respect and trust – underpinned by strong working relationships”."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Iran plane crash: British ambassador says his detention was \u0026#39of course illegal\u0026#39 in first statement since arrestComment: The Conservatives are not losing control of public spending, they\u0026#39re simply taking advantage of cheap moneyStiff upper lip means war babies will not seek  help for depression Comment: Life as the \u0026#39spare\u0026#39 younger Royal sibling isn\u0026#39t much funShopping ethically adds almost £500 to annual shopping bill, research findsVegetables grown without soil for first time using nutrient root sprayOne in 12 offers made by a single Oxford college have gone to pupils from two elite private schoolsRevealed: The schools which send the highest number of pupils to every Oxbridge collegeExercise books are \u0026#39old fashioned\u0026#39 and paperless schools are the future,  leading headmistress saysRoyal Navy in daring mission to deliver beer to thirsty Australians stranded by bushfiresUS set to expel more than a dozen Saudi military trainees following terror attack in FloridaAustralia bushfires: Scott Morrison admits regret over his response to fires and promises inquiryRobert Abela wins election to be prime minister of Malta and calls for unity after Joseph Muscat\u0026#39s resignation over journalist\u0026#39s murderReynhard Sinaga: Mother of Britain\u0026#39s most prolific rapist says he is still \u0026#39my baby\u0026#39Britain must be ready to fight wars without US help, says defence secretaryBritish ambassador to Iran arrested and held for several hours in Tehran after attending vigilSir David Lidington and Sir Patrick McLoughlin among 10 new Tory peers to be created by end of monthConservative donors will fund new grassroots organisations to help Tory MPs who won general election seatsSussex Royal foundation expected to launch in April as couple face stumbling block over Hollywood celebrity donations Comment: It is time for Iran to come to the negotiating tableWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/02/TELEMMGLPICT000170900822_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"one 12 offers made single oxford college have gone pupils two","story":"At Magdalen College, Oxford, one in every 12 offers over the past three years were made to pupils from either Eton College or Westminster SchoolOne in every 12 offers made by a single Oxford college have gone to pupils from two elite private schools, new data reveals. Of the 300 undergraduate offers that Magdalen College has made in the past three years, 25 have been to pupils from either Eton College or Westminster School, according to figures obtained by The Sunday .    Meanwhile, Cambridge’s Trinity College has offered 19 places to students from Westminster School over the same period, including eight in 2018 alone. It means that students from the central London school, which charges £41,600-per-year for boarders, got the same number of offers that year as all of Britain’s sixth form colleges combined.   Trinity has been formally linked to Westminster since 1560, and until 2018 the college’s Master was automatically a governor of the school.  Revealed: The schools which send the highest number of pupils to every Oxbridge collegeThis newspaper obtained data, under the Freedom of Information Act, from every Oxford and Cambridge college on the schools they have made the most offers to since 2017. It is the first time that this information has been published.Dr Tony Sewell, a former Government advisor and chief executive of the charity Generating Genius, said: “With this link between the schools and the particular colleges, you indirectly create a kind of club.  “We still have a system where independent schools know the system and the back doors. They flood top colleges with applications, they know which ones to apply to and they also know the subject areas.Oxford’s New College has made 11 offers to Eton and seven to Winchester pupils since 2017.  The college is a member of historic relationship - known as the Amicabilis Concordia - with the two schools, which dates back to 1452.As part of this, representatives of New College are invited to formal functions at Eton, and the £41,700-a-year Winchester College has two of its fellows elected by New College. Cambridge\u0027s Peterhouse College made three offers over three years to pupils from Wincheser College. The College’s director of studies for history is a governor at the school.  Oxford said they are proud of their outreach work and are committed to “doing what it takes” to become more erseMary Curnock-Cook, the former head of the university admissions service Ucas, said: “I’ve always had a high level of confidence in the underlying fairness of Oxbridge admissions, but the optics of this are frankly terrible.   “It undermines the positive steps that both universities have taken recently to improve the ersity of their student body.”  James Turner, chief executive of the social mobility charity The Sutton Trust said the figures reveal “how much more work there is to do to make sure a bright child can get into Oxbridge no matter where they come from.  “If there are things at play which are not in the open, or could put students not from those schools at a disadvantage, then of course that is a concern.”   Angela Rayner MP, the Shadow Secretary for education, said the figures show how the system entrenches inequality and that top universities are too often dominated by a tiny, privileged minority at the expense of the many.Dr. Rohan Agarwal who runs UniAdmissions, a tutoring agency that boasts of tripling students’ chances of getting into Oxbridge, said that there “absolutely” are links between certain schools and Colleges.Teachers at prestigious schools sometimes write to Oxbridge dons to recommend certain pupils, he said, adding: “What you have to worry about is teachers at a leading private school having dinner with the head of admissions at a college and mentioning a student.”Barnaby Lenon , chair of the Independent Schools Council and former headmaster of Harrow, said the formal links between colleges and schools combined with the offers data “doesn’t look great,” but denied that private schools were getting special treatment.    “That very small number of schools who get large numbers in do have a bit of an advantage because they collect all that data, they have all those alumni,” he said. “I speak to college admissions tutors and there is absolutely no sense in which any of these colleges are out to favour any particular school.”   Oxford and Cambridge said that any academics who sit on school governing bodies do so in a “personal capacity”, adding that there are rules in place to prevent any conflict of interest when it comes to pupil admissions from schools they are associated with.   Cambridge said in the university as a whole, over two-thirds of its students were from state schools and a quarter were from disadvantaged backgrounds. Oxford said they are proud of their outreach work and are committed to “doing what it takes” to become more erse. A spokesman for the Headmasters\u0027 and Headmistresses\u0027 Conference, which represents the country\u0027s leading private schools including Eton, Winchester and Westminster, said it is not surprising that academically selective schools have large numbers of highly able students. He added: It would be surprising if they did not have large numbers going to Oxbridge, and of course if students know of particular colleges, these may be more popular. The numbers quoted are not particularly surprising for big, highly selective schools.Iran plane crash: British ambassador says his detention was \u0026#39of course illegal\u0026#39 in first statement since arrestComment: The Conservatives are not losing control of public spending, they\u0026#39re simply taking advantage of cheap moneyStiff upper lip means war babies will not seek  help for depression Comment: Life as the \u0026#39spare\u0026#39 younger Royal sibling isn\u0026#39t much funShopping ethically adds almost £500 to annual shopping bill, research findsVegetables grown without soil for first time using nutrient root sprayRevealed: The schools which send the highest number of pupils to every Oxbridge collegeExercise books are \u0026#39old fashioned\u0026#39 and paperless schools are the future,  leading headmistress saysRoyal Navy in daring mission to deliver beer to thirsty Australians stranded by bushfiresUS set to expel more than a dozen Saudi military trainees following terror attack in FloridaAustralia bushfires: Scott Morrison admits regret over his response to fires and promises inquiryRobert Abela wins election to be prime minister of Malta and calls for unity after Joseph Muscat\u0026#39s resignation over journalist\u0026#39s murderReynhard Sinaga: Mother of Britain\u0026#39s most prolific rapist says he is still \u0026#39my baby\u0026#39Britain must be ready to fight wars without US help, says defence secretaryBritish ambassador to Iran arrested and held for several hours in Tehran after attending vigilSir David Lidington and Sir Patrick McLoughlin among 10 new Tory peers to be created by end of monthConservative donors will fund new grassroots organisations to help Tory MPs who won general election seatsSussex Royal foundation expected to launch in April as couple face stumbling block over Hollywood celebrity donations Comment: It is time for Iran to come to the negotiating tableUS delegation flies to UK in last-ditch bid to stop HuaweiWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/12/30/TELEMMGLPICT000209395667_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNJjoeBT78QIaYdkJdEY4ClFGGjcI28awSNtOPAVs6pc.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"revealed schools send highest number pupils every oxbridge college","story":"The data reveals the success of a handful of grammar schools and highly selective state sixth form collegesUp and down the country, schools boast about their strong track record on getting high numbers of pupils into Oxford and Cambridge. But with both universities under pressure to admit more students from disadvantaged backgrounds, which schools are actually getting the most offers?The  has obtained data, under the Freedom of Information Act, from every single Oxford and Cambridge college on the schools which they have made the highest number of offers to from 2017 to 2019.

At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra’, says Will KirbyOut-and-out epiphanies are rare occurrences, but as I stood with my face deeply embedded in the armpit of a complete stranger in the early hours of the morning for the third time that week, I had the strangest feeling that I was, in fact, done with commuting on the Tube.There were other signs of course – like being kneecapped by the men in suits desperate to get onto the train before anyone has got off, or the passive-aggressive call to ‘move down please!’ at every stop as I consider how I could possibly make all 6ft of myself any smaller to allow for more space, or the unrecognisable smells that could honestly be anything from last night’s takeaway to this morning’s missed shower, or being late because of another series of red signals, or the 37 suitcases I had to negotiate because someone’s decided to move house, or looking at my bank balance and realising these joys are costing me more than £40 a week. I don’t know. But whatever it was, I realised then and there that I needed to find another way to get to work.\u0026nbspSo I did some investigating. A commute can make or break your day so it’s important to get it right. Walking was an option (healthy, free) but would have taken almost two hours each way, which would mean spending more than 12 hours a day either going from, to, or being at the office. I could jog, but, sadly, I hate jogging. The bus is doable, and a cheaper option than the Tube, but would involve three separate buses that aren’t very reliable. Which leaves me with one option. The bike.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeven things no-one tells you when you start cycling to workInitially I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to join the fluorescent, Lyrca-clad hordes that zoom around the capital at breakneck speeds. I’d never really ridden a road bike before, let alone had an argument with a car or a bus about who’s on whose side of the road. How was I going to fit in if I’d never even owned a pair of mirrored sunglasses and didn’t really know what Strava was?! But it didn’t take long to realise that there are some massive benefits that outweigh any nerves or doubts about taking to the road on two wheels.Firstly, it’s healthy. Even a short cycle at the start and end of the day is exercise you probably wouldn’t otherwise have done, and it makes so much more sense to combine your fitness with your commute rather than trying to carve a slice out of your day to go to the gym. It also makes you feel good – if you take a look around the office first thing in the morning, it’s easy to spot the bright faces who’ve biked into work in amongst those who spent at least part of their morning under the ground.\u0026nbspIt is also better for the environment. Public transport, for its many faults (see above), is certainly greener than driving myself to work every morning, but there’s only so long you can tell yourself it doesn’t have a carbon footprint. Transport for London uses more electricity than anything else in the city, consuming enough power to fuel around 360,000 homes each year. By ditching my Oyster, I can hopefully shed with it that last ounce of green guilt.\u0026nbspWhy I\u0027ve pledged to go flight-free for a yearWhy I\u0027m going vegan for 2020This year I pledge to buy local and eat with the seasonsAnd I may as well do what I can to reduce pollution in the city where I live, even if it is on an inidual scale. A recent study found the capital’s poor air quality leads to around 1,000 hospital admissions for asthma and serious lung conditions every year, and another revealed that around four Londoners are hospitalised every day due to asthma caused by air pollution. Breathing London air is like smoking 160 cigarettes a year, according to the British Heart Foundation, and when you then consider that pollution on the Tube is around 15 times worse than above ground, it’s got to be a good idea to spend as little time down there as you can.\u0026nbspThe combination of a bit of light exercise and avoiding the toxic fumes that swirl around beneath the capital also reduces the chance of a heart attack and other cardiovascular diseases. In fact, if the same number of trips were made by bike as they are in Denmark (26 per cent of all trips that are less than 5km), it could save the NHS a staggering £17 billion within 20 years.So, I’m going to give it a go. At best, I’ll get fit, rediscover a long-lost hobby and do my bit to tackle the growing climate crisis. At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra. I’ll keep you posted.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

How did things get so bad in my kitchen?’ asks food writer Julia Platt LeonardI avoid cleaning my refrigerator like other people put off doing their taxes. I wait until it’s a sea of plastic containers, cling-film-wrapped onion halves, teetering jars – until I can’t find the mayonnaise or remember where the parmesan cheese is. Only then, when I can’t fit another thing inside, do I take it all out.\u0026nbspI throw out the piece of salmon skin I was going to give to the dogs. I toss out something spore-covered (carrots? meatballs?) and another item I think used to be a solid but is now liquid. Judging by the amount of mould, you’d think I was starting up a penicillin laboratory.And each time I chuck out an uneaten leftover or a floppy cucumber I feel ashamed – ashamed at the waste. As a food writer, I know better.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, about one third of the food produced in the world – a whopping 1.3 billion tonnes – is wasted or lost. In richer countries we waste as much food as sub-Saharan Africa produces. I’ve interviewed farmers, written about food policy and yet I’m part of the problem.I see myself standing before a food waste deity (picture Greta Thunberg with a white beard) and am forced to look at the piles of food I’ve wasted. It’s not a pretty picture. How did things get so bad in my kitchen?Why I’ve decided to start cycling to workI went to cooking school and worked in professional kitchens so FIFO – “first-in, first-out” – was my mantra. Food came in and we prepared and served it to ensure that waste was kept to a minimum. We labelled containers and made prep lists so nothing was missed. The walk-in fridge was kept clean, for hygiene reasons of course, but also so we knew what we had and ordered accordingly. My fridge? A disaster zone.I wasn’t raised to waste. My maternal grandparents came from western Kentucky, got married during the depression, and would no sooner have wasted a morsel of food than they would have walked down the street naked. When things were really tight, my grandmother reused coffee grounds and gave cucina povera a decidedly southern twist. My mother was the same, serving a meal one night, leftovers the next, and if necessary ‘must-go’ servings on the third.Food that’s not eaten either goes down the drain, is incinerated or ends up on a landfill where greenhouse gases are generated. That’s waste. But it’s also a waste because land, water, labour and energy were spent to create the food I binned. It’s also food that could have fed other people.My food waste, whether it’s the mystery container wedged in the back of the fridge or the past-sell-by date beans on my cupboard shelves, must stop. That’s why I’ve committed to reducing my food waste in 2020.Why I\u0027m making my home more eco-friendlyThat means getting a handle on what comes in my kitchen and what goes back out. It also means taking a critical look at the food choices I’m making. If I want my kitchen to be more sustainable then it’s time to ask some tough questions. Where do the foods I eat come from? What impact do they make on the earth? Can I justify eating avocados or pouring almond milk on my cereal? And the elephant – scratch that, cow – in the room, can I be an ethical omnivore?I’m going to learn more about food labelling to find out what it tells us, and what it doesn’t. I’ll figure out how to cut down on plastic in my kitchen and waste in my cooking. I’ll embrace my leftovers and think before I buy.I’ll make my kitchen and my cooking more sustainable in 2020, one meal at a time.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter.

People stood like sheep in the rain, cold and sleet for up to four hours to see the chilling film about a 12-year-old girl going to the devil,” wrote the article’s author, Judy Klemeswurd.“They lighted bonfires at their waiting post on Second Avenue, between 59th and 60th Streets, to keep warm.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.37 horror films that are genuinely scary Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.537 The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920)1237 The House of the Devil (2009)1937 Night of the Living Dead (1968)that bath scene – it\u0027s the smaller moments that make Kubrick\u0027s 1980 adaptation of Stephen King\u0027s The Shining a terrifying watch, notably the trippy final act that sees Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) lose his mind to the Overlook Hotel.537 The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920)1237 The House of the Devil (2009)1937 Night of the Living Dead (1968)that bath scene – it\u0027s the smaller moments that make Kubrick\u0027s 1980 adaptation of Stephen King\u0027s The Shining a terrifying watch, notably the trippy final act that sees Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) lose his mind to the Overlook Hotel.Security guards at the theatre recall being bribed by people wanting to skip the queues. Scalpers received upwards of $50 for a pair of tickets – an equivalent of almost $300 today given inflation.So desperate were people to see The Exorcist that a “riot” ensued at one cinema when “it looked like they weren’t going to make it inside after a four-hour wait”.\u0026nbspKlemeswurd remembers “the stale odour of vomit” in the cinema when describing the immediate reactions of moviegoers watching the film for the first time.\u0026nbspVomiting, fainting, nausea, trembling... the list reads like a list of possible side effects on a label for medication. The article also reports the occurrence of heart attacks and even a miscarriage.\u0026nbspThe graphic portrayal of Regan\u0027s demonic possession is indelible, the likes of which hadn\u0027t been seen before in mainstream cinema. Scenes in which the little girl spider-walks down the stairs, spins her head 360 degrees, and projectile vomits a\u0026nbspclumpy green substance (filmmakers used pea soup) are undoubtedly some of cinema’s most iconic and memorable moments.Screenings of the R-rated movie were packed long after it premiered on 26 December 1973, despite the mixed reviews it received.\u0026nbsp19 films to look out for in 202037 horror films that will actually scare youAlthough The Exorcist was seminal for the horror genre and shattered box-office records, The Exorcist was met with criticism from a number of high-profile critics, including those from The New Yorker, The Times and Newsweek.\u0026nbspPeople were as disgusted with The Exorcist’s explicit visuals as they were captivated by them, particularly those who had read Blatty’s book on which the film was based.“I wanted to see how the girl’s face becomes contorted and how she emits a foul odour from her mouth and I want so see how they show her masturbating with a crucifix. I can’t really believe they could really show that,” said one 22-year-old viewer.\u0026nbsp“There’s a little bit of morbid curiosity in all of us,” said another moviegoer on the film\u0027s overwhelming popularity.In 1974 The Exorcist became the first horror movie to receive an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, among 10 other nominations including Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Actress.Although it did not win the coveted Best Picture accolade, Blatty’s disturbing tale has had an undeniable influence on horror in cinema, and continues to scare viewers long after the film\u0027s special effects went out of date.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I check my EU settlement status online numerous times every day because I am so nervous and insecure from waiting.”Partners of EU nationals waiting months for post-Brexit statusNine out of 10 EU settlement scheme appeals successful, data showsWhy the EU settlement scheme isn’t as smooth as the Home Office claimsChristopher Desira, solicitor at the law firm Seraphus and at the European Commission Representation in the UK, said he had seen multiple cases of people being wrongly refused employment and turned away by landlords while they wait for a response on their settlement applications on the basis that they hadn’t yet got settled status.He told of one case where the non-EU citizen married to an EU national got a job offer, but was told by the employer that he was not able to work until he was granted settled or pre-settled status. It took three months for his application to be concluded, during which he was unable to earn a living.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They are being left in a state of temporary limbo,” said Mr Desira.“In an ideal world, the employer will understand that freedom of movement applies until the end of this year, but because of all the uncertainty and confusion around Brexit, that employer may not understand any of this. And they don’t want to take the risk, so they insist on asking to see pre-settled status or settled status when they should not do so. Those affected could take them to court, but this is a costly and long-winded process, so most choose to try to find another job.Partners of EU nationals waiting months for post-Brexit status“The Home Office are educating everyone, but whatever communication they’re doing for this now, it is not enough. We’ve seen multiple cases, and there will be more because we know there is underreporting on this.”Luke Piper, legal adviser to the3million, which campaigns for the rights of EU citizens in Britain, said he had seen a number of people who had been refused promotions because of their pending applications, but added that while it was “arguably unlawful” for employers to do this, the issue was only likely to grow.He pointed out that the “certificate of application” – which is issued to people once they have applied under the EU settlement scheme and is supposed to prove their right to live, work and study in the UK for six months – was not being recognised by employers.“In the real world, do you think employers are going to employ someone who essentially has six months to remain in the UK with the potential for a grant of pre-settled status of settled status?” he said.The comments came after the latest EU settlement scheme figures published by the Home Office showed that 525,200 applicants – more than one in five – were still waiting for an outcome, fuelling fears that a backlog is building up ahead of Brexit.The Home Office said it typically takes five working days to process a completed application through the settlement scheme and thousands are handled every day.A spokesperson added: “EU citizens are our friends, family and neighbours and we want them to stay, and so far more than 2.5 million people have been granted status through the EU settlement scheme. EU, EEA and Swiss citizens can continue to demonstrate their rights with a passport or ID card until 2021.“Employers and landlords have a duty not to discriminate against people unlawfully.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

First, Corbyn’s unpopularity means that his policy positions become ‘toxified’ simply by name association.“With Corbyn’s net satisfaction ratings continuing to plummet to new lows, voters who are less aware of policy specifics may say the party needs to change direction due to their dislike for the Labour leader, despite actually agreeing with many of his manifesto commitments.“Secondly, it is also worth pointing out that policies when being polled on an inidual basis can be popular, but when taken together as part of a broader platform, voters take a different view or have a different impression as their cumulative appeal.”BMG questioned 1,508 British adults between 8 and 10 January.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I don’t consider myself a subject, I think I’m a citizen of this country and I think the vast majority of people consider themselves citizens.”Phillips, Nandy and Long Bailey pass first Labour leadership hurdleThe suggestion comes after a torrid few weeks for the royal family, during which Prince Andrew was forced to step back from public duties over his relationship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026nbspcaused shock waves by announcing they were abandoning most of their royal duties.Mr Lewis said: “As regards to the royal family,\u0026nbspI completely respect the right of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026nbspto do what they’ve done – it’s a matter for them.“I think it’s extremely unfortunate and a sign of the media we have that they feel they have to do this. If you look at the intrusion on their lives, if you look at the racism that Meghan Markle\u0026nbsphas experienced in the British media then I can understand why given what’s happened.”However, he later clarified his comments about the monarchy, insisting he had not called for the royal family to be abolished.He tweeted: “In response to my comments about the royal family. I didn’t say they should be abolished, I have lots of respect for the hard work they do. I simply think the question about their size and the money they receive should be one for the public.

At least Greta follows through on what shes saying.So its understandable that most Brits would feel a little confused by the couples actions and lash out against their hypocrisy.But to say this is because Meghan is mixed race is totally ridiculous.In  Meghan was welcomed into the royal family with open arms by the Queen, with royal commentator Duncan Larcombe telling The Sun that Her Majesty made an  “unusual effort” with her grandsons we as she didnt want her to feel alienated.The Queens approval of Meghan and Harrys wedding spoke volumes, signying how the reigning monarch was moving with the times by allowing a orcee to marry into the establishment - something she was unable to do for her own sister, Princess Margaret.Meghans African-American heritage did not factor into the Queens decision to allow them to marry - and nor should it now be considered as a reason behind the Sussexes radical departure.Its estimated that almost  million Brits tuned in to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle say I do - a national gesture that said: We support you.If Meghan and Harry are indeed attempting to flee racism, then North America is hardly the ideal place to go - when Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, was not long ago outed for blacking up, just a day after admitting such behaviour was racist. The hypocrisy is embarrassing.And is the US really any better  President Trump has repeatedly claimed that hes the least racist person that youve ever encountered and yet he thinks it is acceptable to propose a ban on all Muslims entering the US and call Mexican immigrants criminals and rapists...Equally, Hollywood is the home of #metoo and #oscarssowhite - hardly a perfect model of racial justice and equality.But now as a huge eff off to the Queen, Meghan and Harry have formed deeper ides than ever before by choosing to orce from the family that made them the most famous couple in the world.The relentless scrutiny the royals come under is undoubtedly a heavy burden - and its not hard to be sympathetic to the Sussexes plight.However, this doesnt take away from the fact that an evident lack of gratitude has been shown towards the Queen in the past  hours.In going behind Her Majestys back and springing this announcement on her without warning - the Sussexes deserve to be criticised.All members of the royal family have come under fire at some point or other - even six year old Prince George, who was cruelly mocked for taking ballet classes by a US TV host.But it seems thatthe same thing happens to our dear duchess, we must hold our tongues.A persons race doesnt excuse disgraceful behaviour andanyone is going to call the royals up on it, its going to be the public.The currents have turned against Meghan for many reasons, but not because the nation is suddenly racist.The royal couple say they will be financially independent as they carve out a progressive new role.But given that we will more than likely be shelling out millions into the Sussexes relocation to Canada with round-the-clock security teams, a royal entourage and staff members - we should at least be able have the chance to freely voice our critiques without having to worry about being branded racist as a consequence.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Harry may find out William feels the same.Although at present it seems unlikely, Harry could be stripped of the “His Royal Highness” tag on the basis that he no longer represents the family.AndHollywood grabbed the chance to put a newly free Meghan on the big screen — one of her unachieved big ambitions — the House of Windsor would be wise to quickly withdraw her HRH tag before further damage is done.It requires no Act of Parliament to do this, just a nod from the Queen. And with a hugely disgruntled William and Charles prompting her, it could just happen.Then there’s the question of baby Archie.

He wants to show voters that the country has moved on and the Government is once more focusing on the domestic issues voters care about.But however much he tries, it will be hard to make these talks boring. They are important and there is already DRAMA BREWING.Boris saw the new Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Downing Street this week. The pair got on well in their hour-long meeting. They both want these talks to be less acrimonious than the orce negotiations both want a more cordial tone.The pair reminisced about the school they had both attended in Brussels. Unlike Eton, it didn’t have playing fields, and until Johnson arrived the only game in the playground was marbles. He introduced some more rough and tumble.No were pleased that von der Leyen, rather than the more confrontational Michel Barnier, took the lead. As one No source points out, the EU loathed the lack of clarity and authority under Theresa May: She wasn’t clear what she wanted and it wasn’t certain that she could deliver what she wanted.With Boris and his new majority it is very dferent. He was able to point von der Leyen to the Tory manesto’s commitments on the future trade deal and say this was his mandate and that he was determined to deliver it.Yet despite the pair’s attempt to maintain a friendly tone, there are already tensions. Boris is irritated that the EU keeps saying it is nigh-on impossible to negotiate a full trade deal by December , despite having signed up to a political declaration that commits it to trying to do just that.The DANGER is that the EU thinks that under time pressure Boris will bend, that he will either extend the transition period — something he has repeatedly promised not to do — or drop his commitment to breaking away from EU rules and regulations.Boris is determined not to do either of these things. He doesn’t want to extend and believes in the value of the UK having the right to do things dferently.Both sides have frequently misunderstood each other in this process. Both sides must now realise that the other means what it says. Unless they do, there is going to be an almighty bust-up and no trade deal at the end of all this.THERE will be a National Security Council meeting later this month to decide whether or not to allow the Chinese company Huawei to be involved in the construction of the UK’s G network.This is an issue of fierce debate in Whitehall. Under Theresa May, it led to the then Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson’s sacking from government.Hawkish figures inside government fear No is leaning towards allowing Huawei’s involvement. One complains that Downing Street’s timetable for the technology’s roll-out is, “not realistic”, but that this time pressure means it will need Huawei involved. However, I understand that the Americans are pushing very hard for the UK to bar Huawei.One senior US government national security figure has been in London this week to lobby directly on this point.Before he makes a decision on Huawei, Boris Johnson should consider the damage it could do to Britain’s most important security relationship – the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing agreement with Australia, Canada, the US and New Zealand.Eventhe UK thinks it can manage Huawei’s involvement,our allies do not then we shouldn’t proceed. It is simply not worth the risk of undermining such a vital alliance.Don’t expect his approach to change. His holidays will be far more glam than Cameron and May’s were.THE most common reason British governments fail is that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor fall out.If No and the Treasury – the most powerful department in government – aren’t on the same page, nothing gets done.Boris Johnson and Sajid Javid are determined to avoid this fate. In the run-up to the Budget on March , there will be a huge effort to make sure that the Treasury and No work together.One Johnson ally tells me the two men will have a Budget-focused meeting at the start of each week to make sure they are in agreement on the key issues.Then their teams will meet again mid-week to assess progress. Javid, whose job is safe in the coming reshuffle, is determined to show that the Treasury is capable of delivering on Boris Johnson’s agenda of levelling up across the country.Those close to him are confident that they can put meat on the bones of No’s plan.AT Cabinet this week it was impressed on ministers that one of the most important events this year is COP, the climate change conference the UK is hosting in Glasgow in November.The UK Government wants to use the event to show how Britain can lead on clean growth post-Brexit.I understand there will be a steady drum beat of announcements on this front throughout the year: The Tories want to show they are helping create new green-collar jobs.They also hope that by holding the event in Scotland, they can emphasise the benefits of the Union.THE Labour leadership contest has yet to catch fire.The Tories are not particularly concerned about any of the candidates.Though there is some hesitation about how they would handle PMQs with Jess Phillips, who likes to make very personal attacks on Boris Johnson.But the most interesting candidate in the race is Lisa Nandy.She seems to have the clearest understanding of why Labour lost.Her bid is starting to have faint echoes of David Cameron’s successful tilt at the Tory leadership in .GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is an appalling act and part of a whole pattern of appalling acts all across the region.Theres no excuse for shooting down an airliner, theres no excuse for a targeted assassination by one state against another.All this does is set off a spiral of violence and danger which will lead us to yet more wars in the future.The Boeing  flight came down on Tuesday in the outskirts of Tehran, hours after Iran launched a barrage of rockets against US targets in Iraq in response to the assassination of Soleimani.And now, after repeated denials, Irans President Hassan Rouhani has admitted his forces gunned down the civilian aircraft because they mistook it for an American fighter plane.In a statement, he brazenly blamed the aggressive US for the catastrophic mistake which killed  people.Irans acknowledgement of responsibility for the crash is likely to inflame public sentiment against authorities following Soleimanis killing last week.The general, who Donald Trump dubbed the worlds top terrorist, was killed days after Iran-backed militias attacked the US embassy in Iraqi capital Baghdad.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Who the hell is he to threaten us  He must order many coffins for his soldiers before making any threats.“Anyone can light the match but it will be us who will end the war and the losers in that war will be the Americans.”However, in spite of fiery rhetoric from both sides, things appear to be de-escalating as fears of World War  have been spiking on social media and Google all month.Hajizadeh previously broadcast footage of the largest underground base on Iranian TV.The entrance to Code , which lies in Khojir, Tehran, is hidden under a number of narrow winding roads, which run across mountainsides in the province.Hajizadeh previously said: “If enemies make a mistake, missile bases will erupt like a volcano from the depth of earth.”Pictures show the underground military base constructed with reinforced concrete and packed with rockets.Its located deep below ground — presumably designed to evade bunker-busting bombs.Iranian TV footage shows a number of missile components appearing to belong to the Qiam- ballistic missile system, which has a range of about  miles.The regime’s henchmen are then seen assembling them in one of the underground base’s launch rooms.Once fitted together, the missile is launched and is seen soaring skywards.Code  is said to be the site for the construction of Irans renowned Shahab  medium-range missiles.The Shahab, known as the Shooting Star can launch explosive chemical warheads of up to  miles, according to reports.It has been claimed Iranian officials purchased the missiles from North Korea, who constructed the weapon solely to blast the United States from the Korean Peninsula.The Lar garrison base lies in Western Iran, which also has an entrance that disappears into the mountainside, the Star on Sunday reported.NCRI sources told the newspaper it is a sprawling tunnel complex that is highly protected and secure.In a bid to maintain the tightest security, mobile phone signals are reportedly blocked off for miles surrounding it.The Queshm Missile Centre lies on the Iranian coast, understood to be hidden under around five layers of concrete."},{"url":null,"title":"schoolboy nasa intern discovers planet","story":"Wolf Cukier, , spotted it while gazing at satellite images of two stars, when their brightness briefly dipped.The high school student then noticed something moving in front of them — only to realise it was a planet , light years away.He flagged it up to his bosses while working in June, and they soon confirmed his discovery.The planet — which is around the same size as Saturn — has been named TOI  b.It was the first time the satellite had seen a planetary system with two stars.New Yorker Wolf, who was an intern at a Nasa space centre in Maryland, said: “It was like, oh… there’s something here.

And what a waste of their chance to play a key role in helping our Royal Family prosper after the Queen is gone.And what a waste of Harry and Meghan’s unique chance to be a living, inspirational representation of the multiracial country in which we now live. How quickly the shine has come off the golden couple.Less than two years after that wedding day, Harry and Meghan are scurrying off to an ill-defined “progressive” new le in Canada.Butthey have been unhappy with their royal roles, they have brought it on themselves. This much-loved couple have always been too thin-skinned for their own good.They have always been hysterically touchy when justied criticism came their way, such as when they lectured about climate change while reclining on private jets.The criticism was nothing personal. Hollywood stars get called out for climate hypocrisy. Do Harry and Meghan really imagine we will just tug our forelocks as they fly around the world in private jets while talking like Greta Thunberg in a tiara Harry and Meghan are never satisfied with anything less than unconditional deference. They apparently loathe royal le, yet demand to be treated like royalty.They have demonstrated an epic sense of entitlement, such as asking the taxpayer to pick up the £.million builder’s bill for doing up their home, Frogmore Cottage.Their great self-pitying delusion is that the wicked British media has it in for them. But it is not the media that caused Meghan so much excruciating embarrassment.It is largely her own dysal family and their indiscreetly flapping cakeholes, especially her dear old discarded dad Thomas Markle and her loony half-sister Samantha. Harry and Meghan’s self-pity is astounding.“Never complain, never explain,” has been the motto of the modern Royal Family. It has worked rather well.But place Harry and Meghan in front of a sympathetic camera crew, such as when ITV’s Tom Bradby trailed them on their tour of South Africa, and they can’t stop whining. Even when surrounded by victims of rape and landmines, they managed to feel sorry for themselves.“Not many people askedI’m OK,” Meghan complained in the Third World. There has not been a royal couple with such a staggering lack of self-awareness since Marie Antoinette and King Louis XVI of France. And look what happened to them.Harry and Meghan owe their mega-celebrity totally to their connection with the Royal Family. Their superstardom has nothing to do with Meghan’s acting career. Their lives of unimaginable luxury are funded in large part by the British taxpayer.The average couple spends just under £, on their wedding. Harry and Meghan were said to have blown £MILLION. Yet they do not appear to have a grateful bone between them. They seem incapable of counting their multiple blessings.Even now, after handing in their royal resignation, they give every indication that they want all the privileges of royal le with none of the obligations. They want to have their Eton mess and eat it.Harry and Meghan’s security alone currently costs around £, a year, paid for by the politan Police — which means paid for by the British taxpayer. Get the Mounties to start paying for it.And can we finally nail the great lie that Meghan has been persecuted in the UK because of her mixed race  When she first appeared, Meghan was a hurricane of fresh air. The British looked at her and it was love at first sight.This weary, ided, Brexit-battered nation was delighted to have an injection of Hollywood glamour. And millions of Brits now live in mixed-race families. There was real delight to see the Royal Family catching up with the rest of us.Among those crowds at Windsor on their wedding day I saw families of every race and creed under the sun who were ecstatic to see the Royal Family becoming less white, more inclusive, more representative.Harry and Meghan have drawn criticism because of their total lack of self-awareness. Both of them are independently rich. Harry is worth around £million after inheritances from his mother and the Queen Mum.Prince Charles gives him £million every year. Meghan made around £million from her role in long-runningTV legal drama Suits.Yet this fabulously wealthy couple have been happy to let others — the British taxpayer, Prince Charles, the Queen — pay their way in their gilded world.Six weeks, which is theof time that Harry and Meghan have just spent in Canada, is a very long time to be away from home.Unless, of course, “home” doesn’t feel like home because you feel criticised for everything you do and wear, your family – on both sides – are a nightmare and you are constantly judgedby people who have never met you and never will.I should imagine that in this case, Canada seems like a very good place to call home. So, who can blame Meghan and Harry for deciding to leave the UK behind to get away from it all, and maybe staying away from here in the long-term I have a lot of respect for the couple for ploughing their own furrow and walking their own path.Honestly, I couldn’t be happier for Harry, who has experienced so much sadness, that he has met a woman brave enough to suggest doing things a bit dferently.Although they are currently making bold statements about giving up the taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant, they show no sign of being willing to pay for their own security, or their own flunkies, or offer the taxpayer a rebate on those reported £million nuptials.There has never been even the slightest hint of gratitude. There has never been any indication that they — this rich, pampered couple with a beautul baby boy who will never want for anything — realise how lucky they are.So Harry and Meghan are not the only ones with mixed emotions today. There is real resentment that Harry and Meghan have caused distress to our Queen and it will not be easily forgotten or forgiven.The Queen has a -year-old husband who has recently been in hospital. She has a son mired in a squalid sex scandal. And she is  years old. Who the hell do Harry and Meghan think they are This feels like an abdication with a taxpayer-funded safety net. The couple plan to “step back as senior members of the Royal Family” but show no inclination to give up the privileges and pay days that come with the job.They say they want to “work to become financially independent”. But between them they are currently worth around £million. Why not pay their own way NOW Are they really suggesting that they turn their backs on this nation while asking it to foot their bills  It looks like it. The British taxpayer will continue to stump up for their phenomenal security bills. Harry’s daddy will cough up for much .So you can’t help wondering how intelligent they really are, this TV soap actress and a man who left Eton with two A-levels— a school where my dog could get four A-levels.Do Harry and Meghan really think they have had a raw deal  Are they that stupid  There is no republican movement in this country.The Queen has reigned far too well for far too long —  years on the throne next month — for anti-monarchy sentiment to develop.The Queen has spent her entire le placing public duty above private happiness.She has been the stable, stoic centre of this nation for so long that she has single-handedly made losing our monarchy unthinkable.Yet when a spokesman for anti-monarchy pressure group Republic demanded Harry and Meghan make a clean break, I found myself nodding in agreement with every withering word.“Theyhave said that they will dip in and out of royal duties as it suits them but won’t stop taking money until they find other sources of income,” said Republic’s Graham Smith.“To suggest they’re not already financially independent is incredibly crass and belies a sense of entitlement and lack of self-awareness common among royals.”This republican is right. If Harry and Meghan want a new le hanging out with the Clooneys and striking deals with Apple, they should fund it themselves.As they say in North America, do it on your own dime. Give up the HRH titles. Stop leeching off your royal status.They will be a footnote in the story of our Royal Family, Meghan the Wallis Simpson of the st Century, Harry another Duke of Windsor who believed exile with his American orcee would make him happy.The Royal Family is not all about them.The Queen will be an impossible act to follow. But the photograph of Queen Elizabeth smiling proudly with the next three generations of future kings — Princes Charles, William and George — suggests our Royal Family will last for at least  years after Netflix has cancelled The Crown, evenone day Meghan gets to play herself.The succession is assured. Decent men will wear the crown. And Kate is great. But let history record that no royal couple was ever as adored as Harry and Meghan.It is astonishing — and unbelievably sad, perhaps even tragic — that millions of us will be happy to see the back of them.Astrological patterns repeat in families through generations, just as it is doing with Meghan and Harry.Edward VIII, who wed American orcee Wallis Simpson, put love before duty, and planted a karmic seed that is at the root of what is unfolding now. It can be likened to a virus that has been lurking in the Royal household and is now being re-activated by Harry and Meghan.So what comes next  Uranus, the planet of shock-waves, moves to confront the Sun in Aquarius on January  and forms a clash with the New Moon on the th.There is likely to be a stinging backlash as all the remaining senior family members have their roles shaken up.Meghan will create a power couple that flourishes by spring with a number of initiatives.

We would have done the same to protect British servicemen and women. In fact, as Britain’s Defence Secretary I did exactly that, with the full support of Prime Minister David Cameron.Let’s not forget that every country has the right to self-defence.Of course, nobody wants this crisis to escalate. Indeed Iran’s retaliation has been noticeably limited so far.But the chorus for “de-escalation” carries risks too. Iran has been attacking Western shipping, including capturing a British tanker. Iran has fired missiles at Saudi oil refineries.Iran continues to wage proxy wars in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. Through its militias, Iran continues to destabilise neighbouring Iraq.At some point, somebody had to draw the line. Qasem Soleimani was no hero or statesman. He directed terrorist attacks across the Middle East.Thousands of Syrians, Iraqis and Yemenis died as a result. Iranian dissidents, too, were brutally suppressed.The roadside bomb-making he sponsored killed many of our brave servicemen in Iraq. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson reminded us, he had the blood of our soldiers on his hands.Has Trump’s strike weakened the case for Western intervention  It is worth remembering our troops and those of the US are in Iraq at Iraq’s invitation.Since , we have helped lead an international coalition of more than  countries to support its fragile democracy and liberate that country from the terrorist death-cult of Daesh Isis.And thanks to precision strikes by the RAF and the training by the British Army of thousands of Iraqi troops, Daesh has lost the pernicious grip it once had.Defeating Daesh isn’t just a matter of helping a friend in need or of standing up for human rights. Mercully, we have stopped Yazidi women from being raped, prisoners being burnt alive, gay people being thrown off buildings and Western hostages sadistically executed.But tackling Daesh terrorism is also vital to protect our own way of le here in Western Europe.Islamist fundamentalism needs to be defeated, whether in Mosul, Raqqa, a Paris suburb or on London Bridge.So yes, let’s continue to work with our allies to persuade Iran’s revolutionaries to take a dferent path.Saudi Arabia, the other Gulf countries and even Russia all have roles to play in getting Iran back to the negotiating table.After the appalling shooting down of the Ukrainian airliner, let’s try to show the Iranian people their government needs to be more truthful and more open, that there is a better future beyond the mullahs and the republican guards.But diplomacy alone will not be enough. We have to protect our national interests too. Trump’s strike is a stark reminder that in the end, we must all stand up when those interests are threatened so directly.First, we must persuade other European navies to work with the US and our own Royal Navy in patrolling and protecting convoys through the Strait of Hormuz.This is a vital choke point for Europe’s trade and energy. The gas and oil we need this winter pass through it.It is ludicrous that some Nato allies won’t work with American ships for fear of upsetting the mullahs in Tehran.This has to be a US-led international operation.Second, we need a better nuclear agreement with Iran. It was right to try to halt their nuclear programme. But the previous deal wasn’t comprehensive — it didn’t even cover missiles — and it completely failed to constrain Iranian misbehaviour in the region. If anything, Iran used the access to new finance that deal released to step up its proxy wars in Yemen and where.A new deal should ensure full oversight of all Iran’s nuclear activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and only allow Iran back into the international markets when its civil nuclear programme is in complete compliance.Third, we have to step up our campaign against terrorism.Outside the EU after Brexit, we will still need to share intelligence and work together with our European partners to identy new attacks. But our closest ally in the battle to protect our values will always be the US. We may not always agree with Trump’s tactics but we shouldn’t ignore that he has finally cut through the illusion — Iran’s current regime is not our friend.Iran will certainly have learned a lesson from President Trump’s decisive action. But I hope we will do so too.Turning a blind eye to those who foster international terrorism is no longer an option for any of us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She askedthey wanted to join her in the “mile-high club”, then attacked cabin crew who refused her more alcohol.Demi Burton tried to headbutt and kick six crew members and passengers who tried to restrain her before she was arrested when the plane landed.In court, the -year-old claimed she had been drinking because she has a fear of flying and said this behaviour is out of character, which may be true.Her defence lawyer Martin Callery said: “She is thoroughly ashamed of herself . . .  and utterly embarrassed at the way she behaved.”But that is certainly not the impression she conveyed outside court, where she gleefully flicked obscene hand gestures at photographers.No doubt she stopped smiling when she heard she had been sentenced to six months in prison. Personally, I’m not sure how effective prison is. But the problem with reckless behaviour is that you have to face the consequences.And I really hope for Demi, this is the moment she gets her le back on track. We all make mistakes. It’s what we do afterwards that defines us.It would be easy to assume that Demi is a hopeless case. But she is young enough to turn her le around, to work hard, do better and see this rock-bottom moment as a catalyst for change.And then something good will come from what is a very low moment in her le. We don’t have to look far for examples of people who have overcome lapses or mistakes before going on to succeed.Take Robert Downey Jr, who went from drug addict to one of Hollywood’s highest-paid actors. Or Elton John and Robbie Williams, both of whom have overcome major drug issues before enjoying renewed stardom, fatherhood and, more importantly, a good le.While it is not the same as a drunken mistake, anyone who has made it in business will have a good few failures under their belt — whether it is a dodgy commercial decision, plain bad luck or a company that has gone bust.It is not what happens to us in le but what we do next that counts. So I am guessing that, from her cell, Demi might be reflecting on what she might do dferently when she gets out. Andshe isn’t, she should be.Because it is the getting back on the horse that counts, evenit means resisting the urge to go back to bed to hide. No one is perfect. No one gets through le without messing up or things going wrong.Before success, you will get temporary defeat or total failure. The key to getting through it is resilience. And one of the best gts you can give a child is to encourage them not to give up.By the way, I speak here from experience. Like any businesswoman, I’ve made some mistakes and had my fair share of knocks.There are some that I have managed to turn to my advantage and others that I have had to chalk up to experience.The key thing is that I have learned from what went wrong, then moved on. That experience has allowed me to create a mini-manesto on how to fail how to respond to setbacks and failure, which I’ll share here now:Give yourself time to recover and reflect. Force yourself to take small steps to get back on the horse. Do not accept failure. See it as a step on the journey towards success.Remember that challenging and dficult moments are what help you grow bigger or better. Without them, you would stay the same.The only people who haven’t experienced setbacks are people who are too scared to try. So “failure” is often a sign of bravery. Hold your head up high at all times.Try your best and be proud to do so, eventhings don’t always work out the way you want them to. Remind yourself: “Where there is a will, there’s a way.” And as they say, the best thing about the future is it comes one day at a time.ANOTHER new year, another month of looking at photos of scantily clad people on beaches in sunnier climes and asking myselfI am the only person who is not on the beach.This is the time of year for massive bikini-body and holiday FOMO.But let us all take heart that it is also, oh joy, the time of year for elasticated waists hidden under chunky knitwear.Personally, I am more than happy to swap the beach for nothing to shave and no stomach to suck in.

He also told them: “I am a master of bullying.”It sounds horric.I feel so sorry for his mum, who must be devastated that her little boy turned into a cruel bully as an adult.I dont do needles when it comes to my face.  Lasers, facials, peels . . .  sure. But needles are another story entirely.If you are willing to take the chance of injecting poison into your face, at the very least you want a predictable result. And in my experience, you don’t get it.Who wants eyebrows at the top of their head, lips that come into the room before you do, or a forehead that doesn’t move  Not me, that’s for sure. However . . .This week I read that not only is the gorgeous Abbey Clancy having micro-Botox injections, hyaluronic acid fillers and vitamins, she is doing it with TWENTY needles at once.Abbey, , is having something called an aquagold facial, so called because each needle is covered in -carat gold. The marketing blurb claims this treatment will reduce pores, blur out fine lines and leave your skin with a vibrant glow.Some might say this is a slippery slope to the stronger stuff but Abbey looks amazing.  So it has to be worth a try, don’t you think I HAD to laugh at the photos of the BBC newsreader whose dress, which had burst open minutes before going on air, was cobbled together from behind by quick-thinking colleagues.  Liz Beacon’s outfit was patched up with gaffer tape and bulldog clips.I used to believe what I saw on TV. But since filming The Apprentice, I know all too well that all is not necessarily what it seems.Two examples spring to mind. First, the countless times I have been filmed in the boardroom with a smart jacket on top and leggings or even pyjama bottoms and slippers under the boardroom table.Second, and worse, the time I somehow forgot to bring a bra on a day I was wearing a white blouse.Luckily, a kind crew member who is roughly the same size as me lent me hers.  And the show, as it always seems to do, went on.I WAS appalled to read about the private Islamic secondary school that has been “unlawfully segregating” boys and girls for all activities except weekly assemblies, according to a stinging Ofsted report.One of the teachers theretold pupils “university is not for females”, according to the report.

And he vowed: “What I would do is lead from the top and say it’s my responsibility to deal with it. I wouldn’t say it’s for ­somebody . I want the files. I want the numbers on my desk.”  Labour’s General Election campaign was derailed when Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis said Mr Corbyn was unfit for high office because of anti-Semitism and that a victory for Labour would put the “very soul of our nation” at stake.In its statement today, the Board of Deputies of British Jews calls on all ­contenders to sign up to its ten-point plan. It includes settling all outstanding anti-Semitism cases by a fixed deadline. Mr Corbyn’s aides have been ­accused of interfering in cases against members facing claims of anti-Semitism.  The Deputies say the new leader must ensure the ­internal disciplinary process is “independent”. They also call for awareness ­programmes. Prosecutors are considering charges against five people in the party over anti-Semitism. The issue re-emerged ahead of the close of nominations for the leader and deputy leader tomorrow.

He was mocked by Tory MPs and commentators but back at my home in Wigan people cheered him on. It showed a political system that is staggeringly out of touch with the things that matter. Nearly % of all public transport journeys are made by bus. In many parts of the country buses are the only public transport there is. But to listen to the Tories you’d think they don’t even exist. We pay too much for shockingly bad buses. Fares have gone up by a whopping % in a decade. And around , routes have been cancelled in that time. This week I had an email from a - year-old asking why the bus she needs to get to her nan’s house has been cancelled. She wrote: “Over the past few years I have had a lot to go through and going to my nan’s house has really boosted my confidence.” Now she can’t get there. Labour talked a lot about our rail policies at the last election but we should have been shouting louder about buses. A decade of austerity has forced cuts in bus services upon councils. This must end. Labour councils like Nottingham have produced very successful long-term plans for their bus network. All councils should have the power to take control of bus services so they set the fares and the routes.

The -year-old, who has autism and a learning disability, was delighted to land the role after finding it impossible to even find a volunteer position.

Fewer than five per cent of people with a learning disability have paid employment in the UK, yet more than  per cent want to work.

Best friends Robyn Jago, , and Elyse O’Donnell, from Merseyside, have described their terrying experience while on a dream trip. Their adventure took a devastating turn when a tyre on the car they were travelling in burst, causing it to lose control and veer off in the wrong direction, the Liverpool Echo reports. Elyse, who was driving the car at the time, tried to regain control but it soon hit a dip at the side of the road causing it to flip onto its roof and hit a nearby tree, which smashed straight through the windscreen. They escaped the car with severe injuries, including broken backs, and the emergency services were four hours away. Robyn from Halewood, and Elyse, from Stockbridge Village, travelled over to Perth together from Thailand, back in February . After securing jobs on a farm, the pair spent the following year working “in the middle of nowhere” in Broome and Hallscreek, in order to save up enough money to travel up the East coast. But on September , their trip took a devastating turn. Robyn said she first realised that something was wrong, when she smelt “burning rubber” coming from the tyres - but it was already too late. Ironically, Australian police told Robynshe had not had removed her seat-belt she would have been impaled by the tree.  Robyn told the Echo: “I woke up and I was on my hands and knees scrunched up in a ball. I donapost remember being in the air flipping. I just remember seeing a tiny glimpse out of the window which I knew wasnapost the road. I was trying to understand what had happened when I saw a light switch on the floor next to me and thataposs when I realised that it was actually the roof of the car and that we were upside down. Robyn and Elyse were in the car with two other women, who they had met the month before, but who have asked not to be named.  Seconds before the accident, Robyn had unfastened her seat belt in order to change position in the tightly packed car, meaning she took the full force of the crash. Robyn said: Your senses slowly start coming back to you and I heard screaming and Elyseaposs voice. “She had managed to get out of the car by this point withand they were stood on the side of the road. When I looked to my right I sawcovered in blood, I thought she was dead. She had blood all over her face and wounds where the tree had scraped her. I screamed.” Robyn said: “Elyse could hear a hissing noise coming from the car so she thought it was going to blow. “She was shouting ‘you need to get out of the car.”  By this point, Robyn said she knew she had broken her back but they had no other option but to get out of the car. She said: “I couldn’t get out of the side I was on so we had to get out of the other side but there was a branch coming through the window. “Elyse andhad to pull us both out in the end.” Robyn suffered from a bleed on the brain during the crash and was left with a broken back and a burst finger. Elyse broke her back and neck in five dferent places.  One of the other two women who was travelling in the car at the time of the crash sustained a total of  serious injuries including a wound to the head, while the other was left with black eye and a torn ligament to the shoulder. Robyn said: “I never take my seatbelt off, I literally just took it off for a minute to get comfortable. “But the police told me afterwards thatI had had my seat belt on there was a good chance I would have been impaled by the tree and would probably have been dead by now.” After managing to escape from the vehicle, the girls stood “shaking” as they tried to work out what to do next. Robyn said the crash took place literally in the middle of nowhere” and was a three and a half hour drive away from the nearest hospital. However, thanks to a lorry driver who was driving past shortly after the accident, the girls managed to get to the roadside to call for help. Robyn said: “We were far away from the road because of where the car landed butheard a lorry going past so she bombed it up to the side of the road.  She told him aposweaposve just been in a car crash’ and he grabbed his first aid kit, he was lovely.” There was a mining site not too far away so he called there and said ‘have you got first aiders to help in any way they can. Robyn said it took a total of four hours for an ambulance and police to arrive at the scene of the crash. The girls were then taken to the nearest clinic,  minutes away, to be assessed before Robyn was taken with one of the other women, by air ambulance to Broome Hospital. While Elyse and her other friend who was involved in the crash, were taken to Kunnuara Hospital the following day. Robyn said: “The first person Elyse told was her mum. She panicked at first because all Elyse did was cry down the phone but then once she told her everyone’s alive and she went really calm and calmed Elyse right down. “Elyse told my sister for me because I lost my phone in the crash. It was so surreal it honestly still doesn’t feel like it happened to us.”  Robyn spent the following eight days after the accident being treated in hospital before she was discharged over the course of a week, while Elyse spent the following nine days in hospital. Due to the severity of both of their injuries, they were fitted with neck braces and had to attend hospital appointments several times a week for the following three months. Robyn said: We were both in absolute agony. After we were discharged from hospital we spent the next three months mostly indoors at our friendaposs house. I had to go back to the hospital for constant checks. I was put on medication for my brain haemorrhage and memory games and brain training. We could walk but we spent a lot of time lying down because of the pain. We were tired all the time, we just had no energy. Since the accident, Robyn and Elyse have made a good progress with their injuries and had their back braces removed in December. Despite being able to walk now unsupported, Robyn said they are both unable toto work until at least March and suffer from a lot of pain which makes it a nightmare to sleep at night. Robyn said the psychological pain of the accident, has also been unbearable with both Elyse and herself regularly suffering from flash backs and night terrors. But due to the high cost of receiving physiotherapy for their injuries and counselling, the girls have been unable to get the help they desperately need. Robyn said: Itaposs taken a toll on our mental health. Iaposve had depression and anxiety before but itaposs been a whole new level since the accident. Weaposve had to sit indoors for three months watching our savings disappear while we recover. Weaposve both struggled to sleep since. We have sleep paralysis and suffer from nightly flashbacks. She added: Weaposre so scared of travelling in cars now. Weaposll be in a taxi and itaposll change lanes and we both get so nervous. Weaposre just very nervous about everything little thing. The doctor has told us weaposre not allowed to go back to work until March.

Headteacher Mrs Janine Parker took the decision after an incident in which he kicked and punched teaching staff, tipped over chairs and a table, and pulled displays off a wall. It was the culmination of a pattern of violent behaviour that began in nursery when he was just three. He hasnapost had another day in school since his exclusion, the Manchester Evening News reports. The week before Christmas, little Rudi was writing out cards for all his classmates. His parents Claire Scae and Carl Barnes had to take them in to school for him, but they fear Rudi is already being left behind. He went to a friendaposs birthday party and this kid said aposnobody remembers you in school apos, said Claire, . He got really upset, itaposs heartbreaking. While the parents understand why the school made the drastic decision, they are distraught and believe more should have been done to keep him in school and get him the help he clearly needs. The couple say they have no idea where Rudiaposs behaviour comes from and that it doesnapost happen at home.  Certainly, Rudiaposs exclusion is unusual. There were just  children permanently excluded aged five across the country in -, according to the Department for Education. In Manchester, only thirteen pupils in total were permanently excluded from state-funded primary schools. The advice to headteachers is that it should be an absolute last resort. However,  as the M.E.N has reported previously  , soaring rates of exclusions has been a serious problem in Manchester schools in recent years. A government review, led by former childrenaposs minister Edward Timpson and published last year, pointed to an array of negative outcomes for children who are excluded including a reduced likelihood of achieving good GCSEs, a higher chance of ending up unemployed and a higher chance of being either the victim, or perpetrator of a crime. In November , Manchester Council responded by launching a new aposInclusion Strategyapos that was designed to tackle exclusion rates. But the sad story of how Rudi Barnes came to be kicked out of school at such a young age, and his parentsapos ongoing battle to make sure he gets an education, highlights how this continues to be a challenging problem.Many of those tasked with preventing exclusions, from school staff to mental health services, are struggling with a rapidly increasing workload and dwindling budgets after a decade of government funding cuts. Four months after his permanent exclusion, Rudi still hasnapost had another day at school or been assessed by a mental health professional, despite being referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Servicesat least nine times, the M.E.N understands. By law, the local authority must make arrangements for a childaposs full time education from the sixth day of exclusion onwards. Rudi has been offered alternative provision at Bridgelea, a Pupil Referral Unit , for permanently excluded children but it has left the parents in a quandry. There used to be a Bridgelea site in Gorton, near to their home in Miles Platting, but that closed in . The main PRU site is in Withington, almost six miles away and several bus journeys away for Claire and Carl who do not have a car and are reliant on state benefits. Carl, , is a full-time carer to partner Claire who has diabetes, and is also responsible for getting Rudiaposs nine-year-old brother and two-year-old sister to school every day. The family borrowed a car to take Rudi for a day visit to Bridgelea and after meeting the headteacher, they believe the school can provide the support he needs. But the couple feel it is simply aposimpossibleapos for Carl to get the other children to school and also take Rudi to Bridgelea.  Carl and Claire were hoping Rudi could get funding from the council for transport from home to school but so far none has materialised. Manchester Council says Rudi has been provided with a bus pass for free travel and ultimately, there is no excuse for him not to be at Bridgelea. The authority has now threatened to prosecute Carl and Claire for failing to send their child to school, although it has agreed to pause proceedings after the M.E.N requested a comment about the case. If convicted, the couple face a fine or even a prison sentence. They said they will take me to court, said Carl. Fine,thataposs what it takes to explain it all, we will go to court. It seems extreme that Rudiaposs future should now be decided in a criminal court room. Carl and Claire struggle to understand how it got to this point. Speaking at the familyaposs neatly-kept home last week, the couple showed the M.E.N a pile of paper documents relating to Rudiaposs problems at school. It has already been a long and intimidating process. Rudiaposs violent behaviour began just months after he first started in nursery at St Malachyaposs in September . As might be expected of such a young child, many of the incidents were petulant in nature. They offered him a pear, and he doesnapost like pears, said Carl. So he threw it at the teacher and cut her lip. He was excluded from reception for that. Staff tried to handle Rudiaposs outbursts by taking him out of the room, but by reception, his behaviour was escalating. They said he was just getting more angry, said Carl They did get a psychologist in, a behaviour specialist. But they only came one day and didnapost see anything. The teacher told us theyaposre trained in holding techniques but they donapost like using it. If theyaposd have held him until he calmed down, then he gives hugs and kisses out to the teachers. If theyaposd held him, he wouldnapost have got excluded, or he would have got the help earlier on.  In response to Claire and Carlaposs claims, a spokesperson for the Diocese of Salford, the organisation that runs St Malchyaposs said: It would not be appropriate to comment on the inidual circumstances of any one pupil . At St Malachyaposs all decisions are taken in the best interest of our school community. However, it is understood the schoolaposs position is that only aposselectedapos, more senior staff are trained in holding techniques and that other de-escalation techniques were used with Rudi following advice from an external behaviour consultant. Often, Rudi doesnapost appear to even remember what has happened after a violent episode at school and will be hugging the same teachers he was hitting only minutes earlier. Claire and Carl describe their son as a aposlovingapos little boy who likes giving out hugs so much he even embraces the staff at his local ASDA.  Rudi has both younger and older siblings and doesnapost seem to suffer the same rage blackouts with them or his parents.  I said to one of the teachers aposis it really that bad apos said Claire.   So she showed me a video of it on the iPad and I couldnapost believe it. I thought aposis that really Rudi apos thataposs not my son. He was in a rage, his face looked dferent and everything I thought aposoh my godapos. I was heartbroken.   Itaposs like he sees red and doesnapost know what heaposs doing, but I donapost know what triggers it off.   This is what we want to find out - weaposve been begging for help. Over the past eighteen months, Rudiaposs parents, his GP and staff at St Malachyaposs have all referred him to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Serviceson several occasions. But CAMHS repeatedly refused to see Rudi on the basis he did not aposfit the criteriaapos. Carl and Claire say they were told in person they would have to wait until he was six before he would be seen. That appears to be true as CAMHS offered an appointment three days after Rudi turned six in December. But while they are happy to finally see a step forward, Carl and Claire fear it will still be a y process before Rudi gets the help he needs. And they believeRudi had been seen earlier, he might not have ended up being permanently excluded in the first place.  Heaposs heartbroken he canapost go to school, but itaposs just aposhard luck, nobodyaposs going to even look at you yetapos, said Claire. We shouldnapost be in this predicament, it should all be in place before the child is permanently excluded. He should have been sent to the PRU while he was at school. Weaposve looked into finding him another one nearer us but there isnapost one. I went in [to CAMHS] crying saying aposplease help me, what have I got to do apos, they said heaposs got to be six. Meanwhile, with Rudi now having been out of school for more than four months, the effects are starting to show. His preference is to be at St Malachyaposs and his absence is made all the more painful as he often accompanies his dad when dropping off and picking up his older brother. Mum Claire says Rudi now often refuses to eat or hides food around the house at meal times. The teacher hugged him the other day and said aposRudi youaposve lost weightapos, said Claire. Itaposs shocking. At dinner, he was crying, aposIaposm not eating it, Iaposm not eating itapos. He goes to pick his brother up and heaposs crying saying aposwhy canapost I go to school apos Heaposs only a baby - he doesnapost know whataposs happened. He says aposIaposm missing my friendsapos. Heaposs missing out on a lot. Claire and Carl are aware that some people might write them off as bad parents because of Rudiaposs predicament. But they say they couldnapost be trying any harder to do whataposs best for him and get him back in school. We just feel like weaposre hitting our heads off a wall, said Claire. The doctor said, aposyouaposve hit a brick wall, thereaposs no help out there for that age groupapos.  Imagine we were those parents who donapost caretheir kids go to school  Our kids donapost get a day off. We make sure they get up in the morning, theyaposre not even late.  It seems like itaposs all down to money though, nobody wants to help you, you get told aposphone this person, phone that personapos, weaposve phoned that many people weaposre going round in circles. Manchester Council funds aposhome to schoolapos transport services via the Travel Co-Ordination Unit. It is a complicated process that usually involves a child already having a statement of Special Educational Needsor Education, Health and Careplan. Rudi has neither because he has yet to be assessed by a professional. But evenhe does get an SEN statement, his parents may struggle to get travel support getting him to school. In its - budget, the council said there are aposexisting budget pressuresapos totalling £.million aposrelating to Special Education Needs and Disabilityhome to school transport, leaving care accommodation and adoption allowances. As a result, the council intends to save £, from its Travel Co-Ordination budget between -. However, the M.E.N understands efforts are now being made to try and resolve the situation with Rudiaposs travel arrangements. He is also due to have his first appointment with the CAMHS service in the next few days. But Claire and Carl still have a long way to go with getting Rudi back in full-time education and receiving the help he needs. There must be other kids going through this, said Carl. I think it should be highlighted that no matter what age you are,you need help, you need help. Not just my kids, all the other kids out there. In  , there were  permanent exclusions from Manchester schools, a decrease of  compared with the year before. This included  in secondary school and  in primary. But the details of Rudiaposs case suggests there is still work to do.

Parents Mark and India Aldridge were devastated when doctors told them newborn Ralph would never sit, stand, crawl or walk. Now thanks to pioneering specialist physio Ralph, aged two, can keep up with his twin brother Wilbur, attend nursery and feel his proud parents tickling his feet. India said: “To see him shouting ‘Me walk, me walk’ makes my heart melt with joy.” The couple’s world fell apart eight hours after the twins’ birth in December  when Ralph was rushed to hospital with a brain haemorrhage and put into a coma. India, , said: “He was completely floppy, like a rag doll, and head to toe in bruises.” Two weeks later he was scanned at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, South London. The parents were told Ralph would never move below his waist. His hips were also out of alignment, with his feet twisted backwards. The wait for NHS physio was up to three months. India said: “It was hopeless and we felt powerless.”  They were paying for weekly private physio at their home but in April  saw a TV news item about Neurokinex Kids, a new rehab facility for children with a spinal cord injury in Crawley, West Sussex,  miles from their South London home in New Malden. Ralph was referred for six free NHS sessions, which he started that May . India said: “A weight was lted from our shoulders. The equipment and expertise was mind-blowing and the sense of positivity gave us hope for the first time since the birth.”  Specialist physios encouraged Ralph to play games to develop his core, his leg strength and the ­alignment from his hips to his feet through activities such as throwing balls into hoops and soft-play facilities. With intensive training he simulated walking on a ­treadmill supported by a ­harness while electrical stimulation therapy ­activated his nerve paths.

George King, , shared a cell with violent criminals and saw a string of stabbings and other attacks. But as he left Pentonville Prison in North London, he told the Sunday Mirror he has no regrets about climbing the ,ft Shard which towers over the capital. George, a free solo climber, said: “My biggest fear in le is regret. We all die, but not everyone lives le before.” Of his time behind bars, he said: “I had seven cell-mates – drug dealers and gang members. “I saw stabbings on most days. I saw somebody get kettled, when boiling water was thrown over them. “Kids were self-harming every day with razor blades.” George, from Oxford, only ended up in a men’s jail because Feltham Young Offenders Institution was full. He was  when jailed in October after the Shard’s owners brought a civil case against him for breaching an injunction against “persons unknown” entering the building. Although police were waiting for George at the top they merely escorted him off the premises and took no further action.  George and his parents believe he should have got community service rather than being jailed at huge taxpayer expense. Guidance says civil prisoners should be kept apart from convicted criminals – yet George found himself among seasoned offenders. Responding to critics who say his actions, which saw London Bridge station closed briefly, were dangerous, he said: “The police officers who met me at the top said it made their week.  “People go out drinking every weekend and cause violence, they’re the ones who put a strain on the emergency services. I want to inspire people to conquer their goals, follow their passions.” He prepared for his Shard assent by tackling the world’s largest climbing wall, in the Netherlands, and scaling hundreds of cranes, including one near Wembley Stadium. He said of his Shard escapade last July: “It wasn’t about the attention, it was the thrill of getting to the top.”  His mum Hilary, , who works in property, criticised the decision to jail him. She said: “For five weeks he didn’t have a change of clothes. He wasn’t even supposed to be in there. “I spoke to the prison chaplain and he said George should never have been on that wing – he was sent down for breaching an injunction, not for a criminal conviction. I have barely slept for three months.” Hilary has no plans to stop him from pursuing his passions, adding: “He’s so determined, I don’t think we could ever stop him. I’d rather he didn’t, but he knows what he’s doing and he’s very good at it.”George’s chartered surveyor dad Clive, , added: “For so long we didn’t know what he was up to. “We had an inkling when a grappling hook turned up in the post, but we never anticipated this.” George, who plans to publish a book and venture into bare-knuckle boxing and BASE jumping, fell foul of an injunction taken out to halt a class equality protest at the Shard in .

They put “blood, sweat and tears” into the two-bed dump, bought under a council regeneration scheme. Debbie and Ste were shaken when they first stepped through the door – armed with a £, schedule of works from Liverpool City Council to bring it up to scratch. The th century terraced house had been hit by fire and had crumbling walls, broken bricks and burnt joists. But the couple worked -, did most of the renovations themselves and in  months transformed it into a cosy home for just £,. After enjoying their first Christmas in the double-fronted home in the city’s Wavertree district, the pair have been buoyed by a valuation of £,. Debbie, , says: “We never want to move because we have put so much of ourselves into this house. People thought we were nuts. “We’ve crawled on the floors, we built the floors… it’s a gamble we took and we love it. Our blood and guts have gone into it. If they’d give us next door, we’d do it again!” Recalling the first time she saw the property, Debbie says: “It was just a shell. All the joists were burnt. It was terrible. “Honestly, it was just stacks and stacks of bricks. There was nothing. My family were saying to me, ‘You’re mad’.”  Every floor had to be replaced, chimneys were removed, the sinking kitchen was underpinned, all fittings were ripped out and the windows were upgraded. Debbie and Ste, , used their savings and took a small loan to complete the work – and it was hard graft. We were there until midnight with torches. We went seven days a week, we didn’t miss a day,” Debbie says. She scoured local ads for bargains and bagged a £, kitchen for a tenth of the price and a £, bathroom suite for £,. They also picked up a slightly damaged £, front door for £.  And, slowly but surely, the place came together. Now it is a shining example of how Liverpool is breathing new le into former slums. The council unveiled its Homes For A Pound scheme in . A year later, bosses vowed that , empty houses would be brought back into use. Since then, , homes have been reoccupied – including  in the Webster Triangle, Wavertree, where the Hodges live. Seven more families are due to move in soon. A similar scheme has since been launched in Stoke-on-Trent. Last year, a Channel  documentary about the renovations in Liverpool featured Debbie and Ste.  The couple say the sense of community in the Webster Triangle is a great example of how councils candepressed areas to homely neighbourhoods. The Hodges used to rent in Anfield and had struggled to get a mortgage. Debbie suffered a serious long-term illness and Ste’s wages as a carpet cleaner were not enough to secure a home loan. Debbie says: “The council scheme was the best thing to happen to us. It brings communities together. When we moved in, there were only about three houses in the road occupied. But it’s moving on now, it’s coming to be more of a community and about half the street is filled.  “We’ve met all the neighbours and introduced ourselves. People come from everywhere, dferent areas, dferent countries. It’s a lovely community and I’m really settled here. I just love it. Once a month we clean the street and make it nice. The area is coming up, there are bars and restaurants opening further down the road… I just wouldn’t move. “I can definitely see the area getting better and we’ve never been so happy.” The couple have two daughters – Jade, , a psychologist who has her own home, and -year-old teaching assistant Jenna, who still lives with her parents and is studying for an MSC. Debbie hopes the Homes For A Pound scheme will help young Liverpudlians like Jenna get on the property ladder.

Karl Lewis-law, , spent £, on his visit to hell on earth to Jamaica to celebrate his th wedding anniversary with his we Caroline, , for nearly a month. The professional caterers from Canterbury, Kent say they were shocked when they saw staff members in public selling drugs and guests snorting cocaine on tables in front of children. TUI say there have been no complaints of similar activity at the resort. The couple were staying from November  to December  at the five-star platinum Ti rated hotel Grand Palladium Lady Hamilton Resort  Spa in Lucea near Montego Bay, Jamaica. Complaints on TripAdvisor dating nine months ago have also claimed staff are selling drugs to guests, however the majority of reviews are positive. aposThreestixapos wrote in April  that his friend was offered drugs on the beaches while they were staying there. Maggie Muck said in February  the only negative was: If you are a young guy or a girl, you will definitely be asked by literally every local resort workeryou want weed. Just a heads up, my boyfriend was getting annoyed by how many people asked him.  Karl wrote on TUIaposs Facebook page sharing pictures on January  saying: This hotel is no more than a two star rating and certainly Not  star Platinum. With evidence of faulty electrics throughout the property, debris and broken glass on the beaches, cockroach infestation, substandard and too often times of inedible food, coupled with public displays of drug dealing on a daily basis. Even staff members were drunk on duty and a member of staff being stretchered away to an ambulance following a drunken fall, in full public gaze. The images show raw meat given to the customers for one of the meals, broken chairs and roofs appearing to fall apart with live cables exposed on the grass or from above.  Karl said: With regards to our visit to hell on earth. On arrival to the hotel we suffered daily power cuts that could last anything from two minutes to an hour and they would happen daily at least four or five times a day. We endured two and three hour queues for food and restaurants again on a daily basis, when you did get to eat there would be no crockery on the tables, no cutlery on the tables, so you couldnapost even eat when you got into a restaurant. The food in the restaurants was nothing short of disgraceful. We are unhappy about the fact that there was at least four incidents of people either breaking bones or seriously injuring themselves.  One member of staff fell from a balcony and hit a storm drain, the resulting injury was nothing short of horrendous with his head and face split wide open for all to see, not something you would expect on your five star premium holiday experience. We are particularly upset about live and exposed electrics hanging from ceilings or lying in soaking wet grass that could easily either seriously injure someone who may either step on it or even worse a child touches one. It would be all over for them. Karl also said he spotted staff members openly selling drugs around children.  He added: Staff walking around openly selling drugs, guests snorting coke off the tables in full view of families and children, and when customers complain you absolve yourselves [TUI] of any responsibility. Dealing goes on, on the beaches. A staff member fell off the top balcony of our accommodation block, customer injuries happened on walkways and stairs during the rain, ideally as the floors are marble. They have mats and signs to tell guests that the floors are wet and slippery, however these are always too late to be put out and guests hurt themselves.  Two broken legs and two sprained or injured wrists and forearms. I think one of the guests even walked into a sharp splinter that stabbed her in the stomach, it pierced the skin but she said she was fine. The Jamaican government decriminalised drugs in  making the possession of around . grams a petty offence and no longer a criminal offence as long as it is used for medicinal, scientic, religious and medical purposes.

The royal rebels Harry and Meghan turned to their “rock” Elton as they grappled with their controversial decision to quit senior duties. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been speaking to the showbiz legend – a pal of Harry’s mum Diana – every day for months. They even told him about their plans before informing the Queen.

The Queen and princes will have written briefings before meeting for the first time since the crisis began. A senior Palace source said: “The family will gather at Sandringham to talk things through. Following meetings and consultations there are a range of possibilities for the family to review which take into account the thinking the Sussexes outlined. “Making a change to the working le and role for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex requires complex and thoughtful discussion. Next steps will be agreed and the request for this to be resolved at pace – days, not weeks – is still Her Majesty’s wish.” The summit comes as insiders revealed Sir Elton’s support.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailMeghan Markle and Kate Middleton have not spoken to each other for six months and the two women are ­further apart than ever, the Sunday People can reveal. The revelation follows this week’s announcement by Prince Harry and we Meghan that they are stepping down from their senior roles in the Royal Family and want to become financially independent. The Queen will oversee an ­emergency summit on Monday at Sandringham, in Norfolk, between Prince Charles, Prince William and Harry to sort out the next stages of the couple’s plan to quit The Firm. Meghan, , is expected to join in the crisis meeting by video link from the couple’s rented mansion on Vancouver Island, western Canada where she is staying with eight-month-old son Archie. According to royal sources, she will make the conference callit works with her schedule owing to the eight-hour time dference ­between Vancouver and the UK. As the crisis continues, it is understood Meghan, , was left feeling so cut off from the royals that she and her sister-in-law Kate ­severed all communication on a ­family WhatsApp chat group. It is believed the pair have not spoken ­privately for six months and are further apart than ever following Meghan seemingly ignoring Kate’s th birthday ­celebrations at Kensington Palace and flying back to Canada on Thursday. Meghan and Harry, , were also absent for Kate’s birthday weekend at Sandringham last Sunday. An insider old the Sunday People: “Meghan feels like some members of the Royal Family look down on her because of her background. “It has caused her a lot of upset and left relations in a very sorry state. They must find a way to ­resolve it and move forward as a family united.” Kate, who ­enjoyed Meghan’s company while watching tennis from Wimbledon’s Royal box on Centre Court in July, is ­understood to have been disappointed by Harry and Meghan’s ­sensational decision to step down as ­senior royals. And she is said to be angry that they went ahead with their announcement without getting clearance from the Queen. She and husband William, , reportedly found out it was happening only ten minutes before it began leading TV news bulletins on Wednesday night. Tomorrow the -year-old Queen will meet Harry, Prince Charles, , and William for the emergency ­summit on the Sandringham royal estate to sort out the next stage. It is understood the four will be given written briefings before they meet in person for the first time since this week’s bombshell. A series of proposals have been drawn up following meetings ­between senior royal aides, civil servants from the UK and Canada and police forces including the London Met force who provide ­security for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. A senior palace source said: “Following a series of meetings and consultations across the last few days there are a range of possibilities for the family to review which take into account the thinking the Sussexes outlined in the week.  “Next steps will be agreed at the meeting and the request for this to be resolved at pace is still Her Majesty’s wish. “The aim remains for this to be in days, not weeks. “There is genuine agreement and understanding that any decision will take time to be implemented.” We can also reveal that Harry and Meghan have turned to Elton John after secretly telling him they were planning to quit royal le before they informed the Queen. They have been inspired by the success of his Aids Foundation, which has raised millions. And they want to follow its model by hosting star-studded gala dinners to support their chosen charities.Our insider said: “Sir Elton is constantly at the end of the phone for Harry and Meghan and speaks to them every day. “He is an inspiration to them and has been an almost motherly figure to them throughout this process. They made their decision on their own but he has been a shoulder to lean on and listened to them as they spoke about their own plans.” Another source added: “He has been their rock. While he would never tell them what to do he has been a listening ear throughout.” A spokesman for Sir Elton last night said: “Elton supports the fact that Harry and Meghan are admirably taking control of their lives.  He cares about them both and their ­family deeply and is fully supportive of any decisions the couple make, knowing they are made by them alone ­without outside influence and with their future ­happiness and ­wellbeing in mind.” Palace aides yesterday issued a strong denial after the couple’s ITV News at Ten pal Tom Bradby claimed they had been “driven out” of the Royal Family. Bradby, who has known Harry for  years, claimed top courtiers made clear to the couple “there was going to be a slimmed-down monarchy and they weren’t really a part of it”.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailMeghan Markle and Prince Harry are rumoured to be planning a apostell-all interviewapos in the US - and close pal and CBS host Gayle King could be the favourite to secure the exclusive chat. Reports emerged that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex could be planning to sit down with CBS Newsapos chief anchor to discuss their shock decision to step down from royal duties, according to Page Six . The couple have already opened up about their lives while filming Harry  Meghan: An African Journey when they spoke with ITV journalist Tom Bradby about their lives as newlyweds and new parents. It was during that interview that Meghan suggested the couple were apossurvivingapos rather than aposthrivingapos, something that is thought to have played into their shock announcement earlier this week. In an unprecedented move, Harry and Meghan revealed their plans to take on a pared down and more aposprogressiveapos role in the Royal family , which will see them become financially independent and able to earn an income. The Queen was said to be deeply disappointed by the coupleaposs decision to rush their statement out to the public.  Itaposs thought that an interview with Ms King could be a way for the Sussexes to discuss their plans going forward. The CBS host has previously suggested that she became friends with the Duchess of Sussex in the months leading up to the birth of her son, Archie Harrison. Speaking last year on the subject of Meghanaposs baby shower in CBS interview with some of the Duchesses close friends, Gayle said: Daniel [Martin] and friends, including Serena Williams, invited  people... and I was one of them. Over the last few months, Meghan and I have become friends. We all gathered at The Mark Hotel in New York City. As part of the festivities, we created floral arrangements. Another close friend of the couple, Oprah Winfrey, could also be in line for the sought-after interview. Itaposs already been confirmed that Prince Harry will be launching a special mental health series on AppleTV+ which he has co-created and executive produced with TV presenter and talk show host. Oprah felt compelled to speak out this week, telling People magazine that she had nothing to do with the Duke and Duchessapos decision to step back from their royal roles. She said: Meghan and Harry do not need my help figuring out whataposs best for them. I care about them both and support whatever decisions they make for their family. Page Six had previously reported that Oprah was advising the couple on building their own brand. And of course, the couple could opt to speak with Tom Bradby a second time as they reveal the thinking behind their bold move. In the days and hours before the announcement, Mr Bradby said the idea of the couple leaving the UK was no secret, telling Good Morning Britain that Meghan and Harry were considering their options for the future. It remains to be seen who will secure the lucrative interview with the couple. In a short statement, a media representative for CBS claimed Gayle King had not been in discussions with Meghan and Harry, or their representatives, about doing an interview at this point in time. Since the Duke and Duchess made their shock announcement, Meghan has fled to Canada to rejoin her son, Archie, eight months. Meanwhile, Harry is said to be locked in talks with the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William, as staff at Buckingham Palace work out how to coordinate the new roles Harry and Meghan want to take on.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex made a shock announcement on Wednesday that they would be stepping back from senior royal duties and carve out a progressive new role. The couple want to achieve financial independence and will now split their time between the UK and North America. The Queen was said to be disappointed by the news with Buckingham Palace saying these were complicated issues which needed to be worked through. Will they keep their royal titles, what will the new role involve and how do the couple plan to make money  Hereaposs what we know...What is aposMegxitapos  After spending the Christmas holidays in Canada, on Wednesday a statement was posted on the Sussexaposs Instagram announcing they wish to step back as senior members of the Royal Family and become financially independent. The couple said they will continue to fully support the Queen, the Commonwealth, and their patronages but also focus on the launch of their new charitable entity.  Was the Queen told beforehand  After the news broke the Queen was said to be disappointed by the bombshell announcement. A statement from Buckingham Palace released shortly after said: Discussions with The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage. We understand their desire to take a dferent approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through. On Thursday, January , the Queen led an emergency four-way call from Sandringham, with Prince Charles dialling in from Scotland and Princes William and Harry in London.  Why do they want to step back  The couple may have been planning to step back for months with a royal source saying it all stems from their tour in South Africa. The source said Harry saw Meghan was struggling and told her he did not want to do another tour with the press and said they would go their own way. Meghan admitted royal le had been hard and she had not been prepared for the intensity of the media scrutiny in an ITV documentary filmed during their tour. Prince Harry was also asked about his brother Prince William during the documentary, following reports the brothers had fallen out. He said the pair were on dferent paths but he loved him dearly and the the majority of stuff was created out of nothing. The couple broke away from the Royal Foundation charity they shared with Prince William and Kate last year.  Where will Harry and Meghan live now  The couple said they will split their time between the UK and North America. In a statement released on their new website, Prince Harry and Meghan said they would continue to use Frogmore Cottage as their official residence but only with the Queenaposs permission. The couple spent £.m refurbishing the royal residence last year. Renovations were funded through the Sovereign Grant - a sum of money given to the Monarch from the Government annually which is made up of Crown Estate profits. Expenses relating to fixtures, furnishings and fittings were funded privately by the couple. Although the couple have not said where they will live in North America, many believe Canada is their preferred option. Meghan lived in Toronto for years while working on seven series of US legal drama Suits and has many friends in the city, which she is said to consider her home. The couple spent Christmas in Vancouver and Meghan has now flown back there to be with baby Archie.  How will they become financially independent and what will it cost  The couple said they value the ability to earn a professional income which they are currently prohibited from doing. It is thought once they become financially autonomous they will make money by expanding their charitable work and striking commercial deals under the Royal Sussex brand. The couple made an application to trademark Sussex Royal last year. Prince Harryaposs fortune is thought to stand around £m, much of which he inherited from his mother Princess Diana and the Queen Mother. Meghan is said to have brought an estimated £m to their marriage. The couple currently receive five per cent of their funding from the Sovereign Grant. The other  per cent is from the income received by Prince Charles, generated by the Duchy of Cornwall. Prince Harry and Meghan will no longer receive the Sovereign Grant but said they hope to still receive money from Prince Charles. Prince Harry and Meghan said they will continue to have publicly-funded security by The politan Police which is mandated by the Home Office. The Government refuses to break down the cost of security, although it is estimated to add up to £m. It is unclear who will fund security for the couple in North America, it may be funded by taxpayers apos or privately. The couple have already said all their private travel is paid for privately and not by UK taxpayers.  However all overseas visits are paid for by the Sovereign Grant and contributions from host countries. The Queen may also decide to charge the couple rent for Frogmore Cottage. This could be as much as £, per year.  Will they lose their titles  The couple suggest on their website they will be able to keep their titles, citing historic precedent and Prince Harry will remain sixth in line to the throne. Princess Beatrice and Eugenie both have jobs and hold titles.  What does this mean for Archie  The couple ed from their festive break in Canada earlier this week, but left baby Archie in Canada with his nanny. After the announcement Meghan ed to Canada. On their website the couple said they plan to raise Archie with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born. Splitting time between the UK and US may mean Archie is not able to attend the schools traditional to the Royal Family. Canada has more than  independent schools but the couple will not have to make a decision on his schooling for at least a couple more years.

But she felt concern when she realised Meghan and Harry were getting serious, doubting whether she would be able to cope with the pressure.  She felt Meghan would struggle to conform and that she didnapost truly understand the royal world, its history and traditions. And as Meghan told her aposI donapost wanna hear it,apos Gina said she felt uncomfortable in her presence for the first time.

The former HR specialist persuaded hubby Dan to up sticks and hit the road in a ft campervan for the trip of a letime with kids Monty, eight, and Winter, five. They bought the £, Hymer . diesel just  hours after selling their terrace home – and were on their way through Europe and on to Africa barely a week or so later. Now, after their “most relaxed Christmas ever”, Rosie and co are geared up for the next leg of their journey – with no regrets whatsoever. Winter sums it up neatly, saying: “I just love it! Our house has wheels and we can go anywhere in the whole wide world. “I love seeing new things in all of the new countries, learning the languages and making new friends everywhere.” And brother Monty says: “I like going on walks with Daddy, and when we all go on bike rides. I’ve met new friends from all over and I get to see the sea and beach so much.” The family paid for the trip by making £, from selling their home in Ilkeston, Derbyshire. Rosie says: “People have said they wish they could afford to do what we’ve done, but we aren’t rich. We just decided to live dferently and not worry about material things. “This has been amazing for our family. The children have seen incredible places and met people from all over the world. It’s really opened our eyes to what’s important in le.” So far the Beesons have made two trips to Europe – travelling through France, Spain and Portugal. After a brieffor a family wedding they drove to Wales and through Ireland before heading back to the continent. They also visited Gibraltar before sailing to Morocco – where they are now. Rosie says the strain of home schooling her children and constantly juggling work commitments triggered thoughts of travel.She spotted a Facebook page about parents home teaching their kids while travelling the world. And after research, she tackled Dan, , who worked long hours as a production manager. Rosie says: “We realised we didn’t want that  to  le, with no energy for family time and no money for holidays. We sat down one evening and I said to Dan, ‘What do you think about selling everything to travel the world ’ His eyes widened. I believe he thought I was joking, but I’d been researching and had answers for all his questions. “It was a huge decision that we wouldn’t make overnight, so we both went away to think. Dan looked up everything there was to know about motorhomes and a week later, we sat down and he told me, ‘Let’s do it.’ Not a single person said we were insane. Everyone thinks it’s amazing.” Rosie used to work in HR with the Army but quit to concentrate on her family. She did bar work and began home educating Monty after he was diagnosed with autism.  After hatching the travel plan, the family began shedding possessions and Rosie even gave away her wedding dress. Then, last February, they sold the house and bought the Hymer. It has two beds for the kids, a pull-down for the adults, a kitchenette, tables and chairs. Rosie goes on: “Loads of friends and family came over to help us set the van up and take the last few bits to the tip. “We all had a drink together and when it was time to go, they all lined up down the road to wave us off. There were lots of tears, but the love and support we felt was incredible.”  The family took a ferry from Portsmouth to St Malo in France, before crossing the Pyrenees via Andorra, into Spain and then on to Portugal. Rosie recalls: “We had a really surreal moment driving from Arcachon to Lourdes in France. We were hurtling down country roads through this endless, deadly flat land, when Dan and I looked up and suddenly there were the Pyrenees in front of us. “They looked like a mirage. Snowy peaks just there in the sky.” The family log their adventures on a Facebook blog called The Migratory Bees – and record the trip in a book.  Rosie’s highlights have included a Game of Thrones tour in Ireland and spending Winter’s fth birthday in December riding camels in the Sahara. Christmas was spent in the fortied village of Ait Ben Haddou, Morocco. Rosie explains: “It was the most relaxed we’ve ever had. The children only had a few presents, but they were so happy and grateful. “We went out for a meal in a Chinese restaurant and just took the day slowly. Of course we missed our family but we loved our plan-free day.”  Rosie estimates they can survive until September, when they will need to take odd jobs as they travel. She says: “We’ve tried to be savvy, to keep going as long as possible. I don’t worry about the future, as I’ve had nothing and worked my way out of it before.” Rosie believes that seeing the world is giving her children a better education thanthey were in a classroom. And she has been touched by the camaraderie among travellers, saying: “Everybody helps each other. Once, Monty came to the rescue of a couple who had locked themselves out, as he was small enough to climb through their motorhome’s skylight. “Another time we set up what we called the Beeson barbershop, cutting hair for people on our campsite.”  So where to next  Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark are all on the cards. And Rosie insists that won’t be as tiring as it sounds.

The -year-old monarch was photographed as she was driving her black Range Rover down a road near her private Sandringham Estate in Norfolk yesterday. She is seen wearing a headscarf with dog prints and a winter jacket. Passengers and a dog are also seen in her car. It is against the law to drive without a seat belt on, but the Queen is immune from any civil or criminal proceedings.Just a year ago, on January , Prince Philip, then , was involved in a crash with a Kia car after he pulled his Land Rover Freelander out of a side road onto the A near Sandringham. He was unharmed but had to be helped out of his overturned car.  Driver of the Kia, Ellie Townsend, suffered cuts to her knee and her passenger Emma Fairweather broke her wrist. They were both taken to hospital. Ms Townsendaposs nine-month-old baby escaped unhurt. According to a witness at the scene, the Duke had blamed the dazzling sun.Prince Philip was back driving without a seat belt less than  hours after the accident. But he gave up his driving licence a month later and apologised after Ms Fairweather complained about the lack of apology from the Royal Family. The Crown Prosecution Service in February decided not to prosecute the royal, saying it would not be in the public interest.  The Sunday Times reported in May last year that the Queen had agreed to give up driving on public roads on advice of her security team after the crash. The monarch, who has been driving for more than  years, has never taken a driving test and is the only person in the UK allowed to drive without a licence.

Bethany Robinson, , suffers from bipolar disorder and planned to throw herself in front of a train as she battled through a “dark depression”. It was only when her sister Elouise Gregor, , introduced her to weightlting and CrossFit exercise that Bethany’s condition eased. It proved to be the making of her – literally saving her le. Bethany says: “If Elouise hadn’t have helped me, I wouldnapost be here today.” Now they are the first sisters to take part in SAS: Who Dares Wins – the Channel  show that sees recruits go through brutal special forces training. Bethany, an art teacher from Cornwall, says: “I was in a black hole and didn’t know how to get out. I definitely would have killed myself. “My sister rang my mum the day I’d planned to do it and my mum called the police, who came and got me. “I don’t remember the two months after that because I was in such a deep depression. Elouise hatched a plan to help me. She set up a home gym and encouraged me to start exercising. I began feeling better straight away – it set me on the road to recovery.” Bethany had put on weight during her depression and reached  stone. But after working out, she lost six stone in a year. She has since lost a further stone. The sisters compete in CrossFit and Olympic power-lting and have dozens of podium finishes between them. Elouise, a solicitor, says: “It was horric seeing Beth being so self-destructiveand unhappy. I would have done anything to help her.“She pushed me away, but the gym was the place we reconnected. We became best friends again.” Bethany’s issues began after she left an abusive relationship aged . She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after two particularly bad episodes. She explains: “I was in the darkest depression, but I had lots of energy because I was coming off of a manic period and had been out partying.  “My mind was telling me there was no way out and nothing was ever going to get better. All I could think about was killing myself. It was totally irrational.“It happened twice. The first time, I planned to throw myself under a train.I was determined to do it. Luckily the train station was closed and my sister rang my mum, who called the police.“The second time, I had all these thoughts about killing myself. I banged my head against a wall, because I thoughtI could knock myself out, the thoughts would stop. I got help after those two episodes – I don’t think I’d have survived a third.”  Bethany began counselling and was put on medication in mid-. But by the end of the year, doctors told her it wasn’t working. That’s when Elouise stepped in and encouraged Bethany – who had been sporty in her youth – to start working out. They lted weights in their home gym and Bethany found she was good at it. She says: “I got back into fitness by deadlting – I could lt kg, which is a huge amount for a woman. It made me fall in love with the sport and I started going to CrossFit six times a week with Elouise. I felt the exercise helping straight away. It made me confident. Suddenly I was good at something. “I started to feel so much better about myself. It really brought me closer to my sister. We became best friends again. We encourage each other.”  Exercising was so helpful to Bethany’s mental health that she now no longer has bipolar episodes. She says: “Since I found fitness, my mental health issues have been under control. My mood still fluctuates, but not dramatically. It is now within the normal range. I found that with good sleep, nutrition and exercise, I can control my bipolar. It’s been amazing, I never looked back.” Spurred on by her recovery and her love of fitness, Bethany applied to go on the TV show – and Elouise followed suit. They were invited to a fitness test and got told off for cheering each other on! The show sees contestants pushed to the limits, physically and mentally.  But the sisters – who feature in tonight’s episode – loved every minute. Bethany says: “We communicate without even having to speak, so it was a great support being there together. “With everything I’ve been through, taking part in SAS has actually been a lot of fun. It made me deal with a lot of things, which is a positive. It proved to me I’m stronger than I think I am. “It helped me overcome moments of doubt. It pulls you apart and puts you back together. I wanted to prove that, after my mental health struggles with bipolar disorder, I’m OK now. “I can not only cope with the stresses of competing in a sport and everyday le, but I can take on one of the most stressful and challenging courses and come out just as mentally strong as before. “Having bipolar disorder no longer holds me back.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast storm brendan","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Storm Brendan to batter Britain with mph galesThe Met Office has warned of travel disruption while Storm Brendan ravages Britains west coast with wind gusts up to mph - Met Office yellow weather warnings are in effectShareCommentsByTfany Lo:,  JAN NewsHuge waves will batter seafronts \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

He said: Itaposs going to be windy across the western half of the UK, with gusts reaching -mph along Irish Sea coastlines, the west of Scotland and perhaps some English Channel coasts - maybe even mph in a few exposed places. Mr Saunders added those in affected areas are advised to take extra care when driving on exposed routes such as bridges or high open roads. He said: As Storm Brendan moves eastwards, strong winds will also develop across eastern parts of the UK, particularly northeast Scotland where there is also a wind warning in place. As well as strong winds, there will be large coastal waves in western areas, so bear this in mind before heading out in these regions.  Looking further ahead to the rest of next week, he said: It looks like itaposs going to stay very unsettled with the potential for further disruptive weather in places.

Plain and simple. While many sympathise with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s desire to step back as senior Royals, the way they chose to do it has provoked justiable shock and outrage. Petulant, hot-headed and impulsive are just some of the barbs aimed at the couple after the bombshell public announcement that they wished to become part-time Royals and live much of the time abroad. Inconsiderate, disloyal and reckless might also be appropriate. In more than  years on the throne, the Queen has shown with impeccable style, dignity and judgement how the “old firm” should be run. The sacrices she and other members of the Royal Family have made have been not only for the monarchy, but for the nation. That, by the antiquated system of a monarchic state, is their responsibility by birth. And Her Majesty embraced that responsibility with grace, as even republicans admit. Harry and Meghan’s wish to break away might be seen as an understandable cry for modernisation. Their desire to do so has been evident for a long time. But discussing their intentions with friends such as Elton John before the Queen, and going ahead with their announcement without thinking through the full impact on their family or the monarchy, has caused a totally avoidable crisis. That the Queen has had to intervene – calling a Royal showdown at Sandringham tomorrow to deal with the crisis – is a measure of the scale of the embarrassment caused.  She is right to step in and call the wayward couple to heel. Only she has the authority to bang heads together and ensure a smoother route to whatever the future holds. The Wrong Cure  The crisis in our health service starts at the front line, the family doctor. The GP is an absolute cornerstone of the National Health Service, the first stop for all ages from cradle to grave. It is a service that is essential to personal health, and to the economy of the country. With a shortage of at least , GPs, Tory promises of more on the way are not enough. Government action on over-complicated red tape preventing overseas doctors from coming here to ease the gap is long overdue. Rocking On Rod Stewart is a national treasure who just refuses to act his age.

The Michelin-starred chef, , admitted there are common mistakes many of us fall foul of at home. These include buying poor quality cuts of meat and seasoning the steaks incorrectly, reports Daily Star Online. But we also must remember to allow the beef to rest after cooking, the chef says. In his new book Marcus Everyday, the restaurateur, who was raised in Southport, Merseyside, suggests ways to try to replicate steak that you’re served in restaurants. But it comes afterexclusively revealed a top chef who befriended a lying Tory MP was part of a recent team which picked the UKaposs aposbest steakapos. Buy a good quality cut of meat The quality of meat is hugely important, Mr Wareing says. Those who use grisly cuts are unlikely to achieve good results, no matter how well they cook them. First, buy a good piece of meat, the chef writes.  Take steaks out before cooking them It is also essential to take the steaks out of the fridge a few hours before you cook them. This lets you get the middle of the beef perfect after grilling. Mr Wareing urges: Make sure it’s at room temperature before you cook it –you want it served medium or medium-rare you’re not going to get it hot in the middleit’s fridge cold.Take it out of the fridge a good couple of hours before cooking.  Season the steaks properly The MasterChef host says the seasoning is crucial to the meataposs flavour. No one likes a bland steak, after all. But not only can salt draw juiciness out, it can also give your dish a bitter flavour. Season the meat just before it goes into the pan, only seasoning the side that hits the pan first, the author says. If you season it in advance the salt will draw the water out of the meat, which will then spit at your from the pan and make the meat taste a little acrid rather than caramelised, as well as cooling the pan down.  Allow the steaks to rest after cooking If the blood of the steaks seep all over the plate when you cut into it, you probably donapost give it enough time to rest. This is important, according to dad-to-three Mr Wareing. He says: Never eat a steak hot – remove from the pan and let it rest for a good five to ten minutes, then when you slice it the blood and juices will stay in the steak and be perfect. The chef, who is in his youth was an amateur boxer, has outlined some other secrets. In the book, he writes: Place the steak in the pan and then leave it for a couple of minutes”, the chef says.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailTwins Denise and Charlotte Murray were constant companions – but that didn’t suit control freak Johnny Miller. And everything changed soon after Charlotte fell under his influence at the age of . She moved away from her home town to live with him. And within a year she was dead. Chef Miller, , pretended his fiancée had disappeared but was ­convicted of her murder after a long police investigation. As he awaits a le sentence, he refuses to tell officers how he killed Charlotte or where he disposed of her body. Tonight her twin Denise, , spoke of the family’s agony at not knowing what happened. She said: “We can’t come to terms with it. We can’t move on because we don’t have the end of the story. “We have no grave to visit. We have nowhere to go and say a prayer and leave flowers.” Denise will never forget the beginning of the ordeal that led to discovering her sister’s death. It began with her waking from a restless sleep one night. “I felt like I was being choked and like someone had thrown something in my face,” she said. “I sat there coughing and spluttering in the dark, panicked because I couldn’t breathe. “When I got my breath back I just lay there, frightened, and the nerves of it stayed with me for a few days. I was anxious and emotional and I couldn’t figure out why.  “Nothing like that had ever happened to me before.” Denise believes the night it happened in November  could have been the night Charlotte was killed. Police think her sister was murdered about then. At the trial last October, prosecution lawyers said Miller killed his fiancée in a ­“murderous rage” and that on the morning of her disappearance she had sent him explicit images of herself with his friend. The court heard that he later went ­online looking to buy an axe, a saw and cleaning materials. Jurors rejected his claim that he bought them as a Christmas gt for his father.  And his story that she had moved away to start a new le was “riddled with ­inconsistencies, inaccuracies and lies”. The jury took three hours toa unanimous guilty verdict at Northern Ireland’s crown court, Dungannon. Denise said: “Right through the trial Miller maintained that Charlotte could still be alive. “It was horrendous. I’ve known for a long time she’s gone and the police have too. “Miller saying that made the whole ordeal worse. “We were terried he might lead the jury down the garden path to believe she wasn’t dead. Thankfully they saw through his lies.” Charlotte and Denise were born on Christmas Day , numbers six and seven in a family of . Charlotte arrived first.  “She was always the boss,” says Denise. “She was born two minutes before me and that’s the way it continued. “We were tomboys, ­always in the thick of things. Playing in the mud, climbing trees and because we were a pair we never needed anyone . We always had each other and we felt each other’s pain. “She put weight on when I was pregnant and she felt it when I was in labour.  “We had the same scars on our hands and our foreheads too.” Charlotte lived most of her le near her mother and siblings in Omagh, Co Tyrone.  But within months of meeting Miller through work in late  she moved more than  miles to live with him in the town of Moy. “She seemed besotted with him,” said Denise. “But none of us had met him. We didn’t even know where ­exactly she lived to go and visit.” It turned out none of the family had seen Charlotte for months before she died. “We’d met all of her previous boyfriends. The suddenly she’d upped and left with someone none of us knew,” said Denise.  “We should have made more of a fuss about it but we didn’t want to upset her because things could be tricky with Charlotte sometimes. I think now that he was controlling her. Denise and Charlotte fell out over a petty row in March  and never spoke again. “I thought it would blow over,” said mum-of-two Denise. “But with her being away, and me being busy with the kids, before we got a chance to make it up, it was too late.” The family became increasingly worried so they contacted Miller who agreed to meet Denise and one of her brothers in March . “Miller told us she’d got a loan out and a new passport, and he made out like she’d gone off on holiday without telling anyone. “At that time we believed him. We were actually annoyed that she’d gone off without a word to any of us. I feel so gullible now, and sickened that I bought his lies. We reported her missing that May.”  With another Christmas ­behind her – and another birthday she should have shared with her sister – Denise is fighting to stay positive that a clue will lead them to Charlotte’s grave. “In birthday cards from my brothers and sisters, they always address them to me and Charlotte because it’s not just my birthday. It’s lovely that she is never forgotten. It’s as much her birthday as it as mine.” A new law in England will soon deny murderers parolethey refuse to reveal the location of their victim’s remains. But as yet there are no such plans in Northern Ireland for a version of Helen’s Law – named after Helen McCourt, , who was killed by publican Ian Simms in .  “We’ll fight for that too,” said Denise. “We need that equivalent law, one we want to call Charlotte’s Law in Northern Ireland because leaving ­families in this state is cruel. “I’m lost without her. We all are. It’s so hard for my mum.It feels like sometimes when she looks at me she sees Charlotte.

Because Shanice, , who has cystic fibrosis, was the first person in Britain to have her le saved by a set of lungs in a box. The ground-breaking medical invention has now saved  lives worldwide by keeping removed donor organs “breathing” while they are transported for transplant. And the OCS – Organ Care System – can even improve lungs not considered good enough for transplant, like those in Shanice’s chest. They had been ­rejected by four transplant centres when they arrived in front of surgeon Marius Berman at the Royal Papworth in Cambridge in November . q He realised the OCS box could make the lungs of a -year-old donor ­usable again – and Shanice, of Darlington, Co Durham, got the call. She’d been on the transplant list since April  as CF ravaged her body. By November, after marrying welder Robert Moncur, she was running out of le. “In my wedding photos I can see my collar bones sticking out – I’m ft ins and I was just over st,” she says. “It was a lovely day but I was so weak. Soon I needed oxygen every night to sleep.” Three ­-mile dashes to Papworth that summer ended in vain when donor lungs were deemed unsuitable.  Then came the fourth call. Lung and heart transplant surgeon Marius believed he could make this trip worth it using the machine that mimics the body, breathing oxygen into the lungs and feeding them with blood.It also allows doctors to ­assess and eliminate infection, excess fluid and any clotting. “When we have the lungs in the box we can test them thoroughly,” says Marius, . “And do things that will raise their quality. “The UK has one of the sickest donor populations in Europe. Fteen per cent of all organs are not usable. And for lungs it’s worse.  “So the only way forward is to try to get the best out of every set we get. “Sometimes it’s clear lungs aren’t suitable but often we are looking at organs we would call ‘marginal’. “If you have the box you can do things to make them useful. Without the transplant that day, it would have been highly unlikely the patient would have lived much longer.” Shanice only learned her case was a UK first after surgery. “I Googled the box and was wowed by how clever it was,” she said. “When I found my lungs would have otherwise gone to waste I was amazed. I’m so grateful to the medical staff and the donor and his family.  “Within a few months I was doing things I’d never done – going out with friends more, walking the dogs and exercise classes. It saved and changed my le.” Since Shanice’s op, a further four successful transplants have ­already been carried out using the box.  It is made by a US firm called TransMedics, which has also ­pioneered devices for liver and heart transplants. The company has agreed to fund the OCS – which adds around £, to the £, cost of a lung transplant – for the next year. After that, it is hoped NHS England will fund it.

The general, head of the ­aerospace ision of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, said: “I wish I could die and not ­witness such an accident.” His admission came as a fourth British victim was named as -year-old Arad Zarei, from London, who had been visiting his mum in Iran. Iranian officials had spent days denying responsibility for downing the Kiev-bound Flight PS just moments after it left Tehran on Wednesday. They accused the US of spreading malicious propaganda and lies about the crash which happened just hours after an Iranian missile blitz on US and British bases in Iraq. But officials said they had mistaken the jetliner for a cruise missile and only had ten seconds to decide whether or not to open fire. Last night the EU Aviation Safety Agency urged airlines to avoid all Iranian airspace. And Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for the victims to be identied ­immediately following a telephone call with Iran’s president Hassan Rouhani. The general’s admission sparked demos in Tehran, with demands for the resignation of Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  Large protests were reported at four universities in the capital, with chants of “shameless”, “death to liars” and “down with the dictator”. Police retaliated with tear gas.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “We now need a ­comprehensive, transparent and independent international investigation.“This tragic accident only ­reinforces the importance of de-escalating tensions.

Some things you might get away with when it’s more open, you don’t.“Inverness were good at it last week. They sit with six players behind the ball and maybe cheat with a couple up the park and counter you well.“We need to find the answers to open teams up.”Dundee’s form going into last weekend’s clash with Caley Thistle was good with two wins and two draws in their previous four.However, consistency has consistently been the downfall for the Dark Blues this season.That four-game spell in December was their best since August and Hemmings knows it’s something the team have to improve on.He added: “We’re tired talking about it, to be honest.“We’ve had moments where we think we’re getting there and we’re away on a good run but have games like Inverness last week.“We can’t just do it for three or four games but we need seven or eight in a row to really assert ourselves.“The performances going back to the second half against Arbroath had been really good.“We’ve been positive in the way we’ve played, some good performances.“Last week was a chance to close the gap on Inverness and go level on points with them. It was disappointing in that regard.“This will be another big game because Ayr are a good team and we need to pick ourselves back up.”Tomorrow’s clash comes after tests against league leaders Dundee United, second-placed Inverness and ahead of a dficult Scottish Cup tie at home to high-flying Premiership side Motherwell.It’s a testing run for the players but Hemmings is relishing the chance to get back out and into a big match.He said: “It is good to have another big game this weekend.“We knew there were three big home games in a row with the Scottish Cup the week after.“That’s what you want – you always want to test yourself as a player.“It’s a good game to jump back into.”The last meeting with Ayr saw Dundee leave Somerset Park with an impressive - victory.

But there’s genuinely nothing imminent.”Despite no incomings being imminent, James is keen for fans of the club not to take that for inaction behind the scenes.He added: “We don’t want six or seven signings every window.

Its dog-eared pages contain neatly-typed records, precise drawings and fascinating photographs.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun#, #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar. Club secretary Jenner Rollands contacted the Advertiser and confirmed CCC sadly lost all its records when the Carrick, moored on the River Clyde, sank in . At the time, the club#s office was aboard her.Closer to home, Ardrishaig man Billy Paterson called into the Advertiser offices to say his father, Ardrishaig Primary School headmaster Gilbert Paterson, had crewed the yacht Fulmar.Mr Paterson still has mementoes from his father#s trips in the form of gts from Commander Mowat, including a paperweight from , a copper and brass barrel ashtray dated  and a brass model yacht with #Fulmar # engraved on it.Thanks to everyone who contacted the Advertiser with their memories.We now know a little more about Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , owner of the Fulmar.Details about the crew of #Tanky#, #Bosun# and #Pilot# remain, however, sketchy, soanyone out there knows any more#"},{"url":null,"title":"my new year resolution is","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards"},{"url":null,"title":"plenty of christmas room at the inn","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowInveraray Senior Citizens committee hosted its annual Christmas lunch in the Inveraray Inn.The event, on Sunday December  for senior citizens of Inveraray, was well attended with everyone enjoying a delicious meal and musical entertainment provided by Lochgilphead#s Easy Club.During the festivities, the committee presented flowers to Diane MacDonald, who is retiring from the committee after nine years."},{"url":null,"title":"a mid argyll rugby blast from the past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Donald Carmichael handed in this black and white photograph of a Mid Argyll Rugby Club team of many decades ago.But can our readers name the players  And what background can you give us about this photograph and Mid Argyll Rugby club at the time Contact the Argyllshire Advertiser by email: editor@argyllshireadvertiser with any information."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event. And to Gavin #Top Tog# Brown, who has been an avid rally man for years and continued to watch us all through the lens, capturing some of our most heroic moments. was a busy year, with a few of us still tinkering away in sheds.  will hopefully see theof Ally and Del Galbraith in their #new# MK Escort and Donald Bowness in the giant killing Nova making aafter some time out.PICS:Dougie Watt and Ian Parker flying in Finland before winning in Aberdeen Photo: Jii Pihlaja. no_a_RallyFinlandFather and son duo Craig and Ross Callendar came in th overall at this year#s Mull Rally.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the latest in a series of important milestones that have brought us a step closer to progressing plans for sustainable economic development."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-test-rocket-engines-former-cockenzie-power-station-site-rejected","story":"Skyrorarsquos bid to set up a base on where the sitersquos former coal handling plant stood had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application.

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration. Whatever your faith or spirituality, whatever your family or cultural traditions, I wish you a Happy New Year and I look forward to theof the sun, and sharing with you new adventures of discovery in our beautul county."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-youngsters-thank-lifeboat-crew-saving-lives","story":"Rachel Pirie and Luke Foster, both , were exploring the townrsquos clfs with Chloe McCaw, , at about noon on November  last year when the incident happened.The rising water levels left the youngsters, who all live in Dunbar and attend Dunbar Grammar School, cut off with no food, no water and one working mobile phone that did not have any credit.Police and Coastguard crews struggled to locate them.Talking about their ordeal, Rachel said: ldquoWe know the area well and the tide was well out so we thought we were safe.

I was alone and deep in thought. I cannot remember now exactly what the issue was, but something had happened that seemed to be unfair, and it had made me angry.It was a windy and cold day. The tide was in and the waves rolling and crashing created a kind of meditative sound. I donrsquot know how long I sat there, as time seemed to dissolve as I listened to the sea, and smelt the salt air.Later I walked by the shore, again alone, and I remember how my mood had changed.My memory of that day fades at this point: I cannot recall what happened as I ed home. But clearly the sea had done its job in calming my emotional state.Memories are not like books on a shelf which we can take out and look at, and then . Our memories are really about emotions rather than happenings. We connect to the emotions first, our brain then does a search for the events associated with the emotion. Songs, smell, sounds and places can trigger emotion which then leads to associations with actual events.So itrsquos the emotion attached to events which will mark it as signicant. Thatrsquos why we remember the unusual moments more than the everyday ones. We remember the events when our emotions were aroused, either positively or negatively.That day I was angry. The sea was pretty much on our doorstep, so it was probably an obvious place to go to be alone, away from my siblings, to rage at the injustice I felt. But it was a good choice, because the sea has a powerful ability to heal.There seems to be a sense by some that the sea is a place to go only when itrsquos sunny and warm. In fact, the gts of the sea are given all year round, and it is winter time, or a time of storm and wind, that the sea becomes a powerful place to find naturersquos healing.How lucky we are to live in a county where we have  miles of coastline, much of it close to communities and accessible. Those with a sense of adventure and physical ability to do so can find parts of the coast to themselves, even in busy times.But as I learnt all those years ago, the sea can speak to us directly. Simply sitting by it, or walking along the shore while sharing our thoughts, can be a powerful form of mental as well as physical healing.Some take this a step further by bathing in the sea on a regular basis ndash yes, even in the winter. There are real benefits to swimming in a cold sea, both in terms of mental and physical health. But I think it helpsothers do it with you, as an encouragement! The Loony Dooks which take place at North Berwick, Dunbar and where around the coast should be a weekly event, not a yearly one!But we donrsquot need to be in the sea to feel its benefits, just by it and connected to it mentally, and yes, spiritually. This is a serious point. We have an epidemic of mental health issues, and while there is no one simple explanation or solution, we need to understand the signicance of our disconnection from nature and its impact on our mental health. Spending time by the sea is a tonic for body and mind.I think we felt this last week when we headed for the rocks at North Berwick on Boxing Day. It was here that Robert Louis Stevenson played as a boy and discovered a small cave in which he imagined tales of pirates and smugglers. The island of Fidra, said to be his inspiration for Treasure Island, can be seen further along the coast.The tide was in, so it wasnrsquot possible to see the cave. But in scrambling over the rocks, discovering other things and sitting by the waves, the sea did its magic for our family and myself. The waves were crashing andyou studied how they hit the rocks you could see how the hand of the sea had carved them in certain ways.We sat and explored there ndash not noticing the nippy wind ndash for a good hour. It was an overcast afternoon and darkness fell soon.

and other unmarked areas of the car park which were not designated bays.It was, the council said, a way to illustrate the need for additional car parking in Haddington.Now the council has confirmed it is planning to introduce new traffic regulations which will stop people from parking outside spaces in the packed car park.A spokesperson said: ldquoA report will be presented to our cabinet meeting in January with proposals to introduce double yellow lines to the long-stay car park.This is to improve safety and reduce damage to the kerbs and road surfaces caused by indiscriminate parking.ldquoFollowing cabinet, the proposals will be subject to a statutory process before the necessary regulations could be introduced.Last October, the council introduced similar restrictions in its own staff car park at John Muir House, Haddington, which lies a short distance from the long-stay facility.That saw dozens of workers receive fines, from the team of private parking wardens employed by the council, for ignoring new yellow lines in their own car park.The long-stay car park in Haddington is on land owned by East Lothian Council and accessed through the adjoining short-stay

the practice of using physical structures to protect shorelines from coastal erosion.But in Scotland it is just %.\"Today, coastal management is covered by a complex patchwork of legislation and is carried out by a iety of organisations with dferent responsibilities,\" said the report.\"Current shoreline management tends to be reacting and poorly structured in some areas and continuation of current practice will lead to coastal degradation and loss of amenity value.\"Shoreline Management Plans have the ambition to provide a structured and consistent framework and this may be better achieved when they are refreshed in coming years.\": Climate change threatens to kill off golf in the country where it was first playedProfessor Bill Austin said: ldquoThe oceans and seas that surround many of the worldrsquos top golf courses play a vital role in their future viability. Many are already seeing the impact of coastal erosion and flooding brought on by more storms and rising sea levels as a result of climate change.\"This research will allow us to consider all climate-related factors that will have an ever-lasting effect on the Home of Golf.\"Our research will also look at the blue carbon opportunities and the role of long-term carbon storage in Scotlandrsquos coastal habitats surrounding golf courses. If we can protect these carbon-rich ecosystems we can prevent the release of greenhouse gases that would otherwise contribute to global warming, support their rich bioersity and improve their resilience to future sea-level rise.Steve Isaac, sustainability director at The RA, said, ldquoThis marks our initial investment in research, education and communication projects in support of our Golf Course  initiative. We are funding these projects to develop best practice in sustainability and provide solutions to golf course managers that will help to sustain and improve the standard of golf course conditions and playability for the benefit of those who enjoy the sport.ldquoThe results of the projects being funded will contribute signicantly towards meeting the aims of Golf Course  and provide insights to the golf industry as we consider how to address the challenges and opportunities presented by a changing climate, resource constraints and regulation on golf course management."},{"url":null,"title":"kevin-mckenna-harry-meghan-can-pay-way-cant-rest-royal-family","story":"Mr and Mrs Sussexrsquos desire to become ldquofinancially independent like the common people is admirable and it surely behoves all of us who admire the Royal Familyrsquos selfless devotion to the country to help them achieve this happy state. Most of those who have become unemployed and have no immediate prospect of another secure income are compelled to introduce a measure of austerity between jobs. This shouldnrsquot be a problem for the Sussexes.The duchess brought a few million to the union following a successful acting career in the United States while Harry inherited poundm from his mother, the late Princess Diana and poundm from his dear old Granny Betty, the Queen Mother. When you throw in the annual pound.m the couple have been receiving from Prince Charles the rocky road to financial independence becomes a little less so. If this couple really are genuine about seeking financial independence as the term is understood by the rest of us then the transition from ornamental popinjays to tax-paying citizens and cutting their cloth accordingly shouldnrsquot present them with many dficulties.Andthey were to feel that a poundk estimated annual rental of their pound.m Frogmore Cottage home is a bit steep then nothingrsquos stopping them moving into a more modest home, perhaps something in the more manageable poundm category. Hell, why not push the boat out and see about taking out a mortgage  Irsquom sure also that Meghan could make a few commercials to tide them over while her husband finds his feet.Harry, like the rest of the royals, has no obvious talents and may find it dficult to source suitably paid employment by his own endeavours. This family isnrsquot exactly blessed with charisma or discernible leadership skills. And such dubious qualications wersquore all led to believe they gained on their own havenrsquot been tested in any workplace where promotion and status is gained on merit.In the UK, though, where deference, supplication and genuflection to this family is almost absolute, Harry shouldnrsquot find much dficulty in obtaining a few non-executive directorships. Just so long as hersquos not expected to exhibit flair at anything in particular. Irsquod be less confident about paid speaking engagements, mind you.The anger that this has all caused within the Royal Family is easy to understand and the corgis must be having a torrid time of it right now. The royal lackeys in the right-wing press suggest that, having granted them their multi-million pound wedding their beautul home and royal titles, the firm is aghast at Harry and Meghanrsquos ingratitude. I feel their pain. The long-term implications of the couplersquos new-found sense of freedom for the House of Windsor are seriously catastrophic. If this couple can look after themselves then why canrsquot the rest of them If you believe the UK Government, the task of extricating a nation of  million souls and thousands of laws from the European Union will take barely a year. Removing the public teat from the mouths of this gilded outfit and finding them suitable careers advice shouldnrsquot be too onerous. After that it becomes a matter of taking the assorted royal palaces and castles back into public ownership.Perhaps the younger members of the Royal Family could put their knowledge of these places to good use and become tour guides. Being a reasonable chiel Irsquod perhaps permit them to hang on to one of the royal residences and convert it into an eventide home for royal codgerdom. Irsquod only stipulate that once a year they agree to a fly-on-the-wall Christmas special for the BBC, presented by Nicholas Witchell whom Prince Charles once described as ldquothat awful man.A quantum of mince has been written about the Duchy of Cornwall, the inherited vehicle by which Prince Charles lsquoearnsrsquo his multi-million-pound income. This huge estate makes the prince the biggest landowner in England and we are asked to believe the lie that it also makes him self-sufficient. As Harry and Meghan obtain the bulk of their income from the duchy then the lie extends to them too.The Duchy of Cornwall was established in  by Edward III as a gt to his son, Edward, Prince of Wales, also known as The Black Prince. The Prince of Wales does not extract his millions from this vast landholding through any merit or talent of his own. He is able to employ squads of professionals to help him and give credence to the subsistence lie.Only the oldest surviving son of the monarch gets to use it as his own personal cash cow. No women can get their mitts on it and no Catholics either. In st century Britain we allow this family of property thieves to prevent Catholics contaminating their bloodline, unless of course they first renounce their faith.Our maintenance of this family in their palaces and their multi-million pound lestyles mocks any pretensions this country has to values of equality, justice and honesty. For how can we proclaim these virtues and propel our young people towards them when we permit medieval feudalism and grievous discrimination to flourish at the heart of British society We always want the next generation to learn from the mistakes of past ones and to become better than us. This, though, becomes a pointless exercise when we seem to celebrate and bow down to the Royal Family and its ancient, unearned privileges. Here, mediocrity is rewarded entitlement is encouraged and true merit is scorned.If Prince Harry and Meghan Markel genuinely want to decouple from this seedy fiefdom then I wish them every success. The nation wonrsquot be convinced, though, until we see a set of accounts that doesnrsquot include income from the civil list or the spoils of th century conquest. And until we lose the rest of them Britain will never be entitled to call itself a modern, civilised country."},{"url":null,"title":"tom-gordon-scottish-labours-position-worse-thought","story":"A Wisden-like slew of statistics, itrsquos invaluable for shining a light on the overlooked details of the result.The latest contains some fascinating nuggets about the  vote in Scotland, especially about Labourrsquos fortunes.The partyrsquos Scottish executive, which meets in Glasgow today to discuss its response to that thrashing, might want a stf drink before reading it.For Scottish Labourrsquos result is even worse than it looked at first glance.The headlines were the loss of six of seven MPs, saved from a total wipe-out by Ian Murray in Edinburgh South, and its vote share falling from . per cent to .%, putting it third behind the Tories.While Labour only just came third in , it was decisively beaten by the Tories in , the gap between the two widening from . to . per cent.But look deeper and you really see how far the party has sunk.There have been five general elections in Scotland on the same boundaries, so some gruesome trends are discernible.In  and , Labour won  and  of Scotlandrsquos  seats with vote shares of .% and .% respectively.Many of the safest Labour seats in the UK were then in Scotland.

Tony Blairrsquos majority in Sedgefield was only the third largest.In every Scottish seat, Labour candidates always polled at least %The SNP tsunami of  obviously changed that, but not just by washing away every Labour MP bar Mr Murray.There was new phenomenon.Labour effectively became electorally irrelevant in several Scottish seats.Candidates started losing deposits for the first time in decades.Labour lost three deposits - after polling less than % - across the entire UK in . All three were in Scotland.Labourrsquos share of the vote also fell below % in a dozen Scottish seats.The picture briefly improved in Mr Corbynrsquos half-decent loss of .There were no lost deposits in the UK, and Labourrsquos vote share was down to single figures in only three Scottish seats.But last month those worrying trends for Labour reasserted themselves.In , Labour won m votes in Scotland. Last month it was half that.The party lost  deposits across the UK. Seven were in Scotland.Its vote fell in all  Scottish seats, and went below % in  - single figure support in a third of the country.The Tories also lost seats and vote share in Scotland. But in only two seats did they drop into single figures, and there were no lost deposits.The SNP, which had an overall vote share of %, only fell below % in a single seat, Mr Murrayrsquos, and even there they managed a respectable .%.Labourrsquos vote was squeezed left, right and centre. It lost deposits in seats won by the SNP, the Tories and LibDems.It previous supporters abandoned it to vote tactically or just plain abandoned it.In Dumfries  Galloway, which it won in  with .% of the vote, Labour was down to a humbling .%.In large parts of Scotland, Labour is disappearing from the electoral map.A fallen giant, its carcass is being systematically stripped clean by other parties scavenging for votes.So what to do  Scottish leader Richard Leonard has announced he is leading a review of the election, with the party told to expect some ldquohard lessons.Herersquos a hard lesson for him. He should step aside from the review because hersquos part of the problem.In two colourless years as leader, he has lost both his MEPs, six of his MPs, andhe carries on as before, a good lot of his MSPs in  as well.He has just not connected with voters.He never tried to step out of Mr Corbynrsquos shadow. Worse, he seems more fired up by Labour party history than your tomorrow.Irsquove yet to hear his big vision for Scotland in the st century. But Irsquove lost count of his reveries about Mary Barbour and the Glasgow rent strikes of  years ago, or eulogies for Keir Hardie and other sepia-tinted ghosts.Itrsquos a comfort blanket. Therersquos not a single vote in any of it. Not one.The review will also cover the partyrsquos ldquoconstitutional offer. This boils down to whether it supports a second referendum on independence.Mr Leonard was initially opposed to Indyref, then caved in to Mr Corbyn and John McDonnell when they said Labour shouldnrsquot stand in the way of it.But now party members may be asked whether to actively embrace Indyref, as the outgoing general secretary of the STUC, Grahame Smith, has advised.There has been some harking back to the s, when Labourrsquos offer was a Scottish Parliament subject to a referendum. Back then the party was behind both the end and the means.However for Scottish Labour to back Indyref, but not back independence, would be a far harder trick to pull off.Hence Mr Leonard floating the idea of a multiple-choice referendum, with independence and devo max or federalism against the status quo.This might seem like a clever fudge.The SNP and Greens would back independence in such a scenario, Labour and the LibDems more devolution, leaving the Tories as the party offering Scotland an empty plate.But would voters really be bowled over by it  Ever greater devolution is already the direction of travel for Holyrood. The public expects it.Presenting it as a great leap forward requiring yet another trip to the polls is unlikely to earn much thanks.The setting up of Holyrood was a huge change. Independence obviously would be. But more powers Federalism would also require parallel devolution in Englandrsquos regions. Scottish Labour canrsquot guarantee that.Kezia Dugdale tried it, touting a ldquonew Act of Union as a federal riposte to independence. It sank without trace.Then there are the mechanics of a three-way vote, and the row over them.A first-past-the-post system could, in theory, deliver independencejust over a third of voters backed it. Under the single transferable vote, it could win out with even fewer first preferences.In the end, the need for a clear and authoritative result would make a re-run of rsquos binary choice between independence or the Union inevitable.Labour members shouldnrsquot be gulled into thinking there is a soft third-way optionIndyref ever comes to pass.Nicola Sturgeon doesnrsquot want Devo Max on the ballot. A decade ago, it might have seemed akin to a win for SNP, but not after Brexit. A Devo Max Scotland would still be outside the EU.In the panicky aftermath of defeat, a new constitutional offer might seem a key step in Scottish Labourrsquos recovery. But its problems are not so easily fixed.Its fall owes more to socio-economic and demographic change eroding its base and a decade of inadequate leadership both sides of the border.Ed Miliband and Jeremy Corbyn couldnrsquot cut it. Iain Gray and Johann Lamont couldnrsquot dent Alex Salmond, and Ms Dugdale and Mr Leonard have been no match for Nicola Sturgeon.Scottish Labourrsquos best hope is an electable UK leader who can earn the party a second look from voters.Adopting a new position on Indyref didnrsquot help Mr Corbyn and it wonrsquot make a winner out of Mr Leonard."},{"url":null,"title":"300-mile-route-via-dumfries-ayr-new-north-coast-500","story":"But now tourism bosses are turning the spotlight on the south-west of Scotland in the latest Route -style campaign to lure visitors to the regionrsquos beauty spots.The campaign by Visit South West Scotlandaims to raise awareness of the circular -mile South West Coastal touring route through Dumfries and Galloway and South Ayrshire.The SWV was designed by Motorcycle Scotland and adapted by tourist chiefs to take in more local attractions.: North Coast  taken over by Scotlands biggest landownerThe road trip takes in the south-west coastline from Ayr to Cairngaan via Stranraer and Portpatrick, before passing along the south of Scotland through Wigtown, Kirkcudbright and Castle Douglas, then heading inland to Dumfries.From there the remainder of the route loops round via Lockerbie, Moffat, Sanquhar, New Cumnock, Dalmellington and Maybole.The new digital campaign, funded with pound, from VisitScotland, is geared to making visitors ldquofall in love with south-west Scotland by showcasing aspects of the route which offer particular appeal to the key target markets such as its scenery, wildle and adventure sports.Ian McAndrew, chairman of Visit South West Scotland, said: ldquoThe south-west of Scotland is a special place, it has so much to offer, especially to lovers of the great outdoors and that is a message we are working hard to get out there.ldquoAs a trade organisation, collaboration is at the core of what we do, we rely on our members and our strategic partners to get behind our efforts to make a real dference to tourism in the South West.ldquoTherefore when VisitScotland agreed to support our promotional campaign for the South West Coastal , a touring route that encourages visitors to explore our region, we were delighted.Tourist bosses will market the SWC Touring Road Route to the rest of the UK and Ireland in an online drive featuring short films, images and itineraries, and promotional activity on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram by ldquoinfluencers ndash people with tens of thousands of social media followers.They expect the campaign to reach more than , people via social media and at least double traffic to the South West Coastal  landing page on the VSWS website.: Burns worth over poundm to Scottish economyPaula Ward, VisitScotland Regional Leadership Director, said: ldquoWith its stunning coastal and inland landscapes, peaceful atmosphere and fantastic attractions, the south-west of Scotland is a great visitor destination and the SWC is the perfect route for experiencing it.ldquoIrsquom thrilled we were able to support this exciting new campaign and I canrsquot wait to see the outputs.ldquoAt VisitScotland we want to champion collaboration, spearhead digital innovation and promote local areas to make sure every part of Scotland enjoys the benefits of tourism.The latest tourism drive comes after the success of the North Coast , which was developed as a way to bring visitors to hidden parts of the Scottish Highlands and give economic benefits to struggling communities.The -mile route ndash dubbed Scotlandrsquos answer to Route , the famous US highway linking Chicago to Santa Monica ndash was essentially a rebranding of an existing system of roads that had been around for decades.It begins at Inverness Castle before heading north to John OrsquoGroats and looping back around along the north-west coast via Durness, Lochinver and Applecross.It takes in breathtaking countryside, including the infamous hairpin bends of the Bealach na Ba, secluded northern beaches, distilleries, smokehouses and farm shops, and was recently named the most spectacular drive in the UK.Visitors can have their NC ldquopassport stamped at attractions along the route.Its twisting single-track road have proven particularly popular with cyclists and motorists, including the owners of supercars, although residents living along the route have complained that its popularity was causing disruption.

Only a few acts of political murder ever shaped the world in any meaningful way.Scotlandrsquos most infamous act of political killing ndash the assassination of James I ndash is a perfect example. It was tawdry butchery which had little lasting impact on the future of the country.As the reign of his father, Robert III, came to an end, family intrigue put young James at risk as heir to the throne. En route to France and safety, James was captured by pirates and handed over to the English king Henry IV. He remained a hostage for  years but became close to English royals. He ed to Scotland in  but his rule was fractious.In , conspirators attacked James and his English we, Joan, in Perth. James tried to escape but was trapped in a sewer and kned to death. His we, though, fled, and their six-year-old son was crowned James II a month after the assassination.By contrast, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by Bosnian nationalist Gavrilo Princip on June , , led directly to the outbreak of the First World War.Today, the worldrsquos attention is focused on another assassination ndash the killing of Iranrsquos General Qasem Soleimani on the orders of President Donald Trump. Will it be a meaningless killing that changes little and which the world quickly forgets, or will it shape the course of human history Only time will tell. But understanding what caused some of the most notorious acts of assassination in history, and the effects of those killings, might help us hazard a guess at what the future holds when it comes to the consequences of the Soleimani killing.Brother versus brotherLetrsquos start at the beginning. Cain and Abel can be seen as a political killing. Biblical scholars and anthropologists now think the story might hold clues about the deep past of human history. Cain was a farmer, Abel was a shepherd. When the pair made offerings to God ndash Cain with crops and Abel with lambs ndash it was Abelrsquos gt which pleased God. Cain felt slighted and murdered his brother, and was cast out from society.Some scholars suggest the story is symbolic of the violent clash between nomadic herdsmen, like Abel, and a new breed of people ndash stationary farmers who had developed agriculture, like Cain. Agriculture led to cities and monarchy. So, this story of fratricidal assassination may tell of one of the most signicant, but unrecorded moments, in human history: the sht from a hunter-gather lestyle to civilisation as we know it.Biblical beheadingsThe Bible also contains the story of one of the most daring assassinations ever ndash the killing of the Assyrian military commander Holofernes by the Jewish heroine Judith. Of course, as with much in the Bible therersquos no proof it happened ndash nevertheless the story marks one of the first accounts of assassination having direct consequences on the political world.In the story, the Assyrians, led by Holofernes, are terrorising the Israelites. Judith, a beautul widow, goes to the Assyrian camp and charms Holofernes, getting him drunk and promising him intelligence on the Israelites. Holofernes passes out and Judith cuts his head off. The Assyrians flee and Israel is saved.Knives out in RomeThe most famous assassination in history came in BC when conspiratorial Roman nobles stabbed Julius Caesar to death. Caesar had been named ldquoPerpetual Dictator just a few months earlier and it seemed the Roman Republic was about to end. How much the assassination really changed ordinary Roman le is debatable, but it ensured that Caesar was on the winning side of history even in death. The doomed republic wasnrsquot saved. Caesarrsquos heir, Augustus, became the first emperor. All emperors, from then on, would be known as Caesar.Assassinations of emperors became routine. With each political murder little changed substantively. Over  years, some % of Romersquos  emperors were assassinated. Caligula was only the third emperor to rule. His reign was one of cruelty and sadism. Eventually, his own bodyguard cut him to pieces. Caligula was succeeded by his uncle Claudius ndash who was probably assassinated by his we Agrippina so that her son Nero could assume the title. Agrippina in turn was eventually killed on the orders of Nero.Killer gangsRome also prompted the creation of one of the first assassin organisations in history ndash the Sicarii, a word which today lends itself to the Latin American term sicario, a drug cartel hitman. The Sicarii were Jewish rebels fighting the Roman occupation of Judea, and they perfected the art of close-up killing of high-profile targets in broad daylight.The spirit of the Sicarii lived on in the organisation which gives us the word assassin ndash the Islamic secret society known as the Hashashiyan. The name most likely derives from hashish as followers of the organisation are said to have used the drug. This order of assassins was set up around  and would spread terror among European Crusaders, striking at will from mountain fortresses in Persia and Syria. They were masters of guerrilla warfare, and political murder.The original assassins were similar to the medieval Japanese Ninjas, also known as Shinobi. The first ninja was the semi-legendary Prince Yamoto Takeru who dressed up as a beautul young female servant to get close to two targets he intended to assassinate. In Japan, such tactics were seen as dishonourable and beneath the dignity of Samurai knights.Religious murderIn Europe, the medieval era was a time of Christian zealotry and conflict so itrsquos no surprise that assassination in the Middle Ages took on a distinctly religious flavour. Henry III of France was killed by a fanatical monk in , and Henry IV of France was killed by what we would today term a Catholic ldquoterrorist in  after numerous failed assassination attempts. The Dutch protestant Prince of Orange, William the Silent, was also killed because of his religious beliefs, shot in the chest at close range by a French Catholic, Balthasar Gerard, in .Gerardrsquos execution was particularly gruesome: his hand was burned off, the flesh torn from his bones with pincers, he was quartered and disembowelled alive, his heart was torn from his chest and flung in his face and finally he was beheaded. The execution came after days of torture. Of course, despite these assassinations shaking the foundations of Europe, they altered little the course of the continentrsquos wars and religious conflicts.The most infamous religious assassination of the medieval era took place in England, with the murder of the Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas agrave Becket in . Becket had been a friend of King Henry II before he took office. Henry wanted the monarchy to have more control over the church, but when Becket became Archbishop he supported the Pope.An infuriated Henry was overheard by a number of loyal knights saying of Becket: ldquoWill no-one rid me of this turbulent priest  The knights took it upon themselves to butcher Becket inside Canterbury Cathedral ndash an act so blasphemous it shook European society to its core. Becket became one of Englandrsquos most important saints and Henry had to humble himself before the church in penance. In the wake of the assassination, nothing substantively changed in terms of the relationship between the church and monarchy in England.Elizabeth I was subject to plenty of assassination plots during the troubled religious period she ruled, but it was her successor James who survived perhaps the most audacious assassination plan in history ndash the  Gunpowder Plot. If Robert Catesby, Guy Fawkes and the rest of their Catholic conspirators hadnrsquot been caught, the assassination would have taken out the entire government. Instead, the plot was foiled, the rebels executed, and the rights of Catholics were even more restricted than before. It took a further  years before the coming of Catholic emancipation.Political killing grows upThe modern era made political murder much easier. Assassins didnrsquot need to get up close and personal to their heavily guarded targets, thanks to bombs, bullets, and sniper rles.America perfected assassination as the art of politics via murder. Four presidents died at the hands of assassins. Abraham Lincoln was killed by the Confederate extremist John Wilkes Booth ndash shot at point blank range in the head in . President James Garfield was killed by a mentally ill assassin, and William McKinley by an anarchist.The assassination of John F Kennedy in  ushered in a new era of political murder in America, which saw leaders deemed as the brightest lights of the progressive movement killed in cold blood. Bobby Kennedy followed his brother to the grave when a Palestinian gunman, Sirhan Sirhan, shot him dead while running for the Democratic nomination for president in June . The killer was motivated by Kennedyrsquos support for Israel.A few months before, civil rights leader Martin Luther King was killed by a sniper at a Tennessee motel. James Earl Ray was eventually convicted of the assassination, but many believe Ray didnrsquot act alone and there was a conspiracy to kill the man who represented the hopes of African-Americans.These killings certainly scarred American society, but did they change American politics  Kennedyrsquos successor Lyndon Johnson, for example, stuck to a political programme pretty similar to JFKrsquos, and the civil rights movement didnrsquot lose momentum with Kingrsquos death. However, Bobby Kennedyrsquos assassination probably did change the course of history. Would he have taken the Democratic nomination and beaten Republican Richard Nixon, who won in   Many think yes. No Nixon, no Watergate.Throughout the th century world leaders fell like ninepins to assassinsrsquo bullets, with India almost as traumatised by political murder as America. Gandhi, the father of the Indian nation, was murdered by a Hindu extremist in . Indiarsquos first female prime minister, Indira Gandhi, was assassinated by Sikh extremists in . Her politician son, Rajiv, was also killed in .Soon it seemed no leader was safe ndash not even the Pope. A Turkish hitman opened fire on Pope John Paul II in .Britain has only lost one prime minister to an assassinrsquos bullet ndash Spencer Perceval who was shot by a disgruntled businessman in . However, the UK has lost plenty of top politicians to assassins. The Irish National Liberation Army killed the Conservative MP Airey Neave, a close friend and mentor of Margaret Thatcher, with a car bomb at the House of Commons in . The same year the IRA killed Lord Mountbatten with a bomb in his fishing boat. Mountbatten was the uncle of Prince Philip, former chief of defence staff and the last viceroy of India. In , the IRArsquos Brighton bomb attack killed five including Sir Anthony Berry MP. These audacious killings all hardened Thatcherrsquos determination to defeat the IRA and led to the intensication of the Northern Ireland Troubles.Wartime assassinationOf course, Irish republicans argued that they were at war and British leaders were so-called ldquolegitimate targets. It is during periods of conflict that assassination comes into its own and produces some of the most spectacular acts of political violence the world has seen.During the Cold War assassination was part of the toolbox. The CIA infamously plotted time and again to assassinate Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Bulgariarsquos version of the KGB assassinated defector Georgi Markov in the middle of London, with a stab from a poisoned umbrella tip. Britain and Russia plotted to kill Hitler during the Second World War, and MI trained the Czech commandos who assassinated one of Nazi Germanyrsquos most brutal leaders, Reinhard Heydrich, architect of the Holocaust.Today, Russia assassinates enemies of the Kremlin whether they are Chechens targeted abroad, or dissident spies like Alexander Litvinenko poisoned with polonium in London. Israel has also long used assassination as part of its military and foreign policy, most famously in the wake of the Munich Olympics massacre. After the Palestinian terror group Black September killed  Israeli athletes in , prime minister Golda Meir authorised Operation Wrath of God which assassinated targets connected to the atrocity wherever they were.These assassinations in the midst of conflict mostly hamper enemy operations, weakening their leadership and draining resolve and resources, rather than signicantly altering the course of the conflict. The killing of Markov didnrsquot end the Cold War, it embarrassed the West. Heydrichrsquos death didnrsquot defeat Nazism or slow the Holocaust. Operation Wrath of God didnrsquot end conflict between Israel and Palestine.And so we come full circle to the death of General Qasem Soleimani. All we know is that there will be consequences, but what they will be it is too soon to say. It could drain American power in the Middle East. It could increase the strength of Iran. It could spark a regional conflict. It could seriously hamper the fight against Islamic State. It could also lead to renewed negotiations, and a slim chance of a thaw in relations.We donrsquot yet knowwersquore living through a moment like the murder of James I which changed little about the world, or a moment like the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand which changed everything."},{"url":null,"title":"rab-mcneil-sands-time-message-history-visitors-outer-space","story":"First, there were the Finns.

All the talk about freedom, sovereignty, civil rights, this liberty, that liberty and parliamentary politics generally is just froth. All that really matters is the economy, by which is meant profiting from the labour of others. Threaten that with strikes or shorter days and you will feel hellip The Wrath.But thatrsquos old hat.

Itrsquos deeply felt that this is a natural law. I remember, about  years ago, a group of Danes coming to our then workplace and being appalled by the long, macho hours and presenteeism, all of which was just stretching out incompetence.Our bemused visitors could sense this right away. Longer hours did not mean that more got done.

But I havenrsquot time to go into that here.Stirring wordsITrsquoS time for a wee declaration. A Declaration of Arbroath, that is.

Scottish people, meanwhile, will worry what effect it might have on their pensions and whether it might not be better just to keep sending our money south and getting some of it back every year.The truth is out thereFOR some time now, hopes have started to fade that there might be aliens out there who could come and save us from ourselves.

There was no internet, no phone line and only the warm welcome of their new North Uist neighbours to chase away fears that relocating to a west coast island with a -months-old baby may have been a mistake.Yet, she insists, therersquos no better place to raise Elsie, now three, and her two-year-old brother, Henry.ldquoThere are plenty of children here, says Durie, . A primary school teacher who specialises in outdoor learning, she is helping nursery schools across the Uists increase capacity by introducing outdoor classroom space.ldquoIf all the children across the Uists were to take up their free childcare entitlement, the nurseries wouldnrsquot have the capacity, she points out.Around  miles across the Sea of the Hebrides in Eigg, former music journalist Sarah Boden, , has quit city le for sheep farming and raising son Arlo, four, and -months-old Ness with her musician partner Johnny Lynch, , on the island where she grew up.Two years ago, news of a babyrsquos birth on Eigg made national headlines after its arrival pushed the number of residents over  for the first time in the islandrsquos recent history. Ness was one of three babies born last year and another is due in April while a new family with two children is set to arrive in April.ldquoPart of the attraction is the people here, says Boden. ldquoItrsquos egalitarian, everyone has a similar standard of living which contributes to the community bond.ldquoIn summer therersquos so much going on. People are attracted to Eigg for its music events while in winter itrsquos more community-focused.But there are serious issues that young families have to consider, she warns. For example, the closest secondary schoolrsquos location in Mallaig means children leave Eigg for two weeks at a time to board on the mainland.ldquoThe doctor comes every Tuesday, sothe children have a raging temperature you just have to work around it, she adds. ldquoItrsquos part and parcel of living here.Eiggrsquos population boom is being attributed in part to the  community buyout. ldquoThings are happening now, says Maggie Fyffe, secretary of the Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust. The island is a bit more exciting than it used to be and that has attracted young people back.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful place to raise children. People donrsquot have the same kind of lsquostranger dangerrsquo, parents can let their children out the door and not worry.ldquoThe children know everyone and they are never excluded. If therersquos a ceilidh, the children come too.ldquoBut the lack of housing is a big problem.It all sounds buoyant, yet recent statistics have made grim reading.The number of babies born last year at the Western Isles hospital is said to have slumped to  compared to  four years before, and in the past  years, a dozen of the  islands of the Outer Hebrides have become officially uninhabited.Projections suggest a % population decline for Lewis and Harris by , while ndash despite evidence of the baby boom ndash Barra is supposedly braced for a % slide in its numbers.It has been suggested that the Western Islesrsquo overall population will fall from , in  to , by  ndash a projected decline of , people over the -year period.According to Theona Morrison, founder and Director of CoDel, a project which supports enterprise and young people, statistics and birth records suggesting a downward sht across islandsrsquo populations may not always tell the full story.ldquoThe authorities must recognise itrsquos not all one way. There are places like Barra where there has been a real boost in population numbers. Itrsquos worth remembering that not all babies on the islands are born there. Some may be parents ing to the islands with lsquoready-madersquo children that donrsquot appear in the birth statistics.ldquoOthers leave the islands to have their children in hospital in Inverness or Glasgow.ldquoThe pre-school and primary school numbers are what we should be looking at. For example, in North Uist alone therersquos a pre-school mums and tots group that has around  children.ldquoThere have been six sets of twins in the last two years between Benbecula and North Uist.The boost in population was recognised in September in a statement from the Islands Revival, a project supported by the Scottish Government-funded Sefari Responsive Opportunity Initiative and led by the James Hutton Institute and SRUC.Its Islands Revival declaration stated: ldquoWe affirm that there is credible evidence of lsquogreen shootsrsquo of population turnaround in the Scottish islands, which as yet does not show up in official statistics.ldquoThis is illustrated by a number of examples of population growth in islands. It is also indicated by a more positive discourse on population change in island communities.ldquoIt is supported by the changing perceptions of younger, economically active people, especially out-migrant islanders, who increasingly consider their birthplace as a place toto, and at an earlier stage in their lives. Connectivityis playing an important role in popularising this attitude.ldquoIt is important to acknowledge that the demographic aspirations of island communities are not necessarily lsquogrowthrsquo, but rather sustainability, renewal, or restored viability, without risk to social, cultural and environmental assets.The project has also collected its own population statistics which show a % jump in population in West Harris between  and , a doubling in Eiggrsquos numbers since , and growth in Westray in Orkney, Iona and Ulva.Tiny Kerera in the Inner Hebrides, close to Oban, is also said to have doubled in numbers since .Meanwhile, on South Uist, numbers have just been boosted by one ndash although the birth wonrsquot show up on official birth register for the islands.Samantha MacCormick, , recently ed from working in Australia after six years and delivered her lb .oz baby son Darradh in hospital in Glasgow on Thursday.Alongside was her sister Christina Morrison, , who also ed to South Uist after living in Glasgow to raise Finn, three, and one-year-old April with husband Kevin, .ldquoIn Glasgow, we were spending our time working.

HS is one of the biggest players in the Scottish tourism market, with  hostels across Scotland.It accommodates , people a year and has a turnover of pound million, bringing poundm a year the Scottish visitor economy.HS chief executive Margo Paterson admits it was the ldquofunky approach of the designers that led her organisation to Graven, and Hunter says it was his personal memory of, and enthusiasm for, hostelling that convinced him to take on the challenge of upgrading a youth hostel.He now has designs on helping to modernise the rest of the HS estate, talking enthusiastically about designing a special Scottish bunk bed that could be used throughout the HS estate.Both emphasised that the unique nature of hostelling, where travellers get the chance to mix and meet, was key to their thinking.ldquoBecause Edinburgh Central is our flagship hostel and competition is fierce in the capital we wanted to get it right, so we looked to Graven, said Paterson.ldquoTheyrsquore an award-winning Scottish design company ndash what attracted us to them is that they have a great deal of experience in the hospitality world, we are a national hostelling organisation so both ourselves and Graven were really keen to come up with an exciting new design that would really best represent our ongoing modernisation.ldquoTheyrsquore just funky and they have such great ideas.Fascinating archive pictures from Hostelling Scotland and artistsrsquo impressions of the new Edinburgh hostel show how hostelling and hostellers in Scotland have changed over the years.In the s, many hostels were simple wood-clad buildings, such as the well-known Glencoe premises.Riders would use hostels as touring stops, while school groups such Kilmarnock Academy would use them as a holiday base.Warming your knees at the enormous stove was classic entertainment in the s at Crianlarich, and washing facilities at those such as Rowardennan were primitive.Other hostels were in converted big houses, with domestic touches such as fireplaces in the rooms at Oban still evident. But an innovative approach to design has reared its head in the past with the Torridon Hostel built in the s, which still has a touch of mid-century style.The refurbished Glen Nevis hostel has plenty of style, and the new Edinburgh onersquos public areas in the artistsrsquo impressions show the new look of hostels and hostelling.The Edinburgh transformation follows last yearrsquos pound.m upgrade of HSrsquos flagship Glen Nevis hostel, used by thousands each year as a base to climb Ben Nevis and explore the surrounding area.The old wooden building was given a major facelt and an all-new interior, including en-suite bathrooms, twin rooms, giant windows to take advantage of stunning views, and a glossy modern feel. Other hostels are beginning to feel the wind of change, with the barracks-like Inverness hostel getting a smart new lounge and cafe bar area with features such as a water refill station.Hostels modernised recently include Aberdeen, where more private rooms have been installed. There have also been upgrades at Loch Ossian, Achmelvich Beach, Oban and Lochranza on Arran.Ross Hunter, who founded Graven in the s with his partner Janice Kirkpatrick, is delighted to be helping Hostelling Scotland move into a new era.His organisation is better known for designing upmarket interiors at the likes of the Blythswood Square hotel in Glasgow, the VIP lounges at Anfield stadium, and brand and image development at Royal Bank of Scotland premises.Hunter spent many youthful holidays in hostels, starting in  when he paid p a night at the Glen Doll hostel in Angus before walking over Jockrsquos Road to Inverey on Deeside and paying just p to stay there.He said the Edinburgh hostel, a s city-centre office building converted to a hostel in , had become ldquoout of touch with visitorsrsquo expectations: ldquoIt had become a bit institutional looking ndash it might have been a community centre from the s.The challenge was to upgrade it to compete with budget hotels and other cut-price offers for visitors who wanted a more sophisticated city experience, without ruining the communal feel which sets it apart from hotels and Airbnb.He said a cleverly-designed feature dubbed the ldquoGreat Wall of China running along the space managed to unite its dferent uses, while high-end tiles and stone provided the gloss it needed. ldquoIrsquove got fond memories of Scottish hostelling, he said. ldquoA key reason why people stay in hostels is the social experience.ldquoYou meet people who are like-minded ndash whether theyrsquore the same age or not is irrelevant as theyrsquore there because they want the same kind of experience. That opportunity to speak to fellow hostellers is still there and the thing thatrsquos special about hostelling in Scotland is that it provides a really safe environment to have that kind of engagement.The project has fired his imagination. ldquoWe would love the opportunity of extending that kind of thinking into other locations into other hostels too ... we could even design a new Scottish hostel bunk they could use across their estate, he said.HS has been steadily modernising ndash chores for guests were scrapped in the s, alcohol started being sold in , and ldquowardens are now managers ndash but the arrival of Paterson as boss of the organisation accelerated the change, including the new name.Paterson has said HS needs to be in cities, where it has to compete with hotel chains, because that provides surpluses that help pay for upkeep and development of more remote hostels, which the organisation remains deeply committed to.It is also holding true to the ldquoyouth element of the original name, with moves such as the appointment of the first youth trustee, Sophie Bell, . More young trustees are being sought, and a pound, Explorer Fund has been set up to fund trips for youth groups.Paterson added: ldquoWersquoll never be Premier Inn but thatrsquos what our members and guests love about us.The one thing thatrsquos consistent is our welcome and our good customer service but when you go into each hostel therersquos always something a bit dferent."},{"url":null,"title":"pupils-crammed-like-sardines-primary-schools-pushed-limits","story":"Since , hundreds of schools have closed across the country with  fewer schools overall now than there were a decade ago.Dozens of schools, the majority of them primaries, are now having to accommodate more than the maximum number of pupils they were designed for, with some teachers having to use reading rooms, family rooms and Portakabins as routine classroom alternatives.In some cases schools are bulging with up to  per cent more children than they are meant to accommodate, sparking concerns over the impact on their safety and standard of education they receive.Critics have accused the Scottish Government of failing on education and said children are being ldquocrammed in like sardines.Beatrice Wishart, the Liberal Democrats spokeswoman for education, said the data showed that education was not a priority for Nicola Sturgeonrsquos government, and added: \"Its a far cry from fostering an environment thatrsquos conducive to learning.\"While the number of over-capacity secondary schools has reduced in the last  years, from  in  to  in  , the number or primaries schools has risen with  primaries now catering for  per cent or more of the pupils they were designed for, compared with  in .Analysis of the latest education statistics published by the Scottish government show the number of P- children in classes with  or fewer students has also fallen in the last decade.This is despite the Governmentrsquos goal of reducing class sizes for youngsters in the first three years of primary to  pupils or less.In , .% of students in their first three years of education were being taught in classes with up to  pupils, but last year, it was just .% of P- students.In  South Morningside Primary in Edinburgh had one teacher for  P children.Shetland MSP Wishart said: \"Schools across the country are under-resourced and in some cases children are packed in like sardines.ldquoThe number of pupils being taught in super-size classes has soared on the SNPrsquos watch while some buildings simply arenrsquot designed to cope with the numbers of children they are accommodating.ldquoThis is the case in primary schools especially, where some large primary schools are in the region of % over capacity.

People in Orkney will be shocked to hear how often those making emergency calls are being forced to wait due to a lack of land ambulance cover. In many instances, these will be cases where the response time can be critical.“This is absolutely no criticism of Orkney’s ambulance crews, who do outstanding work in operating a service that is clearly over-stretched.

But despite the growing impact of this crisis, there has been little meaningful action from the Scottish Government.“One strand of attracting talented doctors to the region will be ensuring that our medical schools are better linked to our communities. A medical school located within the Highlands and Islands has the potential to attract larger numbers of doctors to study here and then, when they’re qualied, to encourage them to stay and work in our region.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Nobody ever uses the expression when all is well. When a party is united and focused on winning the prize of power, there is no need. But as soon as cracks start to appear out comes this particular explanation. In recent years, there’s been a lot of broad church chatter from Labour Party MPs. We’ve heard it whenever evidence of disharmony in the party’s Westminster group has emerged. And that has happened frequently.To confuse matters, “broad church” is a multipurpose platitude. Those Labour MPs loyal to departing leader Jeremy Corbyn use to it to paper over ision while those who believe the party must move back to the centre ground cite it as an aspiration.“We are a broad church,” insists the Corbynista. “We must become a broad church,” demands the Labour moderate.The truth is that, under Corbyn’s leadership, Labour became a very narrow church indeed. The hard left seized control of the party machine and only those devoted to the cult of Jeremy were considered sound.But the Corbyn era now draws to a close. The current leadership election presents the Labour Party with an opportunity to reposition itself in the political marketplace.In the aftermath of Labour’s humiliating general election defeat in December, it seemed that the contest to replace the new leader would not lead to substantial change in the way the party does its politics. The Corbynista MP, Rebecca Long-Bailey, was widely regarded as an unstoppable candidate who would maintain the positions adopted by the current leader.Now, it seems Long Bailey’s victory is far from assured. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer is the current front-runner in the leadership contest and,he can see this thing through, he will have the opportunity to make real changes in a party currently infected with the disease of ideological purity.In recent years, we have seen far greater public engagement with politics than ever before. Social media has given s to those who would have struggled to have their voices heard and, in some instances, party memberships have soared.This has meant, particularly for the SNP and Labour, healthier finances and huge activist bases on which to depend during campaigns.But the downside for these political parties of greater public engagement with politics has been greater public engagement with politics. Members might be the leblood of political parties but they also, inconveniently, expect to have a say in how things are done.For SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, this has meant juggling the desire of the majority of her members for another independence referendum with the reality that she has neither the power to hold one nor the support to win it.Sturgeon has, so far, survived by perpetually leading the troops to the top of the hill. One last heave and we’re there, she says. The nationalists, however, have not yet reached the summit.Corbyn’s successor will inherit an even larger membership than the SNP’s and these people will have expectations. Given that the majority of these members are enthusiastic supporters of the man who has just led the party to its worst defeat in living memory, the next Labour leader may be tempted to give those members what they want.This would be a mistake on a par with the decision of the members to elect Corbyn leader in the first place.If Starmer can stay ahead of Long-Bailey and wrestle the Labour Party back from the hard left, then his first act as leader must be to make clear that the Corbyn era is firmly over and that those who do not like this are welcome to leave.Political activists are a curious bunch. They assume a great deal about the voting public, not least that they are as engaged with the debate as they are.This delusion leads SNP activists to believe most Scots share their view that the failure of the UK government to grant the First Minister the power to call a second independence referendum represents an abuse of democracy.As we have seen recently, this delusion has led very many Labour supporters to believe that a UK public that rejects Labour wouldto the partyonly it was more left-wing.Starmer – or whoever succeeds Corbyn – must ignore the demands of members who want to maintain the party’s purity.Sturgeon is a master at this. She manages to retain the loyalty of members while clearly and repeatedly failing to give them what they wantThe challenge for the next Labour leader will be greater. Not only will they want to keep membership numbers healthy, they will have to convince the voting public that the party has changed and that there will be no going back to the politics of Corbyn.This will require a fair degree of brutality. The exile of Corbyn favourites such as Richard Burgon and, yes, even Long-Bailey herself, to the back benches would be a good start.It would also helpLabour MPs would stop enthusiastically criticising the Blair and Brown years. On the day in  that Corbyn and Tom Watson were elected leader and deputy leader of the party, Corbyn is said to have told his second in command “We’re got our party back”.The next leader should feel the same way when they watch Corbyn shuffle off to the obscurity from whence he came.I have no doubt that whoever wins the Labour leadership election will have much to say about the party being a broad church. We have room, they will say, for people from many traditions, from the left to the centre.But, in reality, Labour will continue to failthe party doesn’t become narrower, with the hard left cut adrt.Voters have twice looked at Corbyn’s broad church and then decided to congregate where.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"how tories can win back scots who don t like boris brexit or both john mclellan","story":"Tories must learn from last month#s general election victory and the  disaster and focus on developing a winning strategy for next year#s Holyrood elections, rather than detailed policies which can turn into electoral poison, writes John McLellan.In a mood of mischief, I momentarily considered trying to test the Labour Party’s membership system to see whether I could get a vote in the leadership contest, but as Corbynism looks here to stay and it’s impossible to tell who is the worst candidate I quickly concluded there wasn’t any point.In any case, we’re not short of leadership campaigns in the Conservative Party and the process of finding a new Scottish boss is now likely to be a two-horse race between interim leader Jackson Carlaw and his Scottish Parliament colleague Michelle Ballantyne, the former Conservative group leader on Borders Council.Holyrood veteran Mr Carlaw is by some way the favourite, having led the party for the past six months, enjoyed a high TV profile in the General Election and visited the party associations during the campaign. But even before the election was called, Ms Ballantyne was getting around association meetings to raise her profile beyond the Borders in anticipation of a contest sooner or later. Her strong promise to the grassroots of more say to local associations has attracted plenty of support, including some of my Edinburgh Council colleagues, so a good contest is pretty much guaranteed.: The Conservatives have abandoned true conservatism for nationalism – Paris Gourtsoyannis: Alister Jack said he would fund breakaway Scottish Conservative PartyOf course, it’s all very well winning the contest, it’s what happens afterwards that matters and there is a very small window for the winner to settle in and produce a strategy that gives the party a realistic chance of overtaking the SNP as the biggest single party at the  Scottish elections. By the time the result is announced on February , there will be barely  months to go so realistically around seven months to prepare and agree a campaign.That process has been complicated by this week’s departure of strategy and communications chief Eddie Barnes, who planned to go shortly after Ruth Davidson’s decision to step down but agreed to stay on for the election campaign. The gap he leaves is not the only one from Ruth Davidson’s  high-point, with the previous departures of policy chief Marek Zemanic and the closest the Scottish Conservatives had to the left-field thinking power of Dominic Cummings, Kevin Ancell. So the new leader’s top priority is to assemble his or her version of that team, able to work effectively with whatever comes out of Mr Cummings’ Downing Street “weirdos and misfits” shake-up. Scottish party director Lord Mark McInnes and chairman Rab Forman have vital roles to play and both understand the political reality that the minute the contest is over the focus must be on the wider electorate, not party structures. Partly for this reason, it was accepted that turning Ruth Davidson’s succession into an argument about the Scottish party’s relationship with London would be disastrous. The membership is certainly anxious to be talking about new Conservative policies for the  campaign, an attractive, viable alternative programme for government, and for the  campaign not to rely solely on opposition to a second independence referendum.But the key lesson from the  triumph was the simplicity of the message and that campaign had learnt from the  disaster what look like detailed, credible and honest policies on paper can easily become electoral poison.There is more than enough in the SNP’s  years of government to attack without giving Nationalists the means to deflect criticism.We know from the  campaign in Scotland that those Conservatives who turned away did so because they didn’t like Boris Johnson or Brexit or both, but in a dferent context would . The context in  will indeed be dferent Brexit will be done and, like it or not, the election will be about a second independence referendum first and foremost, then the SNP’s record.Cynical though it may seem, details of what the new leader would like to dohe or she is First Minister come after understanding what it will take to win. And sticking to it.Downing Street’s pointless fight with Scottish PressAt a time of unprecedented political change and the perpetual turmoil of the digital communications revolution, the desire of the new UK Government to “slaughter sacred cows” is recognition that so many of the old ways of doing things are no longer suitable. In looking for places to start, Downing Street has chosen what it probably regarded as a soft target by switching the twice-daily official briefings for the Westminster Lobby correspondents from their offices above the Commons to  Downing Street.It’s not dficult to see why this wasn’t thought to be much of a problem because the list of registered Lobby journalists is dominated by heavy representation from the big news organisations  from the BBC alone,  from the , The Sun eight and even the weekly Spectator magazine lists three.Beyond Fleet Street, the Scottish Press is the best-represented group, with staff from this paper, the Herald, Daily Record, The Courier and the Aberdeen Press  Journal, but with only the one from each they will have to dash from the Commons to Downing Street, get through the security gate and into Number  and then the same in reverse to catch whatever business is going on in the House.It’s a needless inconvenience and a reasonable compromise of having the morning brief in Downing Street but the afternoon session kept in the Lobby has been mooted. With the Scottish election looming and a new Scottish leader to bed in, whatever holy cattle are headed for the abattoir, Downing Street shouldn’t pick pointless fights with the Scottish Press.Free trade or holidays Much of Scotland’s global reputation for being lovers of hard drink is based not just on the whisky business but on the bacchanalian revelry which surrounds Hogmanay, to the extent that two bank holidays are needed for the hangover while the rest of the UK gets by with one.But for the newspaper business, January  is a normal publishing day, bringing readers news of the celebrations, the New Year babies, previews of sports fixtures and such like and in the internet age that won’t change.But now it seems First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is set to back a campaign by the shop workers union Usdaw to ban bigger shops from opening on Ne’er Day which would all but wipe out hard copy sales which remain vital to an industry already under severe financial pressures.Labour MSP Jackie Baillie says it’s to allow retail staff to spend more time with their families, but it’s just another excuse for government to interfere with free trade.John McLellan is a Conservative councillor in Edinburgh©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"wanted remote scottish island seeks manager to bring in tourists to forgotten isle","story":"A tiny Scottish island with a population of six people is advertising for a manager to draw in more tourists.The community owned island of Ulva in the Inner Hebrides is looking for a project manager to develop a heritage visitor centre at the former Lairds house, Ulva House.The North West Mull Community Woodland Company Ltd, which owns Ulva, is advertising the job which pays between £, and £,.: The faces of some of Edinburgh’s earliest inhabitants revealedThe job ad states: \"The objectives of the acquisition are to manage the island to provide sustainable benefits with a focus on repopulation and ensuring community ownership delivers benefits for the wider North West Mull area as well as the island itself.\"Since coming into community ownership work has been progressing on several key projects, one of which is the refurbishment and repurposing of the former Lairds House, Ulva House, as a heritage visitor centre with associated self-catering accommodation.\"To this end the company are seeking to appoint an ambitious and experienced project manager.\"More than  people expressed an interest in living on Ulva last year after being bought by islanders who secured up to £. million in funds from the Scottish Land Fund.If all were selected to become islanders it would represent around a , per cent rise in the existing population on the ,-acre island.: Ask the historians: Who was the cruellest figure in Scottish history The job advert adds: \"Ulvas people have inspiring and engaging stories to tell, including that of Lachlan Macquarie - the Founding Father of modern Australia.\"He achieved great success and his influence lives on and is celebrated today.\"However of the thousands of other people who left Ulva, voluntarily or forced, there are other stories of the famous, infamous and not famous - that deserve to be told.\"The focus of the project will be telling the stories of six or so key Ulva iniduals.\"Who they were, set in the context of their times, the impact they had on Ulva and, as they left, the impact they had on the place they went to.\"There are some obvious stories - such as Lachlan Macquarie and one of the Clarks - the Clearance lairds.\"However there will be others, discovered through research, that will tell the story of their time - what it was like to live on Ulva and like to leave Ulva.\"Initial research has already identied a number of interesting characters that need to be explored further.\"The closing date for applications is January  and the job is from March to November .©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"i m no blairite says labour deputy leadership hopeful ian murray","story":"Ian Murray#s Westminster political career has been a series of lonely, thankless battles.Elected in , he held on to his seat for Labour after the retirement of the incumbent, when his party was going backwards and Edinburgh South was the number one Liberal Democrat target.He was one of the earliest movers on the Labour benches pushing the party to back a second referendum on EU membership. And he’s survived two historic SNP landslides that have left him the sole Labour MP in Scotland.Now Murray is taking on the anointed candidate of the left for the deputy leadership, trying to remind the UK Labour Party that Scotland exists.He’s never had to speak about himself much, but he has tohe wants to overcome the legacy of another lonely battle: Murray was among the strongest and earliest critics of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership one of the first to quit the shadow cabinet in .He’s asking for votes from a party dominated by Corbyn supporters who have little sense of him, beyond what they see as disloyalty.“People have preconceived ideas about my politics that aren’t actually true,” Murray says when we sit down in his office, on an upper floor of Portcullis House.There aren’t many artworks on the walls or knick-knacks on the shelves - although he does have a framed political cartoon showing a workman dismantling a Westminster statue of a prime minister, as he shouts: “Don’t move that head yet! Party still can’t find one to replace it.”Murray grew up in the Wester Hailes neighbourhood of Edinburgh, among some of Scotland’s most deprived housing estates.“Mother, father, two kids, grandparents lived a mile on either side, and on the square that we lived in on Dumbryden Gardens, we had two cousins across the road,” he says. “Our best mates that we still go to the football with lived in the top floor of another flat.“We used to all play together in the square. The primary school, Dumbryden Primary School, was just across the bridge behind it.”His father and uncle worked in what is now the Whyte  Mackay whisky distillery, starting out as coopers. Murray’s mum was mainly at home looking after him and his brother, doing the odd bit of part time work, like cleaning at a Woolworths. But then his father died at the age of , when Murray was nine and his brother .“She did a kitchen job in a pub. She worked in a pub called the Busy Bee in Saughton which was next to her parents. It was a pretty rough pub, but nobody got on the wrong side of her.”Later, he went to the Wester Hailes Education Centre, which still has one of the lowest attainment rates in Scotland. Murray says he “loved it” and would have been a teacherhe hadn’t gone into politics, but he went to university at just  “because school didn’t have much left for me to do”.Like much of the time, there’s a wink in Murray’s voice as he adds: “I didn’t drink, honest.”Murray was part of the University of Edinburgh’s Lothian Equal Access Programme for Schools, which works to get pupils from the most deprived areas around the Scottish capital into one of the UK’s most prestigious ancient universities.“That’s why I’m quite passionate about university entry stuff,” he says. Murray was part of a summer programme that brings teenagers on to the university campus to show them what le as a student is like, and he won an offer from Edinburgh conditional on getting five marks at higher level, two of which had to be As.“I was OK in four subjects that I did, but I was doing music at a higher level for the first time, and I hadn’t done music at standard grade level. And I was doing drums and piano. The music teacher saidyou want to get into Edinburgh University at the end of fth year, you’re going to have to do something other than play the drums, because you’re hopeless.“I said, what other instrument can I do  She went, you can’t learn another instrument to that kind of level between now and then. You’re going to have to sing.“So I sang my way into uni really.”Murray concludes: “People go, ‘well, you know, you’re just a right-wing Blairite.’ And you go, well actually no, that upbringing was… the word tough is the wrong word to use, but it was as working class as any other person who’s on that deputy leadership slate.”Football, pubs and politics have dominated Murray’s le. There was a bookmakers next to the Busy Bee, and his mother was also an independent bookie, taking her chalkboard to Musselburgh Racecourse. “You tell her the odds of something and she’ll work it out for you.” Murray was instrumental in the fan bailout of his beloved Heart of Midlothian FC, as chairman of the supporters’ trust.Before being elected to parliament, Murray had a business running pubs and bars. His uncle, who became a “pseudo father”, would take him on the long walk across Edinburgh to Musselburgh. Murray remembers the route he took as a ten and  year-old the name of the pubs along the way. “He’d go in and I would stand outside.”Rather than Tony Blair or Gordon Brown, who Murray describes as a “titan of politics”, his personal hero is John Smith.“We were brought up in my family to boo at the TV every time Thatcher came on,” Murray says. “And Ken Clarke because he was the Chancellor, and Malcolm Rkind, who was the local MP. When I told my mum at her th birthday party that I had lunch with Ken Clarke to talk about how we stop Brexit, she was furious.”Murray rejects the suggestion that he is the “centrist candidate” against Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary and a loyal Corbyn lieutenant throughout. He says he would serve as shadow Scottish Secretary – a position he has been locked out of under Corbyn – for any of the leadership candidates.Murray defends much of the  manesto, particularly on rail renationalisation and the call for a Green Industrial Revolution, but says it went “too far” in some places. A promise of free broadband internet was greeted on the doorsteps as “interesting but barking mad”, says Murray, and argues that the industry and public would have welcomed a voucher system that achieved the same aim without committing Labour to another big renationalisation.“I thinkyou look at Angela Rayner’s politics and mine, there’s probably a cigarette paper between us on most of the value-driven stuff,” he says.“I think the dference is – and I don’t think it’s unkind to say this – I was outside the tent, trying to reflect what people were saying to me, and she was inside the tent trying to reflect what was inside the tent to the public.“I always said to people in the Shadow Cabinet and to Jeremy himself that he had to change course, because that’s what the public were telling us. Andhe didn’t, the public would have their say. And the public had their say on  December.”Murray adds: “You’ve got two things you can do in politics. You can either listen to the public… or you can stick to your political purity and lose the public. And I’d rather be in government than in opposition.”Having built a coalition in his own seat that has kept the SNP at bay, Murray’s pitch to the party is that he knows how to craft a message that is patriotic while also being pro-Union, pro-Europe and true to left-wing values, and can see off a tide of post-Brexit nationalism.But he looks at risk of losing the argument at home, where the Scottish Labour party is ready to open the door to a second independence referendum – and perhaps in the UK party, too.Clive Lewis, an outsider to make it on to the Labour leadership ballot, told the National newspaper this week that Scottish Labour should back indyref and its members free to campaign for independence, and even Sir Keir Starmer, who Murray is advising on Scottish issues along with Jess Phillips, appears open to allowing a referendumthere is a pro-independence majority after the  Holyrood elections.“I wouldn’t say that UK political parties have forgotten Scotland. I’d say that UK political parties to a certain extent don’t fully understand it,” Murray says.“I wouldn’t go to a national newspaper in the southeast of England and say ‘I’m sorry, but I disagree that Norwich’s High Street should be pedestrianised.’ I mean, why would I  I know nothing about it. I’d be sticking my nose into something that I don’t really need to stick my nose into, and I’d be talking shit.”Murray says embracing indyref is a mistake for Labour, which “cannot be pandering to stuff that we don’t believe in for the sake of getting more votes”.“Let the SNP put on the front page of a manesto, ‘give us a mandate for a second independence referendum’ at the  Scottish elections and let’s see what the electorate say,” he argues.“I will be saying, ‘Look, by the time that  comes along, we’ll have had  years of SNP government in Scotland. Everything has got worse, by every single measure: child poverty, NHS, education, transport, justice, economy, employment, hope and aspiration for the future, house building…’“They’ve spent the last  years managing decline and what they’re asking you to do is to give them an independent country so they can trash that as well.

Though not the primary escape route, they are still an escape route in an emergency.“It’s a bit alarming to know that should there be an emergency, escape would’ve been delayed because of locked exits, and, depending on the emergency, could pose a real risk.”The Rail, Maritime and Transport union , which represents most Sleeper staff, said it had been informed.A spokesperson said: “RMT is fully aware of the problem and its serious nature. We are consulting with our reps on the Sleeper over both a solution and any further action required to ensure safe operation.”The Office of Rail and Road, which regulates safety, said: “Normally in an emergency situation, the safest place is inside the train, as the vehicle is designed to protect the passengers.“Should evacuation be necessary, the primary route is via the doors.“In an extreme situation, such as the vehicle being on its side, windows can be used.“Normally, windows are secured but not locked, and have sensors to noty the train managerthey are open.“On rare occasions, a  signal may be sent and the train manager is required to assesses the situation and may need to lock the window.“Windows are secured to prevent an open window fouling the path of trains on adjacent lines.”Ryan Flaherty, Serco’s managing director for Caledonian Sleeper said: “Clear processes and standards exists to assess and manage any risks so the safety of our guests and staff is not compromised.“The emergency windows have been designed, approved and risk assessed andthere is a fault with a window they can be locked until the problem is resolved.“As you would expect, guest and staff safety is always our number one priority and the new Caledonian Sleeper fleet is fully compliant with all mandated safety standards.

Two other swimmers making their yearly pilgrimage were Arthur Chatfield from Scotland and Alan Traynor from Donegal.Several families also participated and among them were, the Eddie and Scott Gilmore, Simon and Chole Murphy, Darren and Curtis Donnell, Alister and Laurie Neeson, Anthony and Paul O’Rawe, Brian Lemon and Son Brian, Robert, Matthew, Sarah and Joy Bowman, Andrew and William Knox and David and Naomi Morrow. With the favourable weather it was a great day for the number of new first-time swimmers and in particular the young people taking part along with the usual stalwarts.With everyone back on terra firma and changed they made their way to the Bridge Inn to get fed and watered prior to the social festivities taking place. Chairman, Billy McIlroy, said it was “very pleasing” to see so many swimmers including young people on the events th year.Mementoes and certicates were presented by Mrs Sharon Smyth and Mrs Ann Ryan to the swimmers who had taken part on the day with all the swimmers being warmly applauded.After the presentations the Chairman again paid tribute to those who sponsored the swimmers this year as they have done for many years in the past. Last year the swim raised the magnicent sum of pound and this year again has got off to a brilliant start with pound being lted on the day thanks to the generous sponsorship from the general public. The social festivities got off to a good start with Bert Kernohan carrying out the duties of compere and the music being supplied by Two Star Country. The Choir Challenge followed with the ladies out to regain their crown which they had lost last year. They went first conducted by Dana Kernohan setting a very high standard for the judge Billy McIlroy. The men followed and put on a wonderful performance under the leadership of Bert Kernohan.In judging Billy said he had to apply the “Var” as used in football and on this the better harmonising by the ladies gave them the win by the slimmest of margins which was received with rapturous applause.Next year will be the th anniversary of the event which will be a Major Milestone in its history.The Chairman thanked everyone who in any way assisted in helping to make the event the success that it was.The swim took place under the watchful eye of Larne Branch St Johns Ambulance, East Antrim R.N.L.I., Kayakers Jim Mulvenna, Marion O’Dornan and her sister Claire Corr.

The -year-old contract, which secured the services of Downpatrick footballer Jimmy Connor, is now the oldest artefact in the society’s museum.Signed on July , the document was for a season-long spell from September  of that year until April  in . However, Connor was also part of Belfast Celtic’s first league winning side of the - season.His highly decorated career would see him win virtually every trophy in Irish football, including a further league title with Glentoran and the inaugural Gold Cup in .The Belfast Celtic Society received the artefact from an anonymous donor, who found it in a pub in County Down.Speaking about the find, the society’s Chairman, Pádraig Coyle, said: “It means a huge amount to us.“The donor, when they did a bit of research and saw who this man was, they got in touch with the Society and askedwe would be interested in having them in the museum and of course we were delighted and very pleased that they are there. “It’s just another bit in the jigsaw of the story that is Belfast Celtic.”Signed by Belfast Celtic Secretary Robert Barr, the deal saw Connor receive a £ signing-on fee and  shillings per week. Mr Coyle said the fairly lucrative contract offers an insight into how well the club treated its players.“He was paid a fair wage then, and it’s interesting when you look at the document and see that when they were injured they still got paid provided they showed a doctor’s certicate,” he said,“It’s another reflection of how Belfast Celtic tried to look after its players in those days. Bear in mind that there wasn’t social security back then, there weren’t employers insurance arrangements, so it would’ve meant a lot to the guy thathe was hurt that his employers would look after him. I’m not surethat was common practice, but that’s how he was treated by Belfast Celtic.”Connor was seen as a particularly tough player, who would walk from Downpatrick to Belfast for training sessions, but for all his physical prowess and skill he was, given the time, relatively uneducated and simply signed his contract with an ‘X’.“It’s absolutely no reflection on him that maybe he wasn’t able to read or write, but how many people back then would’ve had access to education in the way that we do so now,” Mr Coyle explained.“What became the  Plus Act, the Education Act, wasn’t introduced until , so for many people having a basic education just wasn’t as easy,you lived in a rural area it was much more dficult.“I hadn’t seen a contract signed with an ‘X’ before I saw his contract. Of course, this was  years ago.”While the contract offers a fascinating insight into Belfast Celtic as a club, Mr Coyle said it contributes to the wider history of the city, particularly around St James’ and the Park Centre site where Celtic Park once sat.“It all helps to tell the story of that part of the city because at the time Jimmy Connor was playing for them they were the star attraction in that part of the area. People’s lives revolved around seeing Belfast Celtic midweek and on a Saturday. “The man who would’ve signed Jimmy Connor, his name is at the top of the contract, Robert Barr – he was a school teacher and he gave that up to become full-time secretary of Belfast Celtic Football Club. He worked for them until his death. There is a story there too. You’ll know St James’ and there’s a roadthat leads to Willowbank’s playing pitch and my surmising of it is that he lived in a house back in the day when there wouldn’t have been that road there, but he lived in a house, from what I’ve been told, that led into the Belfast Celtic ground.

We remain unconvinced that the cultural traditions and identity of the Orange family will be meaningfully promoted or safeguarded by these proposal.#Earlier Conradh na Gaeilge had branded the proposals an #historic advancement# for the Irish language but ones which fell #far short# of previous government commitments by the Irish and British governments.The deal includes a number of provisions for the language including the appointment of a Irish Language Commissioner.Dr Niall Comer, President of Conradh na Gaeilge, said that deal was #undoubtedly historic#, however, the organisation highlighted the absence of an Irish Language Act as promised in the  St Andrew#s Agreement. #This legislation is undoubtedly an historic advancement for our community, and for those who wish to use the language, by providing historic official status, legal protection and an Irish language Commissioner for the first time in the history of the state,# Dr Comer said.#This has only come about as the result of a tireless, inspirational and bottom up campaign which has transformed how people here now view the language and ultimately how the state will interact with our community and shared language moving forward.#Ciarán Mac Giolla Bhéin of Conradh na Gaeilge added: #This protection comes in the form of an Irish language Bill being pasted into the GFA, independent from the other language legislation, as new, separate parts of that agreement. If passed, we will hold any new power-sharing executive fully to account on the full implementation of these proposals and will tirelessly test and expose the weaknesses and glaring omissions in the coming days, weeks and months. #There are some huge question marks here. These proposals fall far short of the commitments made in the  St Andrew’s Agreement, which promised an Irish language Act based on the Welsh legislation and does not contain provisions that are made for language in Wales or in the south, as was explicitly committed to by both Governments. #The complete omission of visibility and signage is hugely frustrating and will undoubtedly be a source of tension and will expose major fault-lines on contested cases of signage in the coming period. However, the possibility of the delivery of signage through language standards will be rigorously and immediately tested by our community. #The role and remit of the commissioner being left to the sign-off of OFMDFM leaves us at the whim of a veto being used against core components of the legislation and drafting and delivery of services. The use of any veto to limit, obstruct or frustrate delivery of services and rights would undoubtedly erode trust and could be potentially catastrophic for any incoming Executive.#We welcome the adoption of recommendations included in our consultation document for the centuries long overdue repeal of the final remaining  Penal Law, that will now facilitate the use of Irish in Courts the new central translations hub the right to use Irish in the Assembly, where it was previously sneered at and belittled, which includes a provision for simultaneous translation. Finally, the commitment to an Irish language Strategy has the potential to transform our community in the coming years. #We will now work diligently towards testing the glaring gaps in the legislation that prevent us from playing a fair and equal role in our society. Legal advice is being sought on several of the provisions, including the ‘official status’ provision. The devil is not only in the detail of the legislation, but in the implementation of that legislation.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"o theanga leipreachain go dti acht ghaeilge","story":"I , caitheadh amach as mo chéad chruinniú den Chomhairle i mBéal Feirste mé as Gaeilge a labhairt.Nó “teanga leipreacháin” mar bhaist Sammy Wilson uirthi.Mhuscail mé inniu agus Acht Ghaeilge ar an táirseach againn.Moill ró-fhada ach d’éirigh linn mar phobal Gaeilge ó Thuaidh tabhairt ar na húdaráis an tAcht a bhí geallta ó  a ghéillstin.Tá na heilimintí tábhachtacha atá de dhíth in aon Acht ansin:Stádas oigiúil.Coimisinéir Teanga.Caighdeáin seachas scéimeanna.Agus ar ndóighe tá ríméad ar leith orm go bhfuil aistriúchán comhuaineach le bheith curtha ar fáil sa Tionól féin agus comhaltaí ag caint Gaeilge.

Irish language, Ulster-Scots, ministerial standards, military veterans..pushMaybe we need an Independent Commission for Commissioning like the old Decommissioning one. Whatever ones view of the New Decade. New ApproachStormont deal, it involves plenty of job creation.Assuming they remain in post, Arlene Foster and Michelle ONeill will certainly own what is agreed.They will be the Supreme Commissioners responsible for the appointments of the language commissioners.Those appointees will work closely with the Orwellian-sounding Office of Identity and Cultural Expression to promote \"cultural pluralism\"- a grievance factory in waiting.Whats in it for the unlucky few not to get a commissioner job  There is much of merit but also some woolliness. The Executive will examine, enhance, explore, publish strategiesetc. etc. The document is better where its specic pledges are found. There is something old, something new, something borrowed and something red-white-and-blue in the plan.Old  The language proposals are , reheated. A three-stranded arrangement covering Irish language, Ulster-Scots and general identity issues. For Sinn Fein, the Irish Language Actmight not be standalone but the amended Northern Ireland Act gives most of what a dedicated bill would have offered. An ILA was never going to include formal quotas for Irish speakers, nor compulsory Irish in schools or on street signs.The question begged is what will the Irish Language Commissioner promote - and how -so little is statutory and when faced with likely opposition from unionist parties  The postholder is obliged to \"enhance the development of the use of the Irish language by public authorities\". In what ways  And what happensthey do not cooperate Petitions of concernwill be \"ed to their intended purpose\" - which was never actually defined in their two brief mentions in the Good Friday Agreement. The plan says they will now require support from at least two parties states the plan. But given  is the highest number of MLAs held by a single partyno party can go solo anyway. So its hardly a major change. That said, there is some laudable text introducing greater precision over how PoCs are deployed and at which stages of the legislative process.Meanwhile, the  Stormont House Agreement dealing with legacy and other issues is to be delivered \"within  days\" - a mere six years late.New  There is some serious money involved in the package. The economic aspects are the most positive.Substantial cash is attached, more even than that netted by the DUP in its  confidence-and-supply deal. This money will offer positive benefits to many peoples lives, via improved mental health provision, a pay settlement for nurses - and  more of them and three courses of IVF treatment. The infrastructure financial promises to Derry, especially, are potentially transformative.On Brexit, there will be a dedicated committee and a promise that a restored Northern Ireland Executive will be consulted - but anyone thinking that this say will be crucial should ask the devolved administrations how they regard the effectiveness of the Joint Ministerial Council, particularly on EU matters. The replies will be less than complimentary.The deal promises legislation to ensure the seamlessness of NI-GB trade but its the GB-NI direction that is more problematic given what the EU deal states.Neither the UK nor a restored devolved government can wish away Protocol text which requires goods heading from GB to NI to be treated as potential entrants to the EU Single Market - requiring checks and declaration which do impair the UK single market.Borrowed  There are long-overdue rules on ministerial accountability and a laudable bolstering of an official Opposition, finally imported from most western democracies. For any party, there is the option of entering an official opposition with much greater recognition than the embryo which emerged in the dying years of the previous Assembly. Useful ideas on civic engagement, increasingly evident in other political systems, have also been incorporated.Red, white and blue  The Union flag can be hoisted on public buildings for an extra few days. But presumably not for the Sussexes.On a bad day for Stormont cobwebs, the British and Irish governments must be pleased with their work.Dealing with Northern Ireland must seem a breeze for the Dublin administration, compared to organising RIC commemorations.The DUP was first out of the blocks to hail the plan as the basis for a deal. That basis is far more the changed political context than the deals novelty. A Stormontseemed certain the moment the exit poll appeared on our TV screens on December . What was unsellable internally within the DUP on language amid Westminster glories in  is now a case of needs-must. Without Stormont, the DUP - and everyone  - faces a generation of powerlessness. Its a bleak vista none of the parties wished to contemplate.So, will it be fun to stay with the NDNA  In the short-term yes but the deal needs to endure for years for Stormont to restore its credibility. Maybe a role for a Prevention of Breakdown Commissioner Jon Tonge is Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There are pressures all around us stretching our capacity for goodwill, people and events demanding we seek the perfect in an imperfect world. But, it is the pragmatists who continue to survive while the competition withers away.The New Decade, New Approach released by the British and Irish governments on Thursday evening should be and has been welcomed by the business community. We understand the need for the compromises it contains. Ultimately we understand the urgent need to get this devolution show back on the road.From an NI economy point of view there are of course many gaps in the document which we could choose to concentrate on, but there are also really signicant commitments and promises of investment. We cant, wont and shouldnt get all that we want.However, it is clear that the contribution of the business community in the past  months in particular has been registered by the two Governments and hopefully our local parties.As evidence, after PM Boris Johnson did a rollover and agreed a Withdrawal Agreement with the EU in October, the business community came together and presented a large body of ideas, interventions and investments to protect, repurpose and regenerate the NI economy post-Brexit. Much of these are committed to in the New Decade, New Approach proposals.Again, this past week we worked and got agreement from all our local MPs on amendments to the Withdrawal Agreement Bill. Not surprisingly, given the Tory majority in Parliament, these amendments were rejected as the Government wish to have a clean passage of the Bill to get Brexit done.However, again, the requirements of these Amendments are in the deal presented to local parties on Thursday evening. The crisis in our health system, the stresses in education are well understood by the public. For those two areas alone, it is worth the local parties allowing pragmatism to overrule their desire for the perfect deal.A collective NI Executive voice was sadly absent from the Brexit debate this past couple of years. With Boris deal now done,  is a critical year where how we trade with Great Britain for the next generation will be defined. We really need our local politicians back and batting for us.And it will take civic society to play our part in creating and protecting the space which allows any new Executive to get going quickly. As we did with the Brexit debate, we are prepared to offer our insight, expertise and effort to help.\"New Decade, New Approach\" is not perfect, but there is much to be admired. There is much to get us going, again. For us, there is enough. Lets get it done.Stephen Kelly is chief executive, Manufacturing NI"},{"url":null,"title":"storm brendan set to batter the island of ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Ministers were appointed and the rusty wheels of democracy were turning once again.Outside in the Great Hall, little clusters of departmental officials and press officers hovered ready to pounce on their new ministers.After most had been swept off for their first day briefings, one solitary official remained, looking somewhat concerned.“Mine has probably slipped out the back door,” she said, only half joking.So today I was shown a Stormont room opened for the first time since collapse.

I am to be shot with  others in about an hour.” googletag.cmd.push Robert Boyd was  when he died, having participated in General Torrijos’ ill-fated expedition to overthrow King Ferdinand VII of Spain in . Through betrayal by a presumed ally, General Moreno, the expedition failed, and the participants were captured. After a period of incarceration in Malaga, they were, without any semblance of justice, taken out and executed by firing squad.According to historians, In , Spain wrestled with political unrest. Ferdinand VII had been restored to the throne by the British in , on condition that he ruled under the more liberal Constitution of . Unfortunately, Ferdinand reneged on this, preferring an autocratic approach to sovereignty.In , Ferdinand’s misrule provoked a revolt in favour of the  Constitution. googletag.cmd.push Ferdinand was captured but then made promises for reform. However, after his release in , he again reneged on these undertakings and avenged himself against his ‘liberal’ opponents with great ferocity. This repression of those considered to be holding ‘liberal views’ drove many into exile amongst these was Jose Maria de Torrijos and Uriarte . Torrijos sought refuge in England during the s. During his time in England, he attracted a following of like-minded people seeking to defend the cause of liberty and fight against the absolutist and repressive regime of Ferdinand VII. Amongst those followers was Boyd, then a lieutenant in the East India Company’s army.

Its strategic plan centres around funding for the Greater Belfast Development with no mention of its Magee or Coleraine campuses which have witnessed student numbers drop signicantly in the past five years. The University’s most recent Financial Statement for  , outlines its long-term financial strategy. UU’s five-year strategic plan ‘Five and Fty’ sets the vision and mission of the University. It states: “As Northern Ireland’s civic university, Ulster University will deliver outstanding research and teaching that encourages the innovation, leadership and vision needed to help our community thrive.” googletag.cmd.push It details ambitions to deliver an “operating surplus” to support a sustainable investment strategy in both the University’s physical resources and information technology facilities. This includes the generation of “sufficient cash reserves” to allow for the allocation of poundm per annum to capital projects of which poundm per annum is towards the Greater Belfast Development and the repayment of loans to fund this project. A spokesperson for the Derry University Group has urged UU to immediately hand over its lands to city-region, saying: UU is demonstrating all the hallmarks of a struggling multi-national business running down a neglected outpost. Ulster needs to hand over the lands and budgets at Magee to the city-region immediately to allow us to develop university provision here autonomously. Ultimately, we can sit and watch UU die slowly in the regions while it moves to Belfast, or we can take proper control of the situation ourselves and start building for the future, with a vengeance. googletag.cmd.push The idea of Council partnering in a multi-million pounds development City Deal with organisation such as UU is frankly ludicrous. Imagine you were about to invest poundm and performed due diligence on your partners and found out they had UUs record. You would leave the table immediately. Council must do likewise. Signicant problems The University’s approved financial strategy aimed to ensure the financial viability of UU. Any borrowings were not to exceed that approved in the Business Plan for the Greater Belfast Development and any other projects that may arise which are confirmed as self-funding. The strategy also aimed to support the development of activities that generate income for growth. However, since the   financial statement was published the Northern Ireland Audit Office released a report showing that the Greater Belfast Development has encountered signicant problems, and delays, meaning it now needs to attract substantial additional external finance to bridge a major funding gap. It is anticipated to run poundm over budget. The business case, approved in March , envisaged that the expanded Belfast Campus would be open to students in September  at a cost of pound million. Funding was to come mainly from the UU’s own reserves and external borrowing, with the Department for the Economycontributing poundm capital grant. UU has earmarked cash reserves of poundm built up since , to support the project and committed a further pound million over the next three years. This is over and above the pound.m spent by UU to date. The total cost of the project is now estimated at pound.m including  per cent VAT which is irrecoverable.

Speaking about the event, Roy said: “The poetry of Seamus Heaney has always captured my attention. Often Heaney manages to say with a touching sensitivity and brilliant eloquence the kinds of things I am also trying to say through my own song writing. His is truly poetry for the soul. To be invited to play at the Heaney HomePlace for this, the third January running is a special honour and a thrill.”During the afternoon gig, which will take place between .pm and .pm, Anne and Roy will feature tracks from their “Songs for the Soul” CD .All tracks were composed by Roy, as well as songs from artists as ious as Judy Collins, Tom Waits and the late and much mourned, Eamon Friel.Anne explained: “Both of us are delighted to be joined by that fabulous musician and arranger, ‘the maestro’ Eddie O Donnell on keys and guitar as well as by my brother, Michael Corey, a mighty singer with a wide repertoire of songs.“Another Moneymore woman, Maura Johnston, whose poems from The Whetsone were launched to great celebration at the Heaney HomePlace during March , will add a special colour and richness to the afternoon.” The final member of this very talented troupe is Buncana-based Tom Byrne, wizard on both accordion or harmonica. He will be making his debut at the Heaney HomePlace.“The six of us are all looking forward to performing together at the Home Place,” said Anne. She added: “We have chosen a set-list which includes both original and traditional songs, songs we hope will touch the hearts of the audience gathered together in Bellaghy just a couple of weeks into the new year, songs with a story to them, songs that explore the pull of ‘home,’ ‘identity’ and ‘place’ and songs with a bit of craic to them.“Though I have lived in Derry city for quite a number of years, for me it is special to be performing in such a magnicent venue so close to my own home town of Moneymore. “And I am thrilled that my brother, Brendan Corey, is making a pilgrimage to the Heaney HomePlace all the way from Long Island, New York.“Brendan has been singing and playing professionally in New York for over  years but has joined us for a few songs over the past three years. “He is truly smitten by the atmosphere and audience reception in the Heaney Home Place.”Anne Tracey, Roy Arbuckle, Eddie ODonnell, Michael Corey, Maura Johnston, Tom Byrne, and Brendan Corey appearing at the Heaney Home Place, Bellaghy, from .pm this Saturday,  January.

This information can now be easily recorded through the elicence website.John McCartney, director of conservation and protection, said: “This is really important information because it enables our scientists to understand how many fish are caught, taken or ed back to the river and how much time anglers put into catching those fish.“ It provides an indication of how well stocks are doing andwe need to take any action should catches take a turn for the worst.”Freshwater fishery biologist, Mark McCauley, said the Loughs Agency used anglers logs s to manage the fisheries of Foyle. He added: “We use the data to screen proposed developments such as roads, hydro, etc that may impact the interests of the fishery.“We can also use the data anglers provide to assess the strength of fish runs in the system this year and also for long term trend monitoring.”Have you purchased a Loughs Agency licence this year  Log in with your angler number at https:elicence.loughs-agency.org and update your angling log for the  season. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Walking into work one day she collapsed. She had become incapable of processing the traumas that people living in some of most deprived areas of Europe were enduring on a daily basis.She found herself coming back to her original training as an artist and started a journey towards her own healing by going to church.Bronagh says she asked herself a lot of questions as she attended Protestant and Catholic services in Belfast and beyond.She says: ldquoWhatinstead of listening to the continuous repeated stories of Protestant vs Catholic in Belfast, an inidual had first-hand experience of visiting every church in the city for a service, simply looking and listening when going to each one ldquoWhat would they see and hear  As a non-church goer starting out on this journey, how would you feel ten years later  What is going on in churches in contemporary Belfast  How might this open-minded curiosity inform the continuous shting conversation about the city that I call home Belfast: City of Light costs pound and is available online at lulu.

I am guided by the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie also recalled the words of the very early th century Irish political thinker, AE Russell, who said: ldquoThe strength of Irish culture lies, I believe, in plurality rather than unormity.The view that national culture is a guarantor of homogeneous identity is no longer tenable. A living culture follows a multiplicity of voices. Authentic culture is not a matter of ourselves alone. Baroness Ritchie said that running alongside the Good Friday Agreement, Russellrsquos words are the embodiment of her political philosophy mdash partnership, working together, respect for political and ethnic dference and unity in ersity.She then focused on the Queenrsquos speech, issuing a reminder that it dealt with a plethora of issues, with Brexit, the environment, National Health Service, climate change and devolved Institutions chief among them.ldquoOf these, Brexit has been one of the greatest political catalysts in Britain and Ireland, said Baroness Ritchie.ldquoIt has consumed all aspects of our lives in Northern Ireland since the referendum of June  where the people voted to remain in the EU. It has impacted on identity, sovereignty and nationality.ldquoLike the majority in Northern Ireland I want to remain in the EU and realise that due to the Governmentrsquos majority in this parliament we will leave the one institution that has provided so much political, social and economic stability on the island of lreland.Baroness Ritchie argued that EU membership had diluted territorial and mind borders and contributed much to reconciliation and developing the economy and infrastructure, urging the British government to look at how this can be achieved in any new working arrangements.ldquoBrexit has undermined the principles of the Good Friday Agreement in relation to reconciliation and building a shared society, the maiden speech continued.ldquoIt has deepened political isions at a time when our political institutions were collapsed. Being a concept that is essentially about the economy it has become a major constitutional issue in Northern Ireland.ldquoMoreover, the EU Withdrawal Bill, which will give effect to Brexit, will have direct consequences for trade between Britain and Ireland and between Northern Ireland and Britain. It will also reduce parliamentary accountability and lessen protections for workersrsquo rights.Baroness Ritchie said people do not want borders either in Ireland or in the Irish Sea. She insisted they want to build reconciliation, intra community political progress, economic and social regeneration and social justice,the very factors she explained that were enhanced by EU membership and which could be damaged when the UK leaves.She continued: ldquoWe need the closest possible links with the EU. We need favourable trading terms with the EU and as a cautionary warning to the government, there canrsquot be zero trade details with the EU and then do our own thing. Borders and bureaucracy need to be lessened and a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU is required.ldquoThere is a need for access to the biggest market in Britain which takes half of our agricultural food sales from Northern Ireland which is equivalent of pound.bn. Coming from an area where there are two fishing ports, the fishing industry is looking for the current unhindered and unfettered access to itrsquos main market in Britain to continue. I support that concept too.On the wider political issue, Baroness Ritchie said devolved institutions need to be up and running in Northern Ireland, expressing hope that the current Stormont talks process will bear fruit for the local population.ldquoThat is what the population is yearning for and what I hope can be achieved to help achieve a healing process and a period of moderation.Turning to the weeks and months ahead, Baroness Ritchie said she hopes that during her time in the House of Lords mdash along with other Lords and Baronesses mdash she wants to work towards building reconciliation, fairness, equality and a shared society in Northern Ireland, explaining that this requires a plan to ldquoend ision and bring down the physical and mental walls of ision.She declared: ldquoI would hope that we can work across this House to achieve that process of moderation and peaceful politics in Northern Ireland a comprehensive trade deal with the EU to assist our economy and a plan to end austerity and poverty and ensure proper financial mitigations are in place to deal with the punitive rigours of welfare reform.ldquoClimate change needs to be tackled, just look at the floods in Britain and the intensity of the heat in Australia which has resulted in the bush fires, and whilst reference is made to tackling it in the Queenrsquos Speech, this issue needs international efforts. I believe continued membership of the EU is required to address and offset manrsquos inhumanity to our precious planet.Baroness Ritchie concluded her speech by highlighting how much she is looking forward to working with colleagues across the House on a range of policy issues over the coming months and years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Meeting.jpg","title":"Meeting called to address Saintfield sewage issues  ","story":"THE current ban on new development in Saintfield will be discussed at the end of the month when local politicians meet with senior officials from NI Water.The temporary ban was imposed by the organisation in July  after it confirmed that it was not permitting new connections to the townrsquos sewer system.With Saintfieldrsquos sewage treatment plant approaching the end of its capacity, NI Water is in the process of completing a comprehensive drainage area planning model for the town, with the exercise also focusing on the treatment plant which continues to comply with all stringent environmental discharge standards.The detailed study was ordered in the wake of a number of sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road in the town during periods of heavy rain.NI Water engineers have installed special valves along sections of the sewer network at this part of the town in a bid to prevent future spills but have confirmed that no additional work is planned until the drainage area study has been completed. This means that the temporary ban is set to remain in place.At Monday nightrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, politicians discussed the detail of a letter from NI Water which detailed that the organisation has identied a requirement in the region of around pound.bn to maintain safe, clean drinking water and address main issues with sewer networks between  and .The news comes after NI Water revealed recently that during this period, an additional poundm investment will be required across the council area.While politicians are concerned about the poor waste water infrastructure in ious parts of the district, the need for investment in Saintfield is viewed as a key priority by many concerned atthe current moratorium on new-build schemes.The lack of investment in the districtrsquos sewerage infrastructure is being blamed on years of underinvestment in the system and the failure to upgrade networks of pipes installed decades ago which are struggling to cope with demand.Rowallane councillors Terry Andrews and Billy Walker say the situation in Saintfield needs to be addressed as a matter or urgency.Cllr Andrews described the detail of the NI Water letter as ldquoparticularly worrying and said the scale of the investment is unlikely to be made available by the government.ldquoThe current housing ban and the need to upgrade Saintfieldrsquos sewerage network is impacting on a signicant number of people and has ramications for the construction industry and buildersrsquo suppliers, he added.Cllr Walker said there were ldquoserious issues in Saintfield with the moratorium on new-build having an impact. He said the sewerage network needs an upgrade and this must be carried out as soon as possible.ldquoIn the past, raw sewage has been back flowing into peoplersquos toilets and spewing out from underneath manhole covers into gardens. Such a situation is intolerable. The current system cannot cope.Cllr Walker said the problem was not with the townrsquos sewage treatment plant but the pipes which supply it, explaining that suggested level of investment required to tackle the problem is in the region of poundm.He added: ldquoPeoplersquos lives in Saintfield are being made a misery. In the first instance, the poundm needed for the town must be found. If we donrsquot get satisfaction from NI Water at the end of the month and the Assembly is not sitting, we need to go directly to a direct rule minister.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke said NI Water was making it clear that it did not have the budget to carry out the required work and blamed austerity measures on cuts to public services.ldquoI hope the Assembly will be up and running and we have a local minister in place and that there will be the required cash injection. The ban on new development does have an impact, particularly on the construction industry. The reduction on the block grant also isnrsquot helping.Independent councillor Jarlath Tinnelly said no big decisions were ever taken locally, but ldquokicked down the road forever and a day because political parties are afraid to make them.He added: ldquoThere is a day of reckoning coming for all public services and I remember reading years ago that the introduction of water charges would sort out the infrastructure problem.ldquoI am certainly not advocating that course, but the point is that these big decisions are pushed further along for someone  to deal with.

Lidl says it has been looking for an alternative town centre site for over decade without success until the Shanslieve Drive site became available, with the planned mountain rescue team centre providing the volunteers with a permanent base.Lidl said a large number of reports have been submitted with the planning application which confirm that the proposal will have no ldquoadverse effects on the environment or amenity of local residents.In addition, the supermarket giant says its development plan will regenerate a brownfield site with ldquomodern, attractive buildings and has signicant economic benefits.Objectors to the new store proposal claim that there are ldquoserious errors in the transport assessment submitted in conjunction with the application, inaccurate land ownership information, unachievable visibility spays and out-of-season traffic surveys.In addition, it will be argued today that in determining the planning application and making a recommendation to councillors, the local authority has done so without a thorough assessment having been undertaken and without being furnished with all the necessary information required to support a robust decision that the ldquoproposal to build on any particular site is acceptable, in principle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Plea.jpg","title":"Plea for opt in organ donation discussions  ","story":"LOCAL politicians are to examine how they can promote the importance of organ donation.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is working with the South Eastern and Southern health trusts on the issue, with many councillors keen to see plans for an opt out system.This means that people would agree to donate their organs with those who do not wish to do this signing a register. However, this does not currently exist.At Monday nightrsquos monthly meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, a letter from the Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health confirmed that there are no plans in place at present to introduce so-called opt out legislation.However, Mr Richard Pengelly said that work is continuing to achieve higher rates of donation and transplantation to ensure that more people are able to receive the gt of an organ.It is estimated that someone dies every six weeks in Northern Ireland waiting for an organ donation.At Monday nightrsquos council meeting, Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen said she was not surprised at the content of Mr Pengelleyrsquos letter, explaining that there is not much he can do without the required legislation being in place.ldquoIs there anything we can do at council level  she asked.ldquoA lot of the things we would hear on this issue from people is that it is something they have never really thought about or spoken to their family about.

Is there anything that we can do to educate people and push a bit more on this issue as far as people putting themselves on the donor register  she asked.Cllr Roisin Mulgrew said organ donation was an issue she highlighted during her year as the districtrsquos first citizen, explaining that workshops were held involving a number of young people who spoke with representatives from the ldquoBraveheart organisation.She described the event as ldquohugely successful and suggested the organ donation issue could be one for discussions across the districtrsquos DEAs.Cllr Mulgrew added: ldquoOrgan donation is a conversation families hope that they do not have to have. There is an appetite for information on this issue.Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews also backed the suggestion for the organ donation issue to be discussed at DEA level and said it should also be discussed with the Education Authority and local health trusts.Council director Michael Lipsett confirmed that he will be bringing a report on the organ donation issue to a future meeting of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee.He said the report will focus on how the council is going to approach the issue and will contain information on its work with the Public Health Authority, local health trusts and Education Authority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 PSNI.jpg","title":"PSNI helicopter used in search after attempted burglaries at weekend  ","story":"POLICE have been praised for their swt response to an incident in Killyleagh last Sunday after reports of attempted break-ins at homes in the town.A helicopter was deployed as part of a major operation which subsequently resulted in the arrest of a  year-old man near Killinchy.Connor Martin Haughey, of Forest Street, Belfast, appeared in court in Newtownards yesterday charged with a series of offences including burglary, taking and damaging a vehicle, no insurance and possessing as an article with a blade or point in a public place.The case was adjourned, with Haughey remanded in custody until January  when he is due to appear at Downpatrick Court.The ious charges he faces are in connection with burglaries in the Saintfield and Killinchy areas. It is understood he was arrested after police received a number of reports of suspicious activity in the Ringhaddy area, near Killinchy.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker has praised police for their swt response to the incident and has urged people to review their home security and ensure that their front and rear doors are locked at all times.He said a suspicious car in the Grove and Kerry estates sparked alarm last Sunday with residents calling for the police who responded swtly, deploying a number of officers, including aerial support via the PSNI helicopter.ldquoI would appeal to people to ensure that their doors are locked at all times, said Cllr Walker.ldquoI would also encourage people across the district to check in with their elderly neighbours and remind them to never open their doors to strangers.ldquoPolice were swtly on the scene in Killyleagh last Sunday which was very reassuring for residents who very much appreciated the quick response, he continued.The Rowallane politician also encouraged elderly residents in particular not to open their doors to strangers.He said residents concerned about people calling at their homes should always be asked to show their ID accreditation for the organisation they claim to represent.ldquoVirtually all staff from ious organisations now carry ID cards which feature a photograph of the person carrying it.

Work in the area is expected to take around four weeks to complete.Phoenix says while it understands that its planned programme of work will cause some disruption, it will take all relevant measures to mitigate this. In addition, the company says it is pleased that the interest levels from homeowners in Downpatrick wishing to connect to the gas network have been consistently strong.In a letter to local politicians, Phoenix says that it continues to receive regular queries from householders that donrsquot currently have access to the mains network, encouraging the company to make gas available as quickly as possible.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has asked residents and commuters in the town to remain patient as work on the multi-million pound scheme continues to provide householders and businesses access to a new form of energy.ldquoPhoenix has written to residents who are most likely to be affected by the next phase of pipe-laying to ensure that they are fully aware of what is being proposed, he continued.ldquoThe company recognises that its investment does result in disruption but is quick to resolve issues when they arise. The poundm investment across East Down to deliver natural gas is very signicant.Cllr Curran also praised Phoenix for its engagement with residents and the business community as it rolls out its pipe-laying programme across the county town in particular.The Downpatrick councillor has also confirmed that he plans to contact Phoenix officials to discuss the potential for weekend working as part of the drive to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said while the arrival of natural gas has been welcomed in many quarters, Phoenix faces the unenviable task of delivering a y construction scheme while keeping residents and business owners reasonably happy.He added: ldquoThe company has done its very best to date and there is no doubt that delivering the natural gas network is challenging. It is also not without its dficulties at times due to ious factors outside the companyrsquos control.ldquoAs work continues this week and over the months ahead, it is important that people remain patient and understanding as contractors get on with the job of providing consumers with increased choice when it comes to selecting their energy provider..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Twelfth.jpg","title":"Twelfth child for Saintfield couple  ","story":"MEET the Donoghues mdash now officially the largest family in Northern Ireland.The Saintfield family entered the record books when baby daughter Molly mdash their th child mdash arrived on New Yearrsquos Day.Molly, who weighed lb oz, was born at the Ulster Hospital shortly after  noon last Wednesday.Dad Johnand mum Tessa , were thrilled to introduce little Molly to her  siblings ndash six brothers and five sisters mdash who waited excitedly to welcome her home.Saying good night in the Donoghue household sounds more like a classroom roll call.

The sides were still locked after extra-time and at the end of five penalties apiece when James McClean drilled Olympic - ahead.It was then left to Walsh to break the deadlock when he kept out Ruairi Fitzpatrickrsquos well-struck spot kick to seal victory before he was mobbed by his delighted team-mates.Rathfriland certainly looked the part early doors as they sprayed the ball to both flanks where Fitzpatrick and Thomas Lockhart took full advantage.Fitzpatrick, in particular, ran at Dalton Tate at every opportunity, but Rathfriland failed to take advantage of his wing trickery.The first real shot in anger came in the th minute when Olympicrsquos Anton McGrattan tested Parr, but the big custodian saved with ease.Five minutes later at the other end Dalton Tate produced a telling tackle on the edge of the six yard box to deny Fitzpatrick a certain goal.However, from the resulting corner, Stephen Hughes bundled the ball over the line when Lockhartrsquos delivery caused mayhem.Rathfriland continued to play the ball methodically through the middle where Andy Kilmartin and Hughes were dominant and with  minutes gone they teamed up with Fitzpatrick to carve out another opening for Harry Campbell, but he shot straight at Walsh.Ruairi Cunningham then created an opening for Fitzpatrick, but he was way off target as was Lockhart in the th minute. A minute later at the opposite end Jason Noade got on the end of a McGrattan corner, but headed over.It looked asRathfriland were going to take their - lead into the break as the game entered the th minute and good value they were for their lead.However, with  minutes gone Stefan Mason exploded into le. The rangy striker took on two Rathfriland defenders after picking up a long ball out of defence.He headed down the left flank and looked destined for the by-line, but stopped in his tracks, checked back, turned his markers and curled a lsquoworldyrsquo into the top corner of the net, giving Parr no chance.Two minutes later it was - Olympic and again Mason was involved. When his attempted cross was blocked, McGrattan headed the ball into Nathan Jonesrsquo path.Nothing looked on when Jones got the ball centrally, just inside the box, but he managed to get the ball from under his feet and beat Parr all ends up with a stunning finish and turn the game on its head.The second half was every bit as competitive, but Olympic seemed to have the measure of Rathfriland and were playing well within themselves until Peter Telford was given the freedom of the box and allowed to head in a Lockhart free kick to make it - in the rd minute.Jason Noade then headed a Jones free kick at lsquokeeper Parr and with  minutes played the busy McGrattan fired over after a nice build-up.Another searing run and cross from Fitzpatrick begged to be put away, but Rathfriland lacked a fox in the box and the chance was gone.Chances continued to be created at either end and with the respective lsquokeepers earning their corn with brilliant saves.However, the game was in the nd minute when Walsh came to Olympicrsquos rescue when he somehow kept out an effort from Marty Havern when the former Glenavon striker seemed certain to win the game for Rathfriland. Two periods of extra-time came and went before the dreaded penalty shoot-out took centre stage.Jones, Stevie and Jason Noade, McGrattan, Tate and James McClean netted for Olympic with Kilmartin, Johnny Roy, Nigel Prentice, Ruari Cunningham and Daryll Evans replying for Rathfriland before Walsh saved the day when he beat away Fitzpatrickrsquos penalty.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Paul Dickson, Jason Noade, Anton McGrattan, Nathan Jones, Stevie Noade, Chris McNamara, Stefan Mason, Conor Reid, Ryan Molloy.

But they feel very strongly about this issue and are prepared to sacrice a dayrsquos pay to make their point. It is important to remember that the ongoing strike is not just about pay parity, it is also about safe staffing levels.Mr McConnell said NHS workers have watched staff leave ious aspects of the service and not be replaced which has left the provision of health and social services at ldquocrisis point with all services affected.He said staff have tended to keep their heads down to deliver services, explaining that they are now saying ldquoenough is enough.The Unison officials said while their members continue to go the extra mile for patients, this is impacting on their physical, emotional and psychological health.Mrs Ritchie added: ldquoStaff family lives are being affected and they have simply had enough, especially as they are being paid thousands of pounds less a year than their counterparts across the water.Mr McConnell added: ldquoThe bottom line is that the goodwill of staff has come to an end.

The people wanted a fair and balanced deal. They wanted progress. This agreement delivers progress in a balanced way. It enables us to re-establish an Executive to deal with the waiting lists in our hospitals and ensure local ministers make local decisions. I understand some people will be frustrated by the establishment of an Irish language Commissioner but it is part of an overarching cultural deal. Before anyone rushes to judgement, they should consider that this Commissioner will have a much more limited role than that which the Irish language lobby would have liked.This Commissioner will facilitate Irish language speakers but will not have the power to impose Irish upon those of us who do not speak the language.The law will require any standards drawn up by the Commissioner to be submitted to the First and Deputy First Minister for approval.Fundamental for us was that one identity was not elevated above another.The delivery of a Commissioner for the Ulster British identity enables better recognition for those of us who are British, especially in Councils in the West.Our British identity is much more than flags, bonfires, and parades. Huge work needs done here.This new Ulster British Commissioner is key to that.The Castlereagh Foundation which is established through this deal will also help create a civic voice for those of us who are British which can provide research and educational material. This is a long-term strategic win..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The establishment of a Cultural and Community Fund is about recognising and supporting the halls, bands and heritage which form the fabric of many of our communities.For too long they have been aided by start stop schemes.This will be strategic. Another win is the establishment of a Commissioner for Veterans and the implementation of the Military Covenant.For too long our soldiers and veterans have been second class to their counterparts in the rest of the United kingdom.It is right that the Executive supports the provision of care and services for young people who serve in the Armed Forces. Whilst several parties wanted to get rid of the Petition of Concern for minorities, we have ensured this key protection is retained.We have also ensure that all government buildings and courts are aligned with the rest of the UK when it comes to flying the Union Flag.This will increase the number of days the flag flies and brings us into line with GB.Whilst there will be scaremongering, those people should be asked for their achievable alternative way forward.English remains the language of Northern Ireland.No one will be forced to learn Irish.No one will be blocked from getting a job in the civil service because they don’t have Irish.There will be no positive discrimination in favour of Irish speakers. This isn’t a perfect deal but it is a fair and balanced deal to allow us to move forward and focus on the issues which matter to most people such as their schools and hospitals.Stormont back as DUP and Sinn Fein climb down Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingNI snow alert -

However it is not yet clear whether the UUP or Alliance will do so.The huge deal and proposed legislation comes to more than , words.

Northern Ireland Julian Smithand Tanaiste Simon Coveney at Stormont House in Belfast, during the talksAnd there is no mechanism to prevent a party collapsing the Executive and preventing the restoration of devolution until they are happy with what they are offered, as has happened after Sinn Féin walked out of Stormont in January .The deal sets out a host of signicant policies, some of them in areas which had not been thought to be part of the talks:l All “widely used” public websites will have to be available in Irish and public sector information and forms will have to be available in Irish “where required”.Sam McBride: There is pain in this document for both DUP and Sinn Fein Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"lThe  ban on Irish in court will be repealed, it will be made possible to register births, marriages and deaths in Irish, and wills will be able to be made in Irish.l Additional money will be found for Ulster Scots and Irish language broadcast funds, as well as the creation of Irish and Ulster Scots commissioners.l MLAs will be allowed to speak entirely in Irish or Ulster Scots and there will be on-hand simultaneous translation – presumably through headsets, as in the European Parliament – for MLAs who do not speak the language.l There will be UK-wide legislation to further incorporate the Armed Forces Covenant into law and support full implementation of the Armed Forces Covenant and a Northern Ireland Veterans’ Commissioner.   l Stormont will create a “Culture and Community fund” to give money to “ious groups in the expression of culture, arts and heritage and community halls and bands”.l There will be three extra designated days on which the Union Flag will fly from public buildings.l An Ad-Hoc Assembly Committee and a  of five experts will be established to consider “the creation of a Bill of Rights that is faithful to the stated intention of the  Agreement in that it contains rights supplementary to those contained in the European Convention on Human Rights...and that reflect the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland”.l There will be unspecied  “strengthening” of “the rules and awareness around whistleblowing” and the insertion of three independent lay members on the Assembly Committee on Standards and Privileges, which investigates complaints against MLAs. l A change to the Civil Service Code to state explicitly that officials should be present at all ministerial meetings and keep a record of discussions, with details of meetings published.l A review of funding for opposition parties, but no guarantee as to what funding they will receive.     \u2028l The creation of a ‘compact advisory ’ to advise the Executive.There are also a series of pledges as to what the new Executive will do. It promises no-one waiting over a year at September ,  for outpatient or inpatient assessment or treatment will still be on a waiting list by March .The new executive is also committed to creating a Gender Strategy, Sexual Orientation Strategy, Irish Language Strategy and an Ulster Scots Strategy.There are no proposals to cut the number – or the salaries of up to £, a year – of Stormont’s small army of special advisers .The deal also hints at quite signicant educational reform, saying that the current multi-sector education system in Northern Ireland “is not sustainable” and there needs to be “sharing,cooperation and integration”.And there is agreement to implement major health reforms which will see unpopular decisions such as smaller local hospitals being downgraded or closed in favour of centres of excellence, something which medical experts agree improves health outcomes.However, much of the immediate focus will be on the issue which for almost three years has been at the heart of the dispute between the DUP and Sinn Féin – the Irish language act.The deal will see legislation to create a commissioner to “recognise, support, protect and enhance the development of the Irish language...and to provide official recognition of the status of the Irish Language”.That will sit alongside an Ulster Scots commissioner ”to enhance and develop the language, arts and literature associated with the Ulster Scots Ulster British tradition and to provide official recognition of the status of the Ulster Scots language”.The legislation will also place a legal duty on the Department of Education to “encourage and facilitate the use of Ulster Scots in the education system”.Speaking in Stormont’s Great Hall, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said: “We now have the basis to restore powersharing, and we’re up for that”.Ms McDonald responded to Irish language activists disappointed with the weak legislation. She insisted it was only a start, predicting that more gains for language would come in the future. “I would say to Irish language activists take heart from the fact that this is now a historic moment because for the first time we have official recognition,” she said.try catch  TrendingNI snow alert -

Michelle ONeillof Sinn Fein with Conor Murphy, Minister of Finance and Sinn Fein President, Mary Lou McDonaldat Parliament Buildings, Stormont, BelfastThe DUP leader said there was plenty of blame to go around for the three-year powersharing impasse, but she insisted it was now time to look to the future.Signicantly, given one of the key disputes at the heart of political crisis, Ms Foster made reference to an Irish language phrase in a speech that struck a conciliatory tone and stressed the need to work together going forward.“We have many dferences - Michelle’s narrative of the past  years could not be more dferent to mine,” she said.“I’m not sure we will ever agree on much about the past, but we can agree there was too much suffering, and that we cannot allow society to drt backwards and allow ision to grow.“Northern Ireland is succeeding in many ways. It’s time for Stormont to move forward and show that ‘together we are stronger’ for the benefit of everyone.”Despite the titles, Ms Foster and Ms O’Neill hold equal standing at the top of the ministerial executive.Ms O’Neill said it was a “defining moment” for the region. She said she was honoured to follow in the footsteps of the late Martin McGuinness and become deputy first minister.Three years after Sinn Féin walked out of Stormont, Arlene Foster s as First Minister Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“After three years without ing institutions with the five parties forming the new Executive, it is my hope that we do so united in our determination to deliver a stable power-sharing coalition that works on the basis of openness, transparency and accountability, and in good faith and with no surprises,” she said.The Prime Minister said it was a “momentous day”.“As we begin a new decade, we can now look forward to a brighter future for all in Northern Ireland with an Executive that can transform public services and improve people’s lives,” said Mr Johnson.Mr Varadkar hailed the politicians for backing the deal.“I look forward to working with representatives in Northern Ireland as they begin working together again on behalf of all people in Northern Ireland,” said the Taoiseach.Bill Clinton said he was “thankful” to see the Assembly restored.The current US administration also welcomed the deal, with UK ambassador Robert Wood Johnson insisting the US would remain a “friend and partner” of the people of Northern Ireland.The DUP’s Diane Dodds is Economy minister, Peter Weir is Education minister and Edwin Poots is Agriculture minister.Sinn Fein’s Conor Murphy is the new Finance minister, while party colleague Deirdre Hargey is the minister at the Department of Communities.The SDLP’s Nichola Mallon is Infrastructure minister while former Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann is the new Health minister.Alliance did not have the electoral strength to take up a ministry by right but the DUP and Sinn Fein invited the cross-community party to fill the justice ministry - which is allocated by a dferent process to the other portfolios.The DUP’s Gordon Lyons and Sinn Fein’s Declan Kearney were selected as junior ministers in Ms Foster and Ms O’Neill’s Executive Office.Sinn Fein’s Alex Maskey had been elected as the new speaker of the Assembly, while the DUP’s Christopher Stalford, Ulster Unionist Roy Beggs and the SDLP’s Patsy McGlone are deputy speakers.The inclusion of all five of the main parties in the executive is a signicant development.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record.

I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo. Picture date: Saturday November , . See PA story IRISH SinnFein. Photo credit should read: Brian Lawless PA WireThe order’s comments came after an interview by Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald where she was asked about the matter.“The Orange Institution is not interested in engaging in ‘conversations’ or responding to hypothetical statements which merely assist Sinn Fein and nationalists as they continue to ‘talk up’ the inevitability of a united Ireland,” an Orange spokesman said.“Orangemen in many communities across Ireland have experienced Republicanism’s intolerance and hatred first-hand. Ironically, despite these comments, recent developments in the Republic of Ireland have shown us the reality that Sinn Fein and others are not really interested in equality – or the historical commemoration of anything deemed to be British.”Ms McDonald had told the Irish Independent she was willing to put celebrating the Twelfth of July across the island of Ireland on the table in talks about a future Border poll.She said “everything should be on the table” when asked specically about annual celebration.“I’ll tell you how we do it, we do it by having them [unionists] front and centre in the conversation and asking them, because I would be absolutely astonishedfor people of a unionist persuasion the issue around the Twelfth of July was not raised,” she said.“We, more than any other political party in the Oireachtas, are used to working with, living with, dealing with our unionist neighbours and the Twelfth of July is very widely celebrated.”Ms McDonald’s comments were made before the current controversy over the now-postponed Irish state commemoration of the Royal Irish Constabulary and Dublin politan Police. Sinn Féin led calls for the event to be cancelled altogether amid concerns it amounts to celebrating the Black and Tans.While acknowledging Sinn Féin supporters may not favour marking the Twelfth, Ms McDonald believes people will “surprise themselves” with what they find acceptable in a united Ireland.“Generally speaking, people are decent and reasonable and they want a good le for themselves and for their families and they are happy to accommodate and respect their neighbours so long as that accommodation and respect comes back to them,” she said. “They’re kind of the go-to issues when people talk about Irish unity, and that’s fine. Bring all of that to the table. Let’s talk about it.”While critics claim she is not in control and Sinn Féin is still run out of west Belfast, the paper said, she insisted Gerry Adams “doesn’t pull my strings, nobody’s pulling my strings”.Ms McDonald also declined to express regret for proclaiming “up the rebels” and “tiocfaidh ár lá” when she took over as leader. “No,” she said when asked about using militant Republican language. “Up the rebels.”LBC journalist and NI man Matthew Thompson tweeted: “That’s nice and all. But you’d think allowing unionists one day of the year to celebrate their heritage would be the least they might expect from a united Ireland.”In  former Sinn Fein TD Peadar Toibin said he was not sure the time was right for southern Orangemen to parade in their capital, saying there is “a broken relationship” with the order which needs work to be fixed.TUV Councillor Matthew Armstrong said the Orange community would treat the offer “with the contempt its deserves”.\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"portadown businessman sam hewitt enjoyed colourful life well lived ","story":"Shops get drop in rates but pubs see a large spikeWhirlpool urged to refund customers as recall of more than , fire-risk models begins - full list of models recalledNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPortadown businessman Sam Hewitt enjoyed a colourful le well-livedWhen Sam Hewitt ran the Superglaze firm in Bridge Street, Portadown, everyone knew him as ‘Super Sam’.By The NewsroomWednesday, th January , : pmUpdated Wednesday, th January , : pm\"Sam Hewitt as drawn by Billy Austin.And that is how he will be remembered as hundreds of his friends mourn his passing.Sam died in Craigavon Hospital on Sunday afternoon after a brief illness and as family and friends reflect on a colourful le well-lived they will all remember Sam with much affection.Sam was  and he and his we, Margaret, lived at Annahugh House, Kilmore, one of the oldest houses in County Armagh. Sam, the third child of Norman and Jean Hewitt,was raised on a farm at Moneypennys and it was there thathis love for the outdoor le was nurtured. He would often recall his early days there, telling stories of sailing to Portadown along the canal on his canoe and spending hours in the fields observing the wildle along the river banks. It was there too that his spirit of adventure developed which ultimately led to a career in the Royal Air Force and a posting to Germany where he served for three years, developing a love for that country. That career was relived when the family gave him a trip in a Spitfire for his th birthday and Sam was delighted when the trip was featured on Anne Marie McAleese’s Radio Ulster programme Your Place and Mine. Having obtained a pilot’s licence earlier in le he enjoyed lots of flying time from Aldergrove and there were frequent trips to the Isle of Man with his we, Margaret, and daughter Claire.As a child and teenager Sam developed a close relationship with local horse dealers, the Hamill family, and this gave him the opportunity to ride horses, which became a le-long passion, passed on to daughter Claire and grandchildren Olivia and Rocco.Family was the most important aspect of Sam’s le and he and Margaret had three children, Claire, born in , Reuben in i and Samuel in . He was totally devoted to them, opening up opportunities for each ofthem to pursue a range of activities ranging from horse-riding to fishing and motor bikes and all sorts of watersports. And although Samuel was based in England there was nothing he enjoyed more than to arrive at Annahugh House and see his children play with the model trains Sam had so lovingly built.Because of his love for horses Sam was involved in the founding of the Armagh Horse and Pony Club and instigated pony camps for children in the Mourne Mountains. Until recently he wasa constant supporter of grandchildren Robin, Alex and Jude at rugby and cricket. Sam’s career was as colourful as his le. On leaving the Air Force he worked at Quintin Castle in Portaferry as the land steward where he continued his horse riding and began to sail and fish in Strangford Lough. Then he was a car salesman with Allens Automart, where he formed a lasting friendship with the owner, George Allen, and John Ford he dabbled for a while as a carpet salesman with Cyril Lord’s Carpets, then there was a spell as a paint salesman in Bridge Street before he went into business on his own with the Superglaze business in Meadow Lane. And all the while Sam’s infectious enthusiasm for whatever he did warmed him to everyone with whom he came in contact, forming a close relationship with the late Victor Locke who had emigrated to Hong Kong. Debonair Sam was an immaculate dresser and had a wardrobe to fit every occasion, whether it was a wedding, a funeral, a formal invitation or a sporting occasion and he stood out from a crowd with his sleek, silver hair.He was also a car enthusiast, his interest having been fostered at Allen’s Automart and he cut a dash as he enjoyed top-range sports cars over the years. Travel was another of his passions and he had been to Vietnam, Africa, America, where he toured the Grand Canyon, Thailand, Hong Kong andChina  But Sam will be best remembered for his friendship and there have been many tributes to him. He enjoyed his weeklylunch date with a group of friends, a get-together that been going on for some  years and one of that gathering, Ron Mullen, said, “Sam was a one-off. He was a wonderful friend and he always had the ability to brighten any gathering, no matter the circumstances. He will be sadly missed.”Retired school headmaster Jim Smart’s friendship with Sam goes back over  years and Jim said, “Sam was a frequent visitor to our house in Mandeville Street where my father ran a potato business. My mother always had the teapot on and we enjoyed seeing Sam arrive and giving us a bit of the fun that was part of his character.”Sam brought fun no matter where he went but he had his serious side too and his RAF training in discipline and decorum could come into play when the occasion demanded. He was comfortable in any gathering and was equally at home discussing world affairs or more mundane matters at home.People like George Allen, Ralph Loney and Mervyn Gilpin, all known for their Christian views, were among Sam’s best friends, even though he didn’t share all their views, but there was mutual respect on all sides and their friendship grew over the years.“Sam was a deep thinker and liked to argue his case,” said Mervyn. “I don’t think we ever saw eye to eye but we had a friendship that could never be broken and we all held him in the highest regard.” Sam is survived by his we, Margaret, daughter Claire, sons Reuben and Samuel, son-in-law Mark, daughters-in-law Zara and Lucy grandchildren Robin, Olivia, Alex, Rocco, Jude, Charlie and William, sister, Jeanette and brother Trevor.The funeral is to Roselawn Crematorium on Friday at pm and donations in lieu of flowers are to Help the Heroes, c oJoseph Poots funeral directors, , Bridge Street, Portadown. BT RAThe family wishes to place on record their sincere thanks to the doctors and nurses at Craigavon Hospital for all their care and attention to Sam during his short stay there.\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"shops get drop rates pubs see large spike ","story":"A full ‘Wolf Moon’ will appear alongside the lunar eclipse in the UK tonight - here’s how to see itPortadown businessman Sam Hewitt enjoyed a colourful le well-livedNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsShops get drop in rates but pubs see a large spikeSome retailers and banks in Portadown are to benefit from a drop in rates while a number of pubs face a signicant increase in their bills.By The NewsroomFriday, th January , : pm\"Portadown Town Centre.A new business rates valuation has been announced by Land and Property Services this week - the first shake up since .Chamber of Commerce President Adrian Farrell said the reduction in rates for some retailers was ‘a step in the right direction’.However he voiced concerns at the sharp rise in rates for some businesses in the hospitality sector.At least one licenced premises close to the town centre has seen their rateable value shoot up by almost % and will be expected to pay almost £k extra per annum.Another town centre bar will see a leap of % on their rates, and will be expected to pay more than £k extra each year. Even local churches will see a hike in rates with some payments rising by almost %.Meanwhile at least one bank will have their rates reduced by more than % and will pay £k per year less.Many shops in Market Street have had their rates slashed substantially, some by as much as %. A kiosk in High Street Mall will have its annual rates reduced by half.There doesn’t appear to be any change to the rates at the Meadows Shopping Centre while Rushmere Shopping Centre will see a rise of almost %.At least one outlet in Magowan Buildings will have a rates rise of almost % though others will see no change. ASDA will benefit from a drop in rates from £,, to £, - a drop of £k. Tesco Extra in Craigavon will see a % drop in its bill from £,, to £,, - a decrease of £kBucking the trend in the hospitality sector is the Seagoe Hotel which sees no change to its rateable value.The Omniplex Cinema in Craigavon will see the rates rise by almost % from £k to £k.Portadown Fire Station will also see a rates hike of almost % but Cascades Leisure Centre next door, which is due to close, will see a % drop in rates.Portadown Health Centre will see a drop of almost % in rates in April down from £, to £, - a drop of £,.Mr Farrell said: “I think this is a step in the right direction but I have concerns about the rise in rates in the hospitality sector.”He added that there needed to be a ‘radical reform’ of the ‘flawed rates system’ and called for online retailers to contribute to the rates system.In total draft valuations for all , businesses in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area have been published online.Known as Reval – this process will result in a new non-domestic Valuation List being used to calculate business rate bills from April . The Department of Finance said: “This process is about restoring fairness in the rating system by redistributing basically the same rating burden using more up-to-date values. A revaluation is not about collecting more money from businesses, but it is about ensuring that everyone pays their fair share.” Business rates are charged on most non-domestic premises including shops, offices, warehouses, factories, hotels and pubs as well as utilities such as gas, water, electricity and wind farms.The results show a modest growth in the total value in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area of .% compared to the current Valuation List which is based on  values. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary at Department of Finance said: “The revaluation means that from April, ratepayers will contribute to the funding of essential public services such as health, education and infrastructure as well as a wide range of council services relative to their  rental value, instead of  values as at present.“The growth in the total value of the Valuation List does not translate into a corresponding overall increase in rate bills. I will be seeking to ensure that the regional business rate poundage that we set is lowered to reflect the overall growth in the Valuation List. I will also be encouraging councils to do the same in respect of district rate poundages reflecting the fact that revaluation is not about raising more revenue overall from rates.”If rate poundages are adjusted downwards by both central government and district councilsthis would mean up to % of business ratepayers would either see a reduction or little or no change in their rate bill.Encouraging business ratepayers to view the draft schedule of values, Sue added: “I’m delighted that for the first time we are making the draft valuation list available on our Spatial NI . This will provide ratepayers with greater detail including a breakdown of how their value has been calculated as well as seeing the same information for similar properties in their local area and indeed for all similar properties across Northern Ireland. This approach makes the rating system much more transparent – which is absolutely the right thing to do.“I would encourage business ratepayers to go online and view the new draft values for their properties ahead of rate bills issuing in April.”Preliminary outcomes of the revaluation include:a modest growth in the total value in Northern Ireland of .% many high street shops and some shopping centres will see a decrease in rateable value, with some as much as %many of the edge of town retail parks will remain constant some of the largest food stores show a decrease in rateable value of between % and %the office sector shows an overall increase in rateable value of % andthe pub trade will see considerable iation in values with notable decreases in some pubs and signicant increases in some pubs in busy urban areas.As well as being able to view their new valuation online at a time that suits them, business owners can come along and talk to the Reval team at events across Northern Ireland to find out more about what their new valuation means for them. View the draft schedule of values at www.finance-ni.gov.uk reval--niIf ratepayers are unable to access the required information online they can contact LPS on Tel:   .

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business urging cross party political backing to restore assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community is urging cross-party political backing for a deal which could see the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
