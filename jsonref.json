something Labour has cast doubt on saying that hundreds of thousands of tests had already been carried out in the UK by mid-April. He also tried to bat away questions by suggesting they are best considered in the public inquiry, which will not begin until next year. \u0027There will be a time when we can go into this in detail,\u0027 he said. Earlier, Mr Hancock told the Commons that Mr Cummings\u0027 barrage of allegations - including that he lied repeatedly, failed care home residents and should have been \u0027sacked daily\u0027 - were \u0027not true\u0027 and he had been \u0027straight with people\u0027.  Mr Cummings said Mr Hancock \u0027categorically\u0027 told colleagues in March that people would be tested before being returned to homes.But the former aide said they \u0027subsequently found out that that hadn\u0027t happened\u0027. According to ITV, Mr Cummings has documents showing the PM\u0027s office summoned Mr Hancock to No10 on May 3 last year, for a meeting the following day, to explain whether he had misled the chief aide, the PM and then Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill on the testing of patients before discharge into care homes, as well as about further testing of residents and staff.The DoH said it \u0027did not recognise\u0027 the claim and Mr Hancock \u0027had many meetings with the PM across a range of issues\u0027. Mr Hancock was asked yesterday if he could say he protected care homes, and was also pressed if he made the commitment on testing.He replied: \u0027We worked as hard as we could to protect people who live in care homes, and of course those who live in care homes are some of the most vulnerable to this disease because by its nature it attacks and has more of an impact on older people.\u0027Now when it comes to the testing of people as they left hospital and went into care homes, we committed to building the testing capacity to allow that to happen.\u0027Of course it then takes time to build testing capacity.\u0027In fact, one of the critical things we did was set the 100,000 target back then to make sure we built that testing capacity and it was very effective in doing so.\u0027And then we were able to introduce the policy of testing everybody before going into care homes, but we could only do that once we had the testing capacity which I had to build, because we didn\u0027t have it in this country from the start.\u0027We started with a capacity of less than 2,000 in March last year and got to 100,000 tests a day.\u0027And we set all of this out at the time in public documents. It\u0027s all a matter of public record.\u0027On a visit to Colchester hospital yesterday, Mr Johnson said the government faced an \u0027incredibly difficult series of decisions, none of which we have taken lightly\u0027 and \u0027at every stage we have been governed by a determination to protect life\u0027. Challenged whether the government\u0027s failures had cost tens of thousands of lives as Mr Cummings claims, he said: \u0027No I don\u0027t think so. But, of course, this has been an incredibly difficult series of decisions, none of which we\u0027ve taken lightly.\u0027 He said the situation in care homes - where more than 40,000 deaths were linked to Covid - was \u0027tragic\u0027, but added: \u0027We did everything we could to protect the NHS and to protect care homes as well.\u0027He said: \u0027I think it\u0027s important for us to focus on what really matters to the people of this country.\u0027I think, if I may say so, that some of the commentary I have heard doesn\u0027t bear any relation to reality.\u0027What people want us to get on with is delivering the road map and trying – cautiously – to take our country forward through what has been one of the most difficult periods that I think anybody can remember.\u0027 Summoned to answer an urgent question in the House yesterday morning, Mr Hancock said: \u0027These unsubstantiated allegations around honesty are not true. \u0027I have been straight with people in public and in private throughout.\u0027 Mr Hancock also dismissed Mr Cummings\u0027 criticism of his testing target, saying it was \u0027how you get stuff done in government\u0027.\u0027I am proud of everyone in my department,\u0027 he said. In a brutal swipe at the ex-No10 chief, who was ousted from Downing Street in November, he said people can see that over the past six months \u0027governing has become a little easier and we have been able to deliver\u0027. Tory MPs rallied round Mr Hancock in the chamber, with William Wragg slamming the \u0027irony\u0027 of criticism from Mr Cummings, and Peter Bone dismissing him as an \u0027unelected Spad who broke Covid regulations\u0027. Mr Bone said the premier\u0027s mistake was that he \u0027didn\u0027t fire Dominic Cummings early enough\u0027.  Red Wall MP Dehenna Davison also made her feelings clear as she asked a question by video link with a \u0027Barnard Castle eye test\u0027 chart in the background.   Government sources have called the onslaught from Mr Cummings a \u0027character assassination\u0027 that was \u0027not backed by evidence\u0027.Senior Tories told MailOnline that the former No10 chief was engaged in epic \u0027score settling\u0027 and had a \u0027selective memory\u0027. \u0027He should really have words with whoever was in charge last year,\u0027 one said wryly. Mr Hancock told the Commons yesterday: \u0027Every day since I began working on the response to this pandemic last January, I\u0027ve got up each morning and asked: \u0027What must I do to protect life?\u0027\u0027That is the job of the Health Secretary in a pandemic.\u0027We\u0027ve taken an approach of openness, transparency and explanation of both what we know and of what we don\u0027t know.\u0027He said he had updated the House 60 times during pandemic, and \u0027answered questions from colleagues, the media and the public\u0027.Launching a dramatic bid to bring down the Prime Minister and the Health Secretary on Wednesday, Mr Cummings blamed a toxic mix of complacency and indecision for the needless deaths.He told MPs that senior ministers and advisers, including himself, had fallen \u0027disastrously short\u0027, adding: \u0027When the public needed us most, the Government failed. Tens of thousands of people died, who didn\u0027t need to die.\u0027In an extraordinary seven-hour performance, Mr Cummings launched attacks on Mr Johnson, his fiancée Carrie Symonds and Mr Hancock over their personal conduct during the crisis. Mr Cummings claimed the Prime Minister was \u0027unfit for the job\u0027 and could not lead Britain out of the pandemic.He said the Health Secretary \u0027should have been fired for at least 15 to 20 things, including lying\u0027. He alleged Mr Hancock had lied to the PM over the disastrous policy of not testing older people for Covid before they were discharged from hospital into care homes. The former No10 aide outlined a series of failings by him and the \u0027smoking ruin\u0027 Department for Health, including lying in January last year that pandemic preparations were brilliant when they were \u0027completely hollow\u0027."},{"url":null,"title":"More half Britons NOT hugged friend relative restrictions eased","story":"Share this article However, the R\u0026ampWS poll for MailOnline shows that most people understand how it works and what the restrictions are.Two two-thirds (67 per cent) said they understood the guidance, against a third (33 per cent) who did not. And more than six-in-10 (61 per cent) understood that travel to amber list countries like France, Spain and Italy was against Government guidelines but not illegal.Just 8 per cent though it was still illegal and 10 per cent didn\u0027t know what the situation was.More than half 53 per cent said the traffic light system was easy to understand but 39 per cent thought it was confusing."},{"url":null,"title":"Coronavirus UK review international travel green list week","story":"Share this article Crowds were pictured flocking to airports for the first time in months when flying abroad became legal again in May, but most are holding off on holidays.Top scientists have said they would avoid international travel and government ministers have discouraged it, urging people to make plans at home instead or, if they do want to go abroad, to stick to green list nations.       On Monday Business Minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan said on Times Radio: \u0027The reality is, at the moment, amber countries are still not meeting the criteria for our scientists to say that they should be green.\u0027So the recommendation remains don\u0027t go unless you have to, and remember that, if you do go, you will have to quarantine for 10 days and that will be monitored.\u0027 Grant Shapps told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today last week: \u0027The amber list and the red list are not for holidaymakers, that\u0027s not the purpose of those lists at this time.\u0027We just think that after a year of lockdowns in this country, of people coming forward in record numbers to get their vaccines, we do not want to be in a position of taking risks at this stage about our unlock.\u0027Asked if he was pushing for the green list to be extended he said: \u0027Of course.

A study carried out by Essity in the past year found that incontinence was seen as even more difficult to discuss than depression. Many doctors speak of male patients using their wives’ sanitary pads so they don’t end up with a soggy pair of boxers, or staying indoors due to “bladder leash” – the fear of not being able to locate a loo when leaving the house. When is male incontinence most likely to strike?There are different types of incontinence, with men most likely to experience “urge incontinence”. If you’ve ever felt a strong, unexplained impulse to pee, but find you’ve only got a few seconds to sprint to the bathroom, it’s probably urge incontinence. That’s why some men suffer “latchkey incontinence”, the sensation that the floodgates are about to open the moment you twist the key in your front door. Our internal plumbing is usually to blame for leakage, particularly overactive detrusor muscles. When these muscles contract too often (perhaps because you’ve had too much alcohol, too few fluids or even because you’re constipated), it can result in an uncontrollable urge to urinate at unforeseen moments, such as when you hear running water. Other factors that may make it harder to avoid dampness down under include being overweight or having had surgery for prostate cancer, which can result in weakened muscles. Men are also likely to experience post-micturition dribble, which causes a map-like stain to form on underpants after urinating. It’s often down to weakened pelvic floor muscles. What other types of incontinence are there?Men can also experience stress incontinence. That’s not “stress” as in feeling overwhelmed by a bulging inbox, but “stress” as in pressure. It happens when the bladder is put under sudden strain, such as coughing, sneezing, laughing or lifting weights in the gym, all of which can cause urine to leak, possibly because the pelvic floor muscles are weak. Incontinence can also be caused by overflow incontinence (also known as chronic urinary retention). This is when the bladder doesn’t entirely empty, resulting in a man passing small trickles of urine regularly, along with a feeling that the bladder is constantly full. How can I manage my incontinence so I can lead a normal life again?For starters, go and get a checkup with your GP to help you find out the cause. A trip to your GP may result in you being prescribed a course of antibiotics, or given advice on how lifestyle choices (see below) could alleviate symptoms. Until that’s addressed, and any changes kick in, many men have found the easiest way to manage their urine leakage is by using incontinence products, which allow them to enjoy the social activities they did before. Unsure where to start? Try TENA’s free Keep Control sample pack, which arrives discreetly packaged and allows you to road-test the incontinence tech that works best for you. This could be absorbent protective pads or underpants that look just like normal boxer shorts but keep nether regions dry. What else can I do to prevent bladder attacks?Not gulping down endless cups of tea and coffee during your working day can help, as caffeine is a diuretic that can increase the amount of urine you make. That said, it’s important to drink enough fluids so try to sip plenty of water throughout the day. Eating a healthy diet and keeping to a good weight is also beneficial, as being overweight puts pressure on the bladder. And don’t forget the pelvic floor, the muscles that hold the bladder and rectum in place. Men have less active pelvic floors than women so any exercises that strengthen them, such as pilates, are great.

As Martin unveiled the government’s plans over June, July and August, he said that the reopening of society and the economy will depend on Irish people following the guidelines in place. Martin confirmed that on June 2, hotels, B\u0026ampBs, guesthouses and self-catering accommodation will reopen. On June 7, outdoor services in bars and restaurants will reopen along with cinemas and theatres. On the same date, up to 200 people can attend outdoor events in venues with a minimum capacity of 5000, and up to 100 can attend other outdoor events. The mistake of well, Shakespearean, proportions happened on Thursday night after Noelia Novillo, a newsreader on Canal 26 mixed up the Bard with William “Bill” Shakespeare, an 81-year-old Warwickshire man who became the second person in the world to get the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. William Shakespeare died in 1616, while his namesake – an inpatient in the frailty ward at University hospital, Coventry, at the time of his first vaccination – died this week from a stroke unrelated to the jab. “We would like for everyone out there to separate, if they can, the politics of this issue from the science. This whole process is being poisoned by politics,” Ryan said during a press conference, adding further studies are going to be needed to find the origins of the virus. It comes after the last WHO investigating team said a lab leak was “extremely unlikely” and not worthy of further study before the organisation head swiftly said all hypotheses in fact remained under consideration. WHO experts are preparing a proposal on the next studies to be carried out into the origins of the virus that causes Covid-19,A total of 316 cases of rare blood clots with low platelets have been recorded in adults who received AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine in the European Economic Area, an executive of the region’s drug regulator said. The figure as of yesterday includes 174 new reports since the European Medicines Agency (EMA) provided an update in April, Georgy Genov, the chief of the watchdog’s safety monitoring operations, said during a briefing today. The EMA has been looking into cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) since March and has found a possible link to the vaccine developed with Oxford University, Vaxzevria, and to Johnson \u0026amp Johnson’s single-dose shot. It has, however, maintained that overall benefits of both the vaccines outweigh any risks posed by them. Genov said a further 19 million people had received the first dose of Vaxzevria in the EEA since the April update, adding that the frequency of TTS has not changed - it is still extremely rare - but the fatality rate following symptoms has decreased. He said the drop in death rates possibly indicated that awareness among those vaccinated and those administering the vaccine and treating patients had gone up, leading to early diagnosis and treatment.Reuters reports that both numbers have been on a strong downward trend in recent weeks. The health ministry also reported 98 new coronavirus deaths in hospitals. Later, it is set to report the death tally for retirement care homes over the past three days as well as data on new cases. The World Health Organization’s regional director for Europe Hans Kluge said countries and their populations must not become complacent about the pandemic. He said France already had a partnership with South Africa’s Biovac Institute and would soon launch a project with South African pharmaceutical company Aspen. He reiterated support for waiving intellectual property rights for Covid vaccines, a move also supported by US president Joe Biden but opposed by Germany and the UK among other states.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins Thousands of people aged under 50 could be given a mixed vaccine against Covid-19, under a new approach being considered by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac).The vaccination programme could be changed to allow under-50s who have received a first dose of AstraZeneca to be given the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines as a second dose, Niac has told chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan. Niac also says it is keeping under review whether or not the interval between AstraZeneca shots should be cut from 12 weeks to eight, and is also looking at the vaccination of children with high-risk medical conditions.Earlier this year, after rare but serious blood clots were found in people who had received the AstraZeneca vaccine, Niac recommended mRNA vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna) for under-50s. However, at least 40,000 people, many of them healthcare workers, have already received a first dose of AstraZeneca and are awaiting a second dose.Niac says there is now published evidence of the safety of “heterologous” vaccine schedules, in which doses of two different vaccines are administered against Covid-19.At its meeting this week, Niac examined emerging data on very rare clotting events linked to AstraZeneca. Niac has told Dr Holohan in a letter it will review the safety of mixing vaccines as well as unpublished evidence of effectiveness.In the UK, the interval between doses of the AstraZeneca and mRNA vaccines has been cut from 12 weeks to eight due to the rise in Indian variant cases.

This includes 86 days cancelled due to personnel shortages (including some caused by Covid-19) and 44 cancelled due to mechanical issues.Four of the Naval Service’s nine vessels are currently out of action, including one which is undergoing a refit.“The high-level assessment of the level of Naval and Air Corps activity in fisheries control operations is that it has been reducing over the past number of years,” the department said in its submission.The European Commission recently ordered a formal administrative inquiry into Ireland’s ability to enforce European fishery regulations. It found Irish systems to be “unsatisfactory”. As a result the Commission “put forward a specific package of measures to address the issues raised,” the department said.These findings are under “active consideration” by the Government ahead of negotiations with the Commission on the matter.Ireland’s fishing waters are the most productive in the EU and the State has a legal responsibility to monitor and control fishing activity in its 200 mile exclusive zone, the department said. The Naval Service and Air Corps also have a “legal responsibility” to monitor the zone.Almost half a billion euro worth of fish is landed each year from the Irish zone, with Ireland taking 42 per cent of this by weight.“It is essential that there is strong and effective monitoring and control of the outtake by all vessels, Irish and non-Irish, so that the stocks are fished sustainably” it said.Overfishing will have serious short-, medium- and long-term consequences on the Irish fishing industry, which employs 14,000 people and is worth €653 million in exports, it said, adding that the Irish fleet is “highly dependent” on fishing within Irish waters.“Our fleet do not have options to move to new waters as our quota shares are primarily restricted to the fish stocks in Irish and UK waters.”In 2019, less than half of boardings by the Naval service related to Irish vessels. Spanish vessels accounted for 30 per cent, French for 11 per cent and UK vessels for nine per cent.In response to queries, the Department of Defence said Covid-19 has impacted the number of patrol days carried out this year. Although sea operations were impacted, the Naval Service’s Fisheries Monitoring Centre has continued to monitor Irish waters 247, it said.A spokeswoman added that The Naval Service “liaised closely” with the EFCA ship while it operated in the Irish zone.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"land development agency plans 22 storey housing block in dublin 8","story":"The old St Teresa’s Gardens complex, now demolished. Photograph: Bryan O’BrienThe State’s Land Development Agency (LDA) wants to build a 22-storey tower in Dublin 8 – the same height as the city’s tallest building located in the docklands.The proposed tower is part of the LDA’s plans for 700 homes on the site of the 1950s Dublin City Council flat complex St Teresa’s Gardens.The site is beside the former Player Wills cigarette factory and Bailey Gibson packaging plant on the South Circular Road, where US property group Hines was last month granted permission for a controversial 19-storey building.The LDA is redeveloping St Teresa’s Gardens on behalf of the council, which still owns the site, with 30 per cent of the homes to be retained for social housing, and 70 per cent used for a cost rental scheme aimed at low- and middle-income workers, where the rents are based on the cost of building and managing the apartments. Four buildingsThe emerging design for the development, renamed the “Donore Project”, includes four buildings, ranging in height from two to 22 storeys to “ensure an efficient use of the council’s lands in this established residential neighbourhood in a highly sustainable location”, the LDA said. The 22-storey tower would have the same number of floors as the city’s current tallest building, Kennedy Wilson’s Capital Dock tower at Sir John Rogerson’s Quay.The LDA has undertaken a consultation process with local residents’ associations, community groups and public representatives in recent months and said the feedback from this process “fed into the outline designs”. The designs are in line with a masterplan that was prepared by the council in conjunction with Hines, the LDA said.A second round of consultations will run until July 2nd with the designs due to be finalised by October and a planning application expected to be lodged in early 2022.Once one of the city’s largest council flat complexes, St Teresa’s Gardens was earmarked for regeneration in 2005, but the plan was scrapped in 2009 after the collapse of the property market.DemolishIn 2013, the council announced plans to demolish 10 of the 12-flat blocks and refurbish two blocks to create 52 modern apartments, and to build 54 more houses and apartments.Demolition began in February 2015. The refurbishment of the saved block was completed by the end of 2015. Construction of the new homes had been due to start in November 2015. However, hazardous waste was found in October 2016 and the project was put on hold until the soil was decontaminated. Construction of the houses eventually began in December 2018. In 2017, the council produced a masterplan for St Teresa’s, along with the Player Wills and Bailey Gibson sites. The latter two were then owned by Nama. However, Hines subsequently bought them, and plans to build more than 1,500 homes in three phases.

Video: RTE Taoiseach Micheál Martin at Government Buildings, Dublin The end of the pandemic is within grasp if the country can remain vigilant and “continue to make the right choices”, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said on Friday evening.In an address to the nation at Government Buildings, Mr Martin said that “after the trauma of the last 15 months, we are finally taking definite steps towards enjoying normal times with friends and loved ones again.”Announcing the widespread reopening of the economy and society, Mr Martin said: “we’re almost back to a point where we can just enjoy the ordinary extraordinary moments in our lives.”“The sense of hope, excitement, and relief is palpable. But as we watch what is happening across the globe, we of course know that we must remain vigilant against this terrible virus. We know there have been many twists and turns on this journey.“I’ve talked many times about the strength that is found and solidarity and how managing the pandemic must be a collective effort. This coming month could be the most important test of that spirit that we have faced since this ordeal began.”“If we continue to mind each other, if we continue to make the right choices, be vigilant, take our vaccine when our turn comes, if we continue to do all of these things, the end of this is within our grasp,” he said.Mr Martin asked the public to continue to exercise caution and “to trust the science.” He said that while the Government’s approach has been cautious, “the strategy is working.”VaccinationThe vaccination portal will now open for everyone over 40 next week, he confirmed.“By every measure, the Irish people trust the vaccines. In fact, our country enjoys one of the highest levels of trust in the vaccine in the world.“Almost 100 oer cent of our citizens over the age of 70 are now fully vaccinated. This is unsurpassed in the European Union. This strategy is working.”“Now the challenge is to keep moving forward, safely, remembering all the time our determination to make sure that when we reopen each part of our society and economy, it stays open.”The Taoiseach confirmed that from the 2nd of June, hotels and guesthouses would reopen and that from June 7th, outdoor hospitality would recommence.He said from the 7th of June up to 200 people could attend outdoor events in venues with a minimum capacity of 5,000 and 100 could attend other outdoor events. Cinema and theatres can also reopen.In light of concerns around road safety, there would be a recommencement of theory tests. There will also be an incremental reopen of driver test centres.“I really want to emphasise one key point. Continued progress is not inevitable. Change brings risk. We still have a journey to go with our vaccination programme, and we are monitoring very closely what impact new variants, especially the B1617 Indian variant has under spread of the virus. But subject to us continuing to make progress, we will move to the next phase of reopening,” he said.This will mean that from July 5th indoor service will recommence in restaurants and bars.Indoor events will recommence at this time with a maximum of 100 attendees in larger venues and 50 in all others.“We will see a further increase in the numbers attending outdoor events, indoor exercise and sports activities will return and there will be further relaxation on visits to private homes, and up to 50 guests will be able to attend wedding receptions,” Mr Martin said.Furthermore, from August 5th there will be a further increase in numbers attending indoor events with 200 in larger venues and 100 in all others.The 50 per cent capacity restriction on public transport will be lifted and up to 100 guests will be able to attend weddings.“Our direction of travel is clear, and it’s very positive. To continue in this direction, it is important that we all adhere to public health guidelines and make sensible personal decisions.”On international travel, Mr Martin said: “I understand the pent-up desire of very many people to have a break overseas or to welcome friends and family from abroad. But I also understand very clearly the need to get this right and to make sure that we restore international travel in a safe and sustainable way.“At my most recent meeting with European leaders last week, we confirmed our support for the European Union digital Covid-19 certificate for travel within the European Union. Today at Government we agreed to fully operate that scheme from the 19th of July. This will facilitate a return to international travel in accordance with clear safety protocols.”Sports and music eventsEarlier, it was also announced that from the 5th of July, up to three households can gather together with another household regardless of vaccination status.Indoor dining is also set to resume on July 5th. International travel is set to resume on July 19th when the Government adopts the European Union travel cert.This will allow passengers to travel throughout the EU without facing mandatory hotel quarantine on their return.It is also understood that the Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly told Cabinet that the Government is to revise its vaccination target downwards. It had been expected that 82 per cent of adults would be given at least one vaccine by the end of June. This will now be revised to the mid-70 per cent range, it is understood.Throughout June and July, test matches and concerts will be held around the country.The Cabinet also agreed to allow fans to attend a number of sports fixtures and music events throughout the summer. These are understood to include the Leinster v Dragons rugby game at the RDS on June 11th.Fans also may attend another game, Shamrock Rovers v Finn Harps, on the same day, as well as the Cork City v Cabinteely match. The Liberty Insurance Camogie League final at Croke Park on June 20th may also have fans in the stadium.Spectators could also be present at the Irish Life Health National Senior Championships on June 26th and at the Shamrock Rovers vs Drogheda match on June 25th . Spectators may also attend racing at the Curragh.The Government’s plan for outdoor gigs is as follows: an outdoor musical festival in the Phoenix Park on the 26th of June, fully seated with 3,500 in attendance. An outdoor music event on the 10th of June in the Iveagh Gardens curated by the National Concert Hall with 500 people in attendance. Outside of Dublin there two more music events planned one on the 26th June at the INEC Club in Killarney which will be a music performance that will be fully seated with 200 people.From June 7th, a maximum of 100 people can attend matches rising to 200 at venues that can accommodate 5,000 or more.This will rise from July 5th, to 200 at matches or 500 where there is a capacity of 5,000 or more.From August, up to 500 spectators can attend matches, or in larger venues 5000 or 25 per cent of capacity, whichever is smaller.Mr Donnelly said the Cabinet was looking “very carefully” at how to facilitate travel between Ireland and Britain.UK, US approachMinister for Transport Eamon Ryan said although there will be different regimes for travel from the US and UK to the EU digital green pass system, the “same broad approach will apply”.Mr Ryan said that non-essential travel will reopen from the US and the UK when flights to EU States begin to reopen in mid-July.Mr Ryan said that both countries would become designated third countries and said the UK was a “very close and important neighbour to us”.The Minister was speaking at a press conference in Government Buildings on the Cabinet’s decision to reopen society during the course of the summer.He said concerns had been expressed in Britain in relation to the variants of concern (the Indian variant) that are the dominant strain there.“We will require people arriving from Great Britain to self-quarantine at home unless they have been fully vaccinated. We will keep this under review and I hope, later in the Summer, we will be able to open up further the common travel area we have the privilege of sharing with the UK.”He said mandatory hotel quarantine would be retained for what he said would be a very small number of countries. Mr Ryan also confirmed that children travelling abroad with parents would require a PCR test in order to get a digital certificate“It will only be used in relation to variants of concern,” he said.Working from homeTánaiste Leo Varadkar said that the national economy recovery plan announced next week, including €900 million in EU funding, would help to “make sure as many businesses as possible survive the period ahead.”He said that in relation to some business in the event sector, including nightclubs, he understood they would be disappointed they have not yet been allowed to reopen. “They will not be forgotten,” he said.He said that 25,000 people have left the Pandemic Unemployment Payments in the past week and people were going back to work in big numbers. He said any withdrawal of PUP would be gradual.Responding to a question from The , the Taoiseach confirmed that the public health advice for people to work from home had not changed.“The public health advice is strongly of the view that people work from home where it is possible. That advice is as strong as ever.”Turning to the vaccination programme, the three Government leaders emphasised the high volume of vaccinations, which were continuing at a rate of 300,000 per week.Mr Varadkar said that 2.5 million people will be fully vaccinated by the end of July, according to the projections of the High Level Task Force on Covid-19 Vaccination.On restaurants, he said he understood where the Restaurant Association was coming from with its challenge but the rationale of the Government had always been a phased reopening. That approach, he said, meant that it was outdoor dining first, and then indoor dining.“They point out the anomaly that hotels are allowed to serve residents in dining rooms but that has always been the case even under level 5. We have never made people eat their meals in their bedrooms.”He said that restaurants and bars, even though open for outdoor dining throughout June, would still get paid the weekly Covid Restrictions Support Scheme payment (worth up to €5,000 per week) as if they were closed.“Then there will be a bullet payment in July,” he said, adding that hotels would not get those payments.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"fans may attend football rugby games and horse racing in summer","story":"The Cabinet is this afternoon considering allowing fans to attend a number of sports fixtures throughout the summer.These are understood to include the Leinster v Dragons rugby game at the RDS on June 11th.

Since then – and this comes as a surprise to nobody – the Government has cleaved very closely to public health advice.But now, reopening is happening at a scale and a pace that would have been considered unlikely even up until a few weeks ago. It’s not that things are quite returning to the status quo ante. Still by mid-July there will be outdoor gigs, spectators at sporting events, indoor dining and drinking, and even the return of international travel.However, this change is as much Nphet-led as it is politician-led.“On this occasion and the last Nphet have surprised on the upside,” said a senior Minister, who did not wish to be named.“The views of Nphet and us Ministers have not erged. We have obviously put a bit of flesh on the bones, with the pilot events for example, but there have been no exceptions.”Members of the Cabinet have expressed surprise at what they say is a step-change in approach from Nphet. They had expected headwinds, in particular, to the plans to reopen indoor dining and drinking in pubs and restaurants in early July.“It’s not without risk,” said the Minister. “There’s a degree of nervousness about all of that, especially the impact (consumption of alcohol) indoors will have on case numbers.“Nphet had no objection to the reopening yet remained much more conservative in their approach to outdoor events and activities. We were all a little puzzled by that.”Most of the change of approach can be ascribed to the success of the vaccine programme so far. Cabinet ministers say they are conscious that the slowdown in the programme (due to shortfalls in promised supplies of Janssen and AstraZeneca vaccines) in addition to the arrival of the highly transmissible Indian variant will have an upward impact on numbers.However, another Cabinet Minister said there was confidence that the decoupling between case numbers on the one hand, and serious illness and death, would continue. “The new cases will be unvaccinated people, in other words the young,” said the Minister. “They tend not to get very ill.”The decision on international travel was dealt with as a separate strand, and, unusually, did not involve Nphet, although it is certain that Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan delivered advice to Ministers.Among Cabinet members there were mixed views? “It will help in the sense that it will steady the ship,” said one Minister. “I’m not sure that there will be a bounce in popularity in the medium term. Eaten bread is soon forgotten. The Opposition can flip from being zero-Covid to demanding the immediate reopening of society and will then start zeroing in on the housing crisis.“The most it will do is steady the ship and steady the nerves.

Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said on Friday morning that Europe would be introducing the travel scheme from July 1st and would allow around six weeks for members states to introduce the travel cert. The digital green cert will allow people to travel if they are fully vaccinated, have a negative PCR test or can show they have recently recovered from Covid-19.The US, France, Belgium and Luxembourg will be taken off the list for mandatory hotel quarantine, leaving just Turkey on the State’s European red list. Mandatory hotel quarantine is expected to continue beyond July 19th for those travelling from designated red list zones who are not fully vaccinated or do not have a negative PCR test.However Leo Vardkar Ireland is “not in a position to restore the Common Travel Area yet” due to “real concerns” about the spread of the Indian variant of the Covid-19 virus in Britain.Large gatheringsAlso from July, the numbers permitted at outdoor organised events are expected to increase to a maximum of 100 attendees at the majority of venues.

These are understood to include the Leinster v Dragons rugby game at the RDS on June 11th . Fans also may attend another game, Shamrock Rovers v Finn Harps, on the same day, as well as the Cork City v Cabinteely match. Fans may also attend racing at the Curragh.From June 7th a maximum of 100 people can attend matches rising to 200 at venues that can accommodate 5,000 or more.This will rise from July 5th, to 200 at matches or 500 where there is a capacity of 5,000 or more.From August, up to 500 spectators can attend matches, or in larger venues 5000 or 25 per cent of capacity, whichever is smaller.The number of guests at a wedding reception will rise to 50 people indoors in July, which will then increase to 100 in August, under the Nphet recommendations.The Government’s plan for outdoor gigs is as follows: an outdoor musical festival in the Phoenix Park on June 26th, fully seated with 3,500 in attendance. An outdoor music event on the 10th of June in the Iveagh Gardens curated by the National Concert Hall with 500 people in attendance. Outside of Dublin there two more music events planned one on the 26th June at the INEC Club in Killarney which will be a music performance that will be fully seated with 200 people.On a smaller scale, from the 5th of July, up to three households can gather together with another household regardless of vaccination status.Vaccine shortfallGovernment Ministers are expected to press ahead with the reopening plans recommended by Nphet despite the significant shortfalls in the supply of vaccines, including potentially a big reduction in the expected numbers of the single-dose Johnson \u0026amp Johnson shot.HSE chief executive Paul Reid said the best-case scenario for deliveries of AstraZeneca in the coming weeks is half of what was expected, while the HSE does not know how many Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccines it will receive. Mr Reid said the number varies from a worst case of 64,000 to a best case of 235,000. So far, 60,000 doses have been received, most of which have been administered.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: UK Covid cases surpass 4,000 a day for first time since April 1Bitcoin \u0026#39mine\u0026#39 raided by police after bypassing the grid to steal electricityUS soldiers \u0026#39revealed locations of nuclear weapons in Europe by posting details on online flashcards,\u0026#39 report claimsComment: The rudest word in Greek is no laughing matterExclusive: Britain’s X Files – Government’s UFO hunters may restart their search for alien lifePrince Harry learned of Prince Philip\u0026#39s death when police were sent to his California homeCruella De Vil becomes the latest victim of Hollywood\u0026#39s smoking banBoris Johnson unaware Tory donor paid part of flat refurbishment bill, report findsNicola Sturgeon is facing a backlash for keeping Glasgow under Level 3 Covid restrictionsGreece and Spain agree to trial vaccine passports Majority yet to meet family or friends indoors despite lockdown easingFriday evening UK news briefing: Covid data that puts June 21 in doubtWho is next on the list for Covid vaccines - and how will I be invited to book an appointment?Covid lockdown roadmap: the latest rules and news on June 21 reopeningSurgery backlog will lead to \u0026#396,400 excess deaths by the end of next year\u0026#39Matt Hancock committed ‘minor’ breach of ministerial code over family firm given NHS contractComment: Reckless Hancock left care homes to fend for themselvesBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"freedom day hangs balance power vaccines brings hope","story":"Prof John Edmunds, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), had been still more pessimistic, saying the prospect of opening up looks a little bit risky.Across the country, 60 per cent of cases – and 69 per cent of those ending up in accident and emergency departments – were unvaccinated.

The combined impact of Covid-19 and young people’s decisions to move to big cities have left cats like Mao Mao in high demand.In recent years, China has witnessed a rise in pet influencers that earn money through advertisements promoting pet supplies through social media. Some felines have as many as half a million followers on Weibo, China\u0027s Twitter, while over a million Chinese people tune in to pet-related livestreams every day.But as Zheng Zhi, Mao Mao\u0027s owner, explains that his cat works on a more traditional business model. Aside from working as a car model, Mao Mao can also model for jewellery brands.Mr Zheng, through Mao Mao, earns more than an average human model in China. “A car model earns 800-1500 yuan (£80-150) modelling one day, but Mao Mao is paid 2,000 yuan (£200) for half a day,” Zheng said. For brand partnerships, Mao Mao is typically offered 5,000 to 15,000 yuan to attend an event, in addition to one social media post.A typical day will involve dressing up and sitting on top of or inside a car at a mall or showroom. Crowds regularly surround Mao Mao, a descendant of cat beauty pageant winners, taking pictures and stroking his fur.At a recent auto show at a Chinese mall, Mr Zheng said two other human female models were dressed in cat-themed cheongsams. “When I placed Mao Mao in the car on display, he was three times more popular than those two beautiful car models,” he said.For Mao Mao’s first two car shows, Zheng took it upon himself to plan, manage lighting, and photography for his cat. But as Mao Mao’s popularity grew, so did his income – now, the cat has a whole team dedicated to presentation. Zheng has even hired an assistant to cater to Mao Mao’s needs.Mao Mao has booked three shows in the past month, however since The  spoke to Zhang, the cat has secured more than ten more shows. But despite his high commercial value, Mao Mao has 6350 followers at Douyin, a Chinese version of Tiktok.China has long cherished cats, which have been the focus of annual worship in previous dynasties and were kept as pets of the aristocracy as symbols of good luck, depending on the colour of the fur.But China’s growing economy in recent years has also led to an enormous growth in the number of pet owners. According to a 2020 Pets Industry Report, the number of pet owners in China have increased from 73.15 million in 2017 to 99.15 million in 2019. The pet market has exceeded 200 billion yuan, and by 2022, China will have over 300 million cats and dogs, as predicted by Euromonitor International.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"split woke explains everything political divide","story":"Invoking the word woke has the same power as using the magic Marmite word Meghan Markle, or indeed “racism” - once uttered, the Britons before you part much like the Red Sea before Moses: either spewing that “we should be ever-woke to the racism that stalks our every step”, or mourning that the “the woke put everything down to racism these days!”. Unsurprising, then, that a poll of Britons this week found that as many think “woke” is a compliment (26 per cent) as think it’s an insult (24 per cent). The finding will, however, shock many on the Left, who had coined the word woke to indicate being “right-on”, aware of all that is wrong in this bad, bad world, its myriad injustices, racial and otherwise - and in the case of my friends in their twenties, assumed its definition had remained as such, untouched through the ages. Hence their despair at those who are anti-woke - how can you be opposed to something so uncontroversial as awareness? Yet everyone I know over thirty, particularly my parents’ generation - thought everyone knew woke indicated being pedantic to the point of foolishness and thus are somewhat puzzled by those who proudly badge themselves as woke. Of course, this misunderstanding over “woke” creates perfect fodder for those who do understand to whip up resentment and stoke the political polarisation self-proclaimed Marxists can point at centrist dads expressing reservations around wokeness (“wokeness is anti-racism, therefore they are pro-racism!”), while Laurence Fox can straw-man sneer at the pomposity of those proud to be “woke”. The algorithms reinforce the ide by leeching off the extremity of statements about wokeness, propelled by likes and hates which are, bizarrely, hinge on two entirely different understandings of their meaning. That the political ide we are currently experiencing falls neatly along the lines of the woke ide is striking the proportion of Tories and Brexiteers who consider woke a compliment is 12 and 13 per cent - while 36 and 37 per cent of Labour supporters and Remainers consider it a compliment.It is no wonder, therefore, that the report described “culture wars” as a “top-down, elite-driven phenomenon”: The war over woke is just a microcosm of a wider ide in understanding, which everyone from Trump to Ash Sarkar uses to ruffle and rouse the troops in all matters identity politics.The Left view racism as structural, baked-in - which is why statues and micro-aggressions and National Trust slavery links - which feel silly and sanctimonious to many Tories - are fundamental to the fight for equality.   All of what is ostensibly just swirly Bachelor-of-Arts bunkum - language, history - has real and important consequences for our everyday. It\u0027s like when we realised about twenty years ago that saying women should be able to do what men can do wasn\u0027t really enough - we all - women included - might have subtle, sexist expectations which we had to actively think about.But at its extremes,  wokeness can mean expecting everyone to be virgin-on-wedding-night pure on 21st century issues - even if they were born a good 500 years ago. And so, cancel culture can result in a Reductio ad Hitlerum - believing any oppression experienced is comparable to that of the Holocaust — and therefore that you can label your opponent a Nazi (although, ironically, in the case of Israel, anti-Semitism is often given a free pass) - not quite the original, noble aims of wokeness. Many on the Left believe the Right do not see racism as a “very bad thing”, because, as the rallying call goes “it is not enough to be non-racist, we must be anti-racist”. And it turns out being “anti-racist requires quite a few actions.And this is precisely what has befuddled many Tory voters - those Hartlepoolians, for example. It’s not that - as much of Leftie analysis would have you believe - that they don’t care about refugees or Palestinians. It’s more that they believe in being decent to your neighbours first and foremost - after all, they happen to know Jill from over the road a bit better than anyone in the Middle East - just the way people do more for their kids than other people’s kids. Nothing against black lives matter, more unease with Black Lives Matter (caps) and defunding police officers.A sense that a media luvvie of colour railing against “white privilege” feels a bit dubious when you’re a white working-class cleaner, conversations about “intersectionality” and “cisgender” feel a bit scholastic, removed - and discourse about permafrost thawing in 2050 feels a bit indulgent when your kitchen is flooded right now.  Conservatives tend to think, to the surprise of many, that racism is very much a bad thing. But they think there are other problems too - and doesn’t taking the knee, going on about black vs white, just feel a bit like the opposite of what we were meant to be doing moving away from the idea of skin colour mattering one jot?But to admit that we are speaking a different language - whether on wokery or racism would not serve the social media stars well - the followers mustn’t be allowed to translate! After all, it wouldn’t do their ratings any good to try to resolve a problem through any sort of dialogue or common ground - better to cheapen the opposing argument, and score political points. Who cares about keeping a rally up, or the thousands in the stands getting anything out of the game - when you can smash something over the net - and when your opponent gets to serve, get the ball thwacked straight back in your face?More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"carrie symonds wanted pm send","story":":root Carrie Symonds wanted PM to send -word complaint to the Times in row about her dogWhile Covid flooded across Britain, the PMs fiancee was furious at a total cr*p story that had claimed the couple could reshuffle their pet Dilyn out of Downing StreetCarrie Symonds wanted PM to send -word complaint to the Times in row about her dogWhile Covid flooded across Britain, the PMs fiancee was furious at a total cr*p story that had claimed the couple could reshuffle their pet Dilyn out of Downing StreetPrime Minister Boris Johnsons partner Carrie Symonds holds their pet dog DilynImage: PAByLizzy BuchanPolitical Correspondent:,  May Updated:,  May Boris Johnson is claimed to have blocked a complaint from his fiancee Carrie Symonds over negative reports about their dog Dilyn.

Wrexham-based Topwood Ltd was given a place on the Shared Business Services framework as a potential supplier for local NHS trusts in February , seven months after Mr Hancock became Health Secretary. Mr Hancock then faced questions last month when it emerged he had a % stake in the shredding firm - which owned and run by his sister and brother-in-law. Lord Geidt, the independent adviser on the ministersapos interests, today ruled Mr Hancock acted properly and honestly in promptly declaring his % stake, which was a new financial interest. But the watchdog also said Mr Hancock should have declared his link to the firm when it won the NHS framework contract in  - which he did not do, because he wasnapost aware it had happened. Lord Geidt today noted that Mr Hancockaposs sister and brother-in-law would have been well aware that he was the UK Health Secretary.  Either the Secretary of State’s sister and or brother-in-law failed to raise this award with Mr Hancock, or nothing had otherwise been brought to Mr Hancock’s attention such that he would have had reason to enquire, the watchdog wrote. He added: I believe there to be a danger that a reasonable person might perceive this link to represent a conflict of interest, and that it should have been declared at the time. In reaching this determination, I accept that the scale of NHS operations in Englandare broad and that the activity of NHS SBS may have been very far from the Secretary of State’s main focus. I assess this earlier failure to declare the interest was as a result of his lack of knowledge and in no way deliberate, and therefore, in technical terms, a minor breach of the Ministerial Code. The report added: I recognise that Mr Hancock has acted with integrity throughout and that this event should in no way impugn his good character or ministerial record. A Whitehall source previously said that the Health Secretary has no active participation in running Topwood Limited and that neither he nor the Department of Health and Social Carewere involved in awarding the contracts. The source said that Mr Hancock had discussed with the departmentaposs top civil servant, the Permanent Secretary, that he was to be gted the shares in the firm before accepting them. Mr Hancock has no responsibility for NHS Wales, which reportedly awarded the firm £, worth of contracts, as health is a devolved matter and so dealt with by the Welsh Government.The story emerged following accusations of cronyism within Government by Labour.Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth said today: As usual Matt Hancock dismissed and evaded questions when asked about this in the Commons. There is a rotten culture set from very top across this government. A spokesman for the Health Secretary said: The Health Secretary thanks Lord Geidt for his work. He is glad that the shareholding in question is found to have been declared diligently and that Lord Geidt assesses him to have acted properly and honestly. He agrees that any perceived breach could only be technical in nature and accepts his advice.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNHSMatthew Hancock MP"},{"url":null,"title":"vaccine success not make up","story":"NewsopinionThe vaccine success does not make up for deadly Tory mistakes - whatever Matt Hancock tells youFleet Street Fox delivers some truth bombs on who we really have to thank for the state were inmirrorShareCommentsByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  MAY Newsopinion\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

While boasting of the jab rollout in Parliament, he declared magnanimously: I am proud of everyone in my department. What a nice guy, sharing the honours like that. In descending order of importance he went on to applaud all those working in health care and public health, the armed forces who fought on this home front, the volunteers, who stood in cold car parks with a smile, colleagues across the House who have done their bit, and most of all the British people.The fact he led the fight to do all that, while keeping care home residents safe and being absolutely and completely straight with everyone, makes this one manaposs personal achievements all the more worthy of headlines. We shall overcome! he almost sang.So shall we check what really happened  Britainaposs vaccine was designed by Professor Sarah Gilbert of Oxford University, who told colleagues on January , , she could repurpose one she had already developed for Ebola and MERS. They gave her £m to keep going. The same day, the first Brit died from coronavirus. The next day, the Mirror splashed on aposKILLER FLUapos and  Brits whoaposd flown from China forced to isolate in a RAF base. Boris Johnson had just ed from a £, holiday in Mustique with a pregnant Carrie Symonds, where they had become secretly engaged.As Gilbert and her team worked, Boris Johnson missed five COBRA meetings about the growing epidemic, allegedly to write a book about Shakespeare for which heaposd been paid years earlier, and without which he could not afford to orce his we for the sake of his new fiancee, their baby, and avoidance of a scandal. But in his absence, those meetings were chaired by Hancock. And nothing was done. No alarms sounded, no pandemic plan was prepared, no PPE sourced, no advice sought from other nations already battling the virus. Then on February  Public Health England - of which Hancock is the ultimate boss - said there was no reason to lockdown care homes.On March , the World Health Organisation declared a pandemic. Liverpool played Atletico Madrid in front of , fans. Dominic Cummings texted the PM in a panic about mass deaths. Hancock announced he was expanding testing from , a day to ,, but declined to give details. A day later, the PM said there were so few tests theyaposd be restricted to those in hospitals. On March , the same day that Donald Trump wanted UK help to bomb Iraq and Carrie was raging about a shaggy dog story, Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill repeated the official advice to him from the Department of Health, and told the PM to tell the country they should hold aposchicken pox partiesapos so everyone could catch the new disease. On March , Chief Scientist Patrick Vallance told the nation the official plan was to build up some degree of herd immunity whilst protecting the most vulnerable. Johnson said: Many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time. And care homes were told merely that visitors should wash their hands.The same day, Cummings wrote on a whiteboard: Who do we not save  He said former deputy Cabinet Secretary Helen McNamara told him: I think we are absolutely f****d. I think this country is heading for a disaster, I think we are going to kill thousands of people. On March , Imperial College London published a model that predicted , deaths without lockdowns. On March , NHS hospitals were told to urgently discharge all patients they could, including those needing social care, to free up , beds.There was no requirement to test them first.  In the days that followed, Hancock said everyone over  would have to stay indoors for four months said he was buying thousands more ventilators and was told that was stupid, without enough staff to use them. He called for an army of , covid volunteers, who when they signed up found there was nothing much for them to do. Shortly after the first lockdown was announced on March , government demands led to the collapse of a deal between Prof Gilbertaposs vaccine team and pharmaceutical company Merck.On March , Hancock and Johnson tested positive for coronavirus and locked themselves away. Two days later the Mirror reported the first NHS medic had died of coronavirus, and footage emerged of doctors and nurses working without adequate PPE.The same day, Hancock got a cheery Whats App message from friend and former pub landlord, Alex Bourne, whose technically insolvent company wound up with a £m PPE contract. On April  it was revealed that only .% of NHS staff had been tested, and a day later the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care urged care homes - which had by this point had , untested hospital patients dumped in them - to allow only essential visits.A few days later Hancock insisted the PM was hale and hearty, and shortly afterwards the PM was fighting for his le with the help of a New Zealand nurse yet to be disgusted at the second wave and a % pay rise. When he got out, he realised Hancock had not been testing in the way heaposd promised. He didnapost fire him. A few weeks later, the entire country was told lockdown was optional when he refused to fire Cummings for a highly-infectious dash to Durham and day trip to Barnard Castle. It was not until April  that the governmentaposs demands were met by Astra Zeneca, and a contract was finally signed to make the vaccine. On May , Kate Bingham was appointed head of the vaccine taskforce, with one already in the bag. It greased the supply chain, procured other vaccines, and organised logistics.  In July, Johnson refused to impose border controls. Bingham revealed a vaccine was on the way. In August Rishi Sunak told people to Eat Out To Help Out, and seeded the disease anew. In September, the PM told everyone to go back to work, school, and university, which turned into a super-spreader event for teenagers. A month later, multiple people report hearing the PM say: No more f***ing lockdowns... let the bodies pile high in their thousands!The High Court subsequently found that, by October, Hancock had unlawfully failed to publish details of % of covid contracts on time.When the first vaccines were approved, Hancock said it was due to Brexit. Experts said it was actually due to the UKaposs own medial regulators, which had always been quicker than those of the EU.  The vaccine is a brilliant, le-saving, pandemic-ending thing. But itaposs not due to the government, or peculiarly Tory policies, in any way, shape or form. The vaccine was due to vaccinologists. The delivery to arms was due to the NHS. The money that the government finally threw at it was due to panic, not vision. And evenyou think the governmentaposs vaccine efforts are the best thing ever, then you might like to know what Matt Hancock is not shouting about quite as loudly. Firstly, the vaccine task force was supervised by Business Secretary Alok Sharma from its creation in May  until November , when Nadhim Zahawi was made Vaccines Minister. By the time it was put under Hancockaposs official control on March  this year, .m people had a first dose - all without a jot of help from him.Secondly, while the vaccine will no doubt save millions of lives worldwide over time, it has so far saved , in the UK. Compare that to , lost in care homes that were shielded only from notice last March, and a further , who died in hospitals where infection control was a victim of a decade of funding cuts by successive Tory governments.All those working in health care and public health, the armed forces who fought on this home front, the volunteers who stood in cold car parks with a smile, the MPs who aposdid their bitapos, and most of all the British people, have done bloody well, considering Matt Hancock was in charge. But we shall overcome.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCabinetConservative PartyAstraZeneca plcNHSWorld Health OrganisationOxford UniversityDepartment of HealthBoris JohnsonHospitalsCare homesNursing homesPoliticsCoronavirusMatthew Hancock MP"},{"url":null,"title":"wales mark drakeford talks covid","story":"NewsWales Mark Drakeford talks Covid, Basic Income - and a warning for Keir StarmerEXCLUSIVE: The -year-old First Minister was a surprise victor in Mays local elections.

Stressing “itaposs not for me to offer lessons to anybody ”, Mr Drakeford cited reasons for the Welsh partyaposs success. “Weaposre very proud to be Welsh but we are very proud to be Labour,” he said. “Weaposre not half-hearted Labour, weaposre not shamefaced Labour, Labour that quite wishes we were trying to look a little bit like something . “We are authentically Labour, we make an offer that is true to the values, traditions, histories of the Labour Party in Wales.”  Signalling that Mr Starmer is not yet doing that for the UK-wide party, Mr Drakeford went on: “I think that is what he will want to do, now that he will have more of an opportunity the other side of the pandemic to be able to set out that alternative view of what the United Kingdom could look likeit had a Labour government in charge. “I think it has been much more dficult for him to do that because with every news cycle dominated by the pandemic and with him, I think quite rightly, wanting to show that a responsible opposition supports the Government where necessary in a national crisis, itaposs much harder for you to set out that distinctive, authentic Labour offer. “Now I think he will have the chance.” Labour voters in North Wales who switched to the Tories in December  were waiting to be won back for the Senedd ballot, said Mr Drakeford. “We did some early focus groups with people who were once Labour voters but voted Conservative in ,” he said. “The question we were asking them was, aposHave they made a le-changing decision or were they open to the idea that they would come back to vote Labour apos  “Right from the very beginning the message we had from them was they hadnapost crossed the rubicon never to come back – they had leant their votes to the Tories for very particular reasons. “They regarded those reasons as over and they were prepared to come back to Labour – but we needed to convince them to come back to Labour. “They werenapost going to come back of their own accord, they still needed to know that what we had to offer would be what they would think was important to them.” Mr Drakeford, a long-term ally of Mr Corbyn, did not initially identy the ex-leader as a factor.Instead, he said voters claimed to be driven by Brexit and “credibility”.He said: “Lots of things that Labour were offering in  were things they liked. “They didnapost credibly believe we could deliver them so there was a lack of confidence in not the ideas themselves but that the party could genuinely make those things happen.”  Pressed on whether Mr Corbyn was an issue, he admitted: “I donapost want to say Jeremy wasnapost a part of that credibility gap. “But nor do I think that it is fair to just put it at the door of one person.” Askedthe Westminster-based party had been doing just that, he said: “I think itaposs understandable that the new leader wants to put his own stamp on things and to an extent that does mean needing to make a bit of a departure from the previous leadership. “I donapost want to sound critical of Keir Starmer for doing that, I think itaposs a natural thing for him to do. “But I think there are wider lessons than just inidualising the reasons why they had such a hard time in . “Labour had a very good time in  with the same leader. “Itaposs too simplistic to say it was Corbyn and Brexit. “It was definitely Brexit and … I rather sum it up in the broader term of people not having confidence that Labour was a party that was capable of translating what we were offering into proper governmental action.” Mild-mannered academic is now a household name Mark Drakeford found it “very odd” when he tuned into a BBC radio comedy and heard an impression of himself. “Very odd indeed,” he admitted.“I was heading up to North Wales and we were listening to Dead Ringers in the car and, there you are – suddenly being part of the programme.“It illustrates in a way that not only in Wales has the devolved nature of the United Kingdom become more apparent, but it has become much apparent across the whole of the United Kingdom.”  While funny, the episode also drove home to -year-old Mr Drakeford the fact he was now a household name – a quiet, softly-spoken academic now leading a nation of more than three million people in the gravest crisis since the Second World War. The pandemic and regular press conferences have propelled him to a profile higher than any of his three predecessors enjoyed. Admitting he is recognised in the supermarket, he said: “You cannot be incognito in Wales anymore.” He hails aposdecisiveapos result against independence For many people, the Welsh Governmentaposs distinct response to the pandemic – and dfering rules from England – marked the first practical demonstration of devolution since it was triggered in . And for some – not only nationalists – it has fuelled the case for Welsh independence. Support for separatism has grown and in November it hit % – its highest ever. Yet at this monthaposs election, Plaid Cymru again came third behind the Conservatives, gaining just one seat – taking the nationalistsapos representation to  in the -seat Senedd. Acknowledging the coronavirus crisis has thrown independence into the spotlight, Mr Drakeford said: “There is no doubt that the experience of the last  months has led people in Wales to ask that question more than ever before.“But the results of the election I think are really pretty decisive. People had a choice between a party that wanted to abolish the Assembly and hand Wales back to Westminster – and they didnapost win a single seat. “And you had a party that, much more than previously, made independence the front and centre of their campaign – and they lost ground. “Whereas the Labour Partyaposs message of a strong Wales in a United Kingdom still represents where people in Wales want to be.” First Minister tries to explain death rate in Wales Walesapos vaccination programme is the UKaposs most successful for first doses and Mr Drakeford hails it as a success story. But its death rate is the worst. Latest figures show it has . deaths per , people compared with . in England and . for the UK. Mr Drakeford said: “Too many people died in Wales, too many people died across the United Kingdom. “Amongst the reasons why parts of Wales were particularly badly affected are the ones which explain so much of health inequalities. “This was a virus that sought out vulnerable people – and Wales has an older, poorer, sicker population than any other part of the United Kingdom.” He also points to how Covid- targeted those who “lived in densely populated, urban areas – Valley communities in Wales are small houses on narrow streets, often with dferent generations of the same family living close by one another”. Mr Drakeford feared “a lot of these things are fairly intractable, youaposre certainly not going to put those things right in an easy way”. Universal Basic Income pilot could start next year Wales will become the first part of the UK to test a Universal Basic Income. In its pure form, the welfare scheme sees everyone given a set amount of cash regardless of whether they are homeless, penniless and unemployed or a yacht-owning, mansion-dwelling billionaire. Supporters say the system helps create a level playing field for the hardest up in society. Critics say it offers a disincentive to work and gives the rich extra money. Wales will pilot a scheme, probably starting next year and only involving care leavers. Fewer than , are expected to be involved.  How much they will be given is under debate, but Mark Drakeford believes the experiment could be groundbreaking. “It will be a modest pilot because our powers and our finances will only allow us to do that,” said the First Minister. “I am very keen that we make the attempt we can. “We think we will do it with care leavers because itaposs a population that we know about. “We know itaposs a population of young people that, as they leave the care of local authorities, often struggle to make their way in the world, not having enough money to do the things other young people take for granted.” Mr Drakeford, whose PhD looked at UBI, wants to see “whether the promises that are made by its advocates are actually realised in the lives of those young people”. He added: “I am sympathetic to it. “What we have never seen though is whether the advantages on paper, which can often be convincing, actually happen in the lives of people when you get to basic income. “I think it is definitely interesting enough for us to try to have a pilot in Wales – learn from doing this in a practical, applied way rather than the slightly theoretical debate thereaposs been about it.”FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPoliticsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"binge eaters incredible transformation sheds","story":"NewsBinge eaters incredible transformation as she sheds st after therapist uncovers triggersKrissy Gennaro had struggled with her weight for years after getting stuck in binge eating spirals, but after having gastric sleeve surgery shes transformed her lemirrorShareCommentsByJessica Taylor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Krissy Gennaro, , has lost a whopping st lbs and is still going after having the surgery  months ago. “I was fairly slim until my early s,” Krissy, from New York, told The Mirror. “I was in the military and I slowly started packing on weight while I was struggling with depression.” Krissy’s weight gain caused her to quit her job with the US coastguard. In the years that followed, she fell pregnant and gave birth to her daughter, Brooke. But she continued to pile on the pounds and reached her heaviest weight shortly after Brooke was born. “I’d gain weight and then lose it. But I’d only get as far as losing lbs before something triggered the binge eating, and then I’d put it straight back on,” Krissy explained.  Krissy described binge eating as “filling a void” that she couldn’t control. When something triggered her, she’d seek comfort in sweets, cake and pizza. “I know when it’s coming, It’s like a can of Pringles - once you pop, you can’t stop. I’d just spiral. “When it happens, I know I shouldn’t be doing it, but I can’t stop thinking about it,” she explained. After several attempts to sht the weight herself failed, Krissy made the dficult decision to have gastric sleeve surgery. “It finally got to the point where I couldn’t do it anymore. I’d miss out on things. I’m a fun person and I like to go on adventures,” she said, recalling a red-faced moment from when she took Brooke to a carnival. “I remember asking the guy on the rideI’d be able to fit into the seat.” So after researching the procedure and meeting with consultants, Krissy told her family about her decision.“I showed Brooke some videos on Instagram from other people who had had the operation. I explained everything so well,” she said.Now with her new partner Joe after splitting up with Brooke’s dad, Krissy explained the process to him and his daughter Bella, , too. “I had to meet with a psychiatrist to make sure I was in the right frame of mind to have the operation,” she said. “Then two weeks before the operation I was on a pre-liquid diet. I was mainly drinking protein shakes and eating yoghurt and jelly.” Before long, Krissy’s operation date came around and she went under the kne to have part of her stomach removed. “I was so miserable when I woke up because of the anaesthetic,” Krissy laughed. “But when it wore off I felt much better.” She was kept in for observation for a few days before being sent home. Unlike some patients who undergo gastric sleeve surgery, Krissy was encouraged to start eating whole food again just two days after the op. “I had things like chicken broth and found some recipes for really soft food on Instagram, like lasagne without the pasta,” she said. Whereas Krissy could eat huge volumes of food before the operation, now she was only eating a few bites before feeling full. But she knew the operation wasn’t enough - and she began to make lestyle changes too. She said: “I started walking rather than driving to places, even just to go to the shops. I also took the stairs rather than the escalator.  “If I was out on a hot day and I wanted an ice cream, I’d make sure I did some exercise first.”When Krissy worked from home due to the coronavirus pandemic, she bought a mini elliptical machine to work out during the day.“I used to get up every hour and do at least  steps to get my count up,” she said. As the weight fell off and she got fitter, Krissy started doing  steps per hour. She also started an Instagram account, @see_krissy_shrink, to document her journey. However, it wasn’t always plain sailing for Krissy, and there were times when her urges to binge crept up on her.  “I gained about lbs during the pandemic. I didn’t realise at the time that I was anxious about everything and that caused me to put on weight,” she said. Thankfully, Krissy is now working with a therapist who has helped her identy her triggers that made her fall back into bingeing and eating unhealthy foods. Now, she finds it easiest to stick to an Atkins-style diet where she tries to eat fewer carbs and more protein. “Instead of mashed potato, I’ll have mashed caullower. I also swap beef mince for turkey mince,” she said. But she thinks it’s important not to deprive herself of things she wants - as long as she’s not eating that food all the time.  “The other day Joe and I really wanted a Five Guys takeaway, so I let myself have one,” she said. Laughing, she added: “Although I could only eat a quarter of a burger and seven chips before I felt full!” Krissy credits Joe with helping her get a grip on her binge eating and obsessive nature. “He can tell when I’m going into a downward spiral and he can usually set me straight by letting me talk about it,” she said. Now, Krissy weighs st lbs and she’s still keen to lose more weight, but she’s not setting a target for herself. “If I set a specic weight, I’ll begin to obsess over it and it’s not healthy,” she said. She’s looking forward to things she couldn’t enjoy for so many years, like shopping trips with Brooke. “I feel so much better now I don’t always feel like I’m the biggest person in the room. If you sit next to me on the train, you’ll have space. “I don’t have to worry about getting on a plane and not fitting in the seat anymore. It’s such a great feeling.” Although she’s much happier in her slimmed-down frame, Krissy wants people to remember to be kind to those struggling with their weight. “When you’re overweight, no matter what, there’s judgment of some kind. Eventhey’re not thinking it in a harsh way, the judgment is there. “Just remember, it’s your le and your journey. Everything  is just someone’s opinion.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMental healthFitness"},{"url":null,"title":"couple more two decades between","story":"NewsCouple with more than two decades between them say age is a mindsetAlyssa Patmos, , and Geoff Kulesa, , say the age gap between them isnt an issue and their families have been totally accepting of their relationshipmirrorShareCommentsByJessica Taylor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsAlyssa Patmos and Geoff Kulesa are smitten after nine months of dating \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Alyssa Patmos, , and Geoff Kulesa, , met nine months ago in a park in Denver, Colorado, while Alyssa was walking to the supermarket. “We initially passed by each other but I saw [Alyssa] a bit late. I smiled at her and she smiled back,” Geoff told The Mirror. Thinking little of it, Alyssa carried on to the supermarket to pick up some food. On the way back, with shopping bags in her hands, Geoff caught her eye again. “I thought, ‘I should have talked to her’,” Geoff said. “On the way back, I saw her again and introduced myself.”  Alyssa, who had just moved to the city, was living in a temporary apartment while she had renovations done on a permanent flat. “I’d just moved to Denver so I wasn’t even thinking about dating. But Geoff came up and asked to walk with me, and I thought that took a lot of courage,” she told The Mirror. With that, Geoff carried Alyssa’s bags and they walked together. “She had a girl-next-door look but with a bit of an edge,” Geoff laughed, pointing out Alyssa’s nose ring and tattoo. The pair hit it off immediately and left the park to go for a drink. “I wanted to get into a meaningful conversation. Neither of us wanted to do small talk,” Geoff explained. After their first impromptu date was a huge success, Geoff was excited to see Alyssa again. But it wasn’t quite plain sailing. “I hoped she wanted to see me again, but she put me off for a while and said she was ‘busy’,” Geoff joked. “I was actually busy!” Alyssa insisted, explaining she was setting up a masterclass in Denver and was working long hours. But as soon as the masterclass was over, the pair finally had their second date. From then on, they saw each other all the time. Despite the  years between them, Geoff and Alyssa say they barely notice an age dference. “I don’t remember when I found out Geoff’s age but it didn’t bother me. I’d dated guys who were  years older than me before. I know  is a bigger gap but it wasn’t an issue,” Alyssa said.  Geoff agreed, adding he’d also dated younger women before. “The only time it’s ever been an issue is when we stop and think about it. My kids are closer to Alyssa’s age than I am,” he said. Geoff has a son aged  and twin boys aged  from a previous relationship - but they’re perfectly accepting of the relationship. Alyssa’s parents, too, have no issues with the age gap between them. “We didn’t feel the need to keep it from anyone because we’re both open books,” Alyssa said.  However, the couple, who have been together for nine months, have had some bumps in the road. “We don’t get funny looks in the street, because Geoff really doesnapost look his age, Alyssa said. But someone called me a ‘Sugar Baby’ once which I didn’t like at all,” Alyssa said. She added she’s received some judgmental comments about what will happen when she and Geoff get older.  “People askI’m going to take care of him when he’s older. I think people live in fear of what the future’s going to look like. “Women also don’t believe me when I say I don’t want kids. A lot of people ask, ‘Oh, is Geoff going to want kids ’ but I don’t want children and people don’t seem to believe me when I say that.” Geoff said: “In general, people who question us say, ‘Alyssa can’t possibly be on your emotional level’, but she’s an old soul and she’s incredibly mature.” But overall, the couple say most people are “pretty accepting” of their relationship and they’re still smitten with each other. They officially moved in together a month ago, but claim they were spending every night together beforehand anyway. “My new apartment was basically a storage unit,” Alyssa laughed.As coronavirus restrictions ease, the pair are looking forward to being more spontaneous in their relationship, which is going from strength to strength.Geoff said: “Age is just a mindset at the end of the day. We’re so compatible in so many ways, and I’m glad I didn’t limit myself in age. It’s hard enough to find a good match andyou set an age limit for yourself, you’re shutting off so many people.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnAge gap"},{"url":null,"title":"woman left mortified after dating","story":"NewsWoman left fuming after dating app match sends her fat-shaming messageFlorence Simpson, who promotes body positivity on TikTok, shared the exchange on Twitter, which resulted in Ben being banned from the app for his dodgy comment to the -year-oldmirrorShareCommentsByRosaleen FentonAudience Writer:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY News \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

John said that Cummingsapos testimony had proved that the Prime Minister had not taken the virus seriously. Clearly touched by the call, Mr OaposBrien said: I bet you were a brilliant dad. And John replied: She was  years old, she was a bundle of fun. I called her Little Chief and she called me Big Chief… she was just the loveliest person in the world and she didnapost deserve it. None of these people deserved it. At a time of crisis when we desperately needed a really serious politician in charge of Downing Street, we sadly finished up with a charlatan and a narcissist and a liar and thataposs why my daughter is dead. He continued: I feel for all of these families, every single family, my heart goes out to them and when I see it every day and people turn around and say itaposs only nine dead today. Thataposs somebody’s loved one - itaposs not only two, itaposs not only nine, itaposs not only one. Itaposs somebodyaposs loved one thataposs died. People are in pain and people should remember that the next time they go to put their cross in a box in a polling station, because this man isnapost fit to run the country.  Mr OaposBrien tweeted after the conversation: This call completely broke me. I will remember John – and Rosie – as long as I live. Johnaposs strong words on Thursday came as the Mirror revealed the fury of some families towards Health Secretary Matt Hancock. He was a particular target of Mr Cummings, who claimed the senior minister should have been sacked multiple times. Mr Hancock has hit back and denied the allegations made against him. The families of some care home victims are now calling for an inquiry to find out why their loved ones were like lambs to the slaughter. With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email. Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here. A daughter, whose dad was one of those who died in a care home, has won a judicial review to hold the Government to account for their deadly failings during the pandemic. But she believes both the Prime Minister and the Health Secretary should face manslaughter charges too. Dr Cathy Gardner, from Sidmouth in Devon, was reduced to tears as she watched Mr Cummings give seven hours of evidence. Her -year-old dad died from the virus on April , just a week after the first lockdown.  I will not have been the only one crying because it reminds you of the disaster, Dr Gardner said. Particulary when he was talking about not having a plan for care homes. The consequences of that for so many thousands of people was just awful. Fty per cent of the deaths early on were in care homes and that’s so wrong. Her father, Michael Gibson, is believed to have died from Covid after a patient was discharged from hospital back into his care home despite testing positive for the virus. Seven other residents also died. She said both Mr Johnson and Mr Hancock should be charged with manslaughter adding: Our loved ones were being forced to share a space with someone with Covid - it’s absolute madness.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"coal miner 69 meets teenage","story":":root Coal miner, , meets teenage climate striker to learn what they have in commonMiner Allan Holliday, , meets passionate -year-old climate campaigner Isabella Bridgman for our Britain Talks project - and the two proud West Cumbrias find plenty of common groundCoal miner, , meets teenage climate striker to learn what they have in commonMiner Allan Holliday, , meets passionate -year-old climate campaigner Isabella Bridgman for our Britain Talks project - and the two proud West Cumbrias find plenty of common groundthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video -year-old-climate-activist-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:ptiGtOu,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

She’s a teenage climate striker fighting to stop the first new deep UK coalmine in  years. Allan Holliday and Isabella Bridgman were born five decades years apart, and have very dferent views on plans to open a new coalmine in the heart of Cumbria – but could they manage to discuss their views, and even find ‘more in common’ As the UK prepares to host the United Nations Climate Summit, we asked Allan and Isabella to get together on zoom as part of our #BritainTalks project to discuss plans for the mine in Whitehaven.The issue has ided their local community and ides the country. As Allan, , says: “I don’t want my grandchildren to grow up in a place of unemployment and high deprivation just so we can have a nice area to look at.” For Isabella, , the thought of carbon emissions from a new coalmine is genuinely frightening. “If we invest in this mine it will contribute to global warming and the future will be miserable because of climate change,” she says. What do you think  Join the Britain Talks conversation in the comments below....  “I live in Cockermouth, so I have seen the floods. I don’t want my area destroyed by flooding.” Allan, who lives with we, Susan, , in a bungalow high above Whitehaven’s historic harbour, went straight from school to work in the now closed Haig pit, before becoming a postman then a local councillor. Isabella, who usually lives with her family in nearby Cockermouth, is away at college in South Wales. Yet both West Cumbrians also share a deep love for their local landscape and community, as well as being keen on a bag of chips. There has been talk of a new deep coal mine in Whitehaven for years. Cumbria County council approved plans for The West Cumbria Mining facility, off the coast of Whitehaven, in  promising to create  jobs and provide coal to the UK steel industry. But after new environmental evidence and campaigns against the mine – including fierce protests from Isabella and other climate strikers- the government is reviewing the plans.  Allan tells Isabella he’s seen first-hand how poverty has affected the area. “If we can get this coal mine up and running it will vastly change the quality of le for the people of West Cumbria,” he says. “I don’t want my neighbours and friends to continue with le of unemployment. Unless we can find jobs there is no future for them, they are starting to lose a bit of hope. That is why the coal mine came along, people in this area were clapping their hands, not because it was coal, because it was jobs, it is work.  “At present there is nobody  offering any other form of employment. They kept saying they shouldn’t be having these types of industries, we should have cleaner, environmentally-friendly jobs. But local people have been promised this for  years. The coal side is going to produce the raw materials to help us build the wind farms, to build the tidal barriers and solar .” Isabella is chatting from the closed campus where she’s been all term.  Perched on her bed, surrounded by posters and college work reminders in her student room, Isabella agrees - but thinks they should push for long-term, sustainable jobs instead. “I think the jobs argument is an important one,” she says. “I really recognise that jobs are really needed in the area. But the coal mine isn’t going to be sustainable. We have committed to going zero carbon in  so these jobs are not going to be long-term. “West Cumbria deserves better than that. I want to see the government investing in more sustainable jobs in more stable industries that are secure and well-paying.”  She adds: “It’s quite scary as a young person to see the government making decisions I know will contribute to global warming and impact my future.” Allan clearly misses the “family atmosphere” and close-knit community of his pit days. But as they talk more, Allan also explains that he understands the harsh realities of mining more than most. He tells Isabella of losing his own dad, William, who was killed working as a miner when Allan was just two years old.  William was down Haig Pit when he was hit by falling machinery, leaving Allan’s pregnant mum to raise seven children. “It was terrible,” he says, “My mum had to bring us up, but the community helped, people did what they could. That’s what it’s like here, it’s a good area.” Then Allan admits: “If there was an alternative, I’ll be honest with you, I’d rather have an alternative. Because there’s nothing easy about coalmining.” And he says he’s always supported alternative technology. “In  through my work as a councillor, I opened the first wind farm in Cumbria. I have always been a fan of wind farms.” But Allan lacks belief that any alternative jobs or technologies will make it to West Cumbria in time to save his beloved town. “I just can’t see sustainable jobs coming in the next two years,” he says. “That is too long for me to wait. I have lived here all my le, I have seen what unemployment can do.” The impact on the local environment is the subject of another lively discussion, with Isabella worried the mine workings could endanger marine le, while Allan says the site is ideal.  “The coal mine is on disused coalfield site next to a disused chemical factory. It is ideally placed for high quality coal.” Allan says he shares Isabella’s concern about local flooding. “I can go along with that, when it comes to global warming the rain falls on the fells and it floods. But when we talk about global warming… I don’t think the coal mine will affect it.” But both agree on a need for central government to do more to support the West Cumbria they love. They’re protective of their community and trade stories of walking in such a beautul part of the world – as well as Allan’s favourite chip shop. “It’s better than Whitby,” he laughs, “Next time you’re home the chips are on me!” As the conversation ends, both are quick to say how much they’ve enjoyed it. “It is nice to have an adult conversation rather than someone say, ‘you don’t care’,” Allan smiles. “It is dficult when I see my neighbours unemployed and it must be dficult for Isabella to see her neighbourhood flooded. It’s nice to talk to dferent people without falling out.”  Isabella smiles. “The conversation threw up things I hadn’t really thought of before and some interesting perspectives. I’ve really enjoyed it.” Afterwards Allan admits: “I didn’t really know what to expect from Isabella. I was worried we might not be able to get through to each other, that we wouldn’t hear each other out. But our chat was really good.

Merlin Hayward moved into a new property in Newport, Wales, with partner Laura as they were expecting a child and needed a bigger place. But after moving on March , Mr Hayward said faults with the flat kept emerging, claiming it was cold and dirty.Poor sound insulation and insecure windows were among the issues reported to letting agency RedKey Property Services, WalesOnline reports. But earlier this month they were given notice to leave the property. The letting agency says that they tried to address the familyaposs concerns and they have six months until they need to move out.Have you experienced anything of the sort  Let us know at webnews@mirror “When I walked in I knew it wasn’t in a good condition at all,” Mr Hayward claimed. “But we were extremely restricted with our budget and we had a child on the way, so I agreed to take it on.” “I found myself waking up in the middle of the night with adrenaline because the noise was that loud from the flat above,” he explained. “It’s not the tenant’s fault - the walls and ceiling should be insulated to protect against this issue. “I offered the letting agency £, of my own money to help insulate the property, but it became very clear there was no room for negotiation.  “We then found a mouse hole in the bathroom which was blocked up with some loose wood, and I have a very small child who can’t go on the floor because it is in such a bad condition. “Rather than fixing the problem with the sound insulation, the letting agency offered we move flats again,” he said. “But that isn’t the correct solution. The reasonable thing is surely to make sure the sound insulation is right for every tenant. “It beggars belief that they weren’t willing to make any investment beyond what they absolutely had to. “Our oven didn’t work and so they had to replace it, and did so with an oven that was that big it protruded from the rest of the kitchen units.”  But RedKey insists it did all they could to help the couple before serving notice on them. A spokeswoman for RedKey said: “Mr Hayward and his partner have a tenancy at the property they rent via RedKey Property Services until September , . They have not been evicted. “We have worked hard to accommodate the demands made by Mr Hayward since he moved into his existing premises on March . This included offering him alternative accommodation that would have alleviated the noise issues he was concerned about. This offer was declined. “After failing to reach an agreement with Mr Hayward we issued the Section  notice on Friday, May . This is a notice to bring a tenancy to an end and signy that there is no extension or renewal of the tenancy. Mr Hayward has until November  to find alternative accommodation.”  According to the Government website, a Section  notice is used to evict tenants with shorthold tenancies. Previously the minimum notice period was two months but that was extended to six as a result of the pandemic. Mr Hayward said he has been told he could end up in emergency accommodation, where drug users and people suffering with substance misuse may be temporarily rehomed alongside his family. “I am scared for my son,” he added. “It’s really tough. It’s been a hugely demanding period for us emotionally. Instead of concentrating on supporting my family I’m worrying about getting us a council house. “More protection is needed for renters against eviction when renters are only asking for a basic standard of living. “Everyone should be entitled to a decent living space that is clean and that works - especially when I’m paying what the government considers a reasonable rate.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnLiving standardsRenting"},{"url":null,"title":"dad who spent 3 months","story":":root Dad who spent  months building epic treehouse for kids ordered to remove it by councilKai Grunwald, , built a huge treehouse ft high for his daughters to play in but Dacorum Borough Council said he should have sought planning permission, giving him  days to remove itDad who spent  months building epic treehouse for kids ordered to remove it by councilKai Grunwald, , built a huge treehouse ft high for his daughters to play in but Dacorum Borough Council said he should have sought planning permission, giving him  days to remove itKai Grunwalk has slammed Dacorum Borough Council after he was ordered to remove the treehouseImage: The Sun   News LicensingByRyan MerrieldReporter:,  May Updated:,  May A dad grafted for three months building a ft high treehouse for his children before a council ordered him to pull it down. Kai Grunwald forked out £, to build the wooden structure - which includes a slide and climbing wall - for daughters Kara, six, and Kayleigh, four. But the -year-old, from Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, said itaposs a case of red tape gone mad after Dacorum Borough Council told him to demolish it within  days. The authority sent Kai, a strategy director, a letter stating the treehouse is a breach of planning regulations because it is over .m in height. The dad admits he should have sought planning permission in hindsight but struggles to understand the councilaposs attitude.Have you had similar issues with a local council  Let us know at webnews@mirror It’s not like I’ve built a block of flats or something like that without permission, I just wanted to do something nice for the girls, Kai told The Sun. One of the great joys for me, apart from their excitement, was the encouragement, smiles and comments I received whilst making it. It was a lovely way to engage with the community. Working on the treehouse on evenings and weekends, Kai said it also helped to distract him from his day job which sees him staring at a computer screen most of the day.  Along with we Kerryn, , he wants to be able to submit a planning application retrospectively and work with the council to ensure everything fits the regulations. However, Kai said DBC has shut that option down and wants the treehouse gone, which he said seems totally unfair. The council raised concerns about the safety of the structure, as it encroaches on a footpath, as well as the visual impact on the street in its letter. However, Kai disputes this, having made it all from high quality material and is adamant it is very safe, while it only marginally overhangs the street path below.

The iant was first detected in Thailand in a person who had travelled from Egypt and tested positive while in a state quarantine. Scientists in the UK will carry out tests to determine whether it reaches the threshold of being a iant of concern. Have you been affected by the C.. coronavirus iant  Email webnews@mirror.  There is currently no evidence that the C.. iant causes more severe disease or renders existing vaccines any less effective, said PHE. At least  countries have reported at least one sequence of the iant as of Wednesday, including Germany, France, Spain and the US, said PHE. C.. is one of nine iants under investigation by PHE, along with other mutations that were first detected in the UK, India and the Philippines.Here is everything we know about the C.. iant so far.Where was it first detected   The C.. iant was first detected in Thailand in a person who had travelled from Egypt. The person tested positive while instate quarantine following their arrival, Thailandaposs government said. The patient was treated and has recovered, the government said. Bangkok slams aposThaiapos iant name C.. has been described in media reports as the Thai iant, a name that has prompted a fierce backlash from ministers in Bangkok. Thailandaposs government on Friday said there is no Thai Covid- iant because the C.. iant has not been found in the domestic infection in that country. The lone case reported in Thailand was the traveller from Egypt.  Supakit Sirilak, director-general of the Department of Medical Sciences, told the Bangkok Post: In principle, the origin was in Egypt. So it could not be called the aposThai iantapos.It should be called the aposEgypt iantapos. The situation highlights concerns that using place names to identy Covid iants creates stigma and puts people from those places at risk of racist or xenophobic abuse. Where has it been found in the UK  Public Health England has identied  confirmed cases in England as of Tuesday. Here is a breakdown by region:London:  Yorkshire  Humber:  East:  North West:  West Midlands:  East Midlands:  South East:  South West:  North East: Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have not reported any cases of the iant. What is happening now  C.. was named a iant under investigation on Monday on the basis of the mutation profile and increased importation from a widening international area. Scientists will carry out tests to determine whether it reaches the threshold of being a iant of concern, such as the Indiaand Kent iants. A iant of concern is a term used to describe a mutation which is more transmissible or more severe. Do vaccines work against the iant  There is nothing to suggest existing vaccines are not effective against the iant. There is no evidence that the iant is more severe than other strains. PHE said: There is currently no evidence that this iant causes more severe disease or renders the vaccines currently deployed any less effective. PHE is carrying out laboratory testing to better understand the impact of the mutations on the behaviour of the virus. All appropriate public health interventions will be undertaken, including additional contact tracing and targeted testing. Where cases have been identied, additional follow-up of cases, testing of contacts andrequired targeted case finding will limit its spread.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMutant CoronavirusCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"four covid symptoms watch out","story":"NewsFour Covid symptoms to watch out for in rare event you get virus after having vaccineWhile statistically very unlikely, researchers have said it is still possible to catch Covid after having the vaccine and certain groups are more at risk than othersmirrorShareCommentsBySam Elliott-Gibbs:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video matt-hancock-more-half-big-,customFields:,clearance:Network,source:bcdccbccd,sourceUrl:sky news,site:Mirror,brandSafety: Sport and specialist news – passed for ad targeting,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:teYcYkZh,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

This is because it can take several weeks for the body to develop protection against the illness and the current vaccines need two doses to be fully effective. Scientists at Kingaposs College in London have been researching cases of infection after vaccine, by examining data from around . million people who had been vaccinated between last December and mid May.  They found that , adults tested positive after vaccination, or just . per cent. That figure drops even further for those who had two doses, with just , or . per cent catching Covid. Researchers identied a number of symptoms to keep an eye out for after youaposve had your vaccine, and weaposve listed them below.. Sneezing Although not included as one of the key symptoms of the disease, scientists say sneezing may need to be monitored. It was  per cent more common in people under  with Covid- after getting their jab. Sneezing was the only symptom which was more commonly reported in vaccinated people with Covid.The Kingaposs College London researchers looked at hundreds of thousands of people in the UK using the ZOE Covid Symptom Study app.But the study found those who had been vaccinated against the virus were less likely to report any of the original symptoms of coronavirus.. Shortness of breath Although a iety of health conditions can trigger shortness of breath, Covid can be one of them. If you are feeling out of breath, or winded after a jab it could be worth getting a test. Vaccinated people with Covid- reported similar levels of shortness of breath, the study says. But itaposs important to note that vaccinated adults who contract Covidv experience a less severe illness than those who havenapost had the jab, researchers added.  Earache is another potential symptom people who have had the Coronavirus vaccine should be aware of.Covid patients who havenapost had the jab have complained of tinnitus, a condition that causes a persistent ringing sound in the ears, and muffled hearing.If you suffer from ear pain in the days after taking the vaccine, it could be a sign youaposve caught the disease.. Swollen glands A less common side effect after the vaccine is swollen glands in the armpit or neck. While they usually go away within a few days, they could also be a sign of infection. However, anyone who has taken the vaccine should be aware that one in four people experience side effects, including sweating, chills, fatigue and aches.

Alta Fixsler, two, suffered a severe brain injury at birth, which doctors say means she cannot eat, drink or draw breath without assistance. Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, which has responsibility for her care, asked a judge to decide whether it is in her best interests to withdraw le-sustaining treatment and put her on a palliative care regime. Lawyers representing the trust told the court that there is no prospect of her ever getting better at a hearing last week. But Altaaposs parents said their Jewish faith means they cannot agree to steps which would lead to her death and want to take her to a hospital in Israel. Do you have a story  Email webnews@mirror.  Their barrister Victoria Butler-Cole QC said: They would like her to be treated in Israel by doctors who share their religious beliefs and ethical framework, and struggle to understand why the trust will not agree to this. Hospitals in Israel are willing to accept Alta, the risks of transfer are very low, and the costs of transporting Alta safely will be met. The parents implore the trust to reconsider their position. In a judgment delivered on Friday, Mr Justice MacDonald ruled that it is in Altaaposs best interests for the treatment that is currently sustaining her precious le now to be withdrawn. He said taking Alta to Israel for treatment to continue there would expose Alta to further pain and discomfort during the course of transfer for no medical benefit in circumstances where all parties accept that the treatment options now available for Alta provide no prospect of recovery.

The judge added: The parents cannot be criticised for having reached a dferent decision informed by the religious laws that govern their way of le. But applying the secular legal principles that I must, and according due respect to the deeply held religious convictions of the parents, I cannot agree with their assessment and am required to act accordingly. Mr Justice MacDonald concluded: It is not in the best interests of Alta for le-sustaining medical treatment to be continued, and ... it is in her best interests for a palliative care regime to be implemented.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorMore OnHigh Court"},{"url":null,"title":"haven holiday parks ban singing","story":"NewsHaven holiday parks ban singing and dancing at resorts ahead of school half-termFamilies are set to descend on the Haven resorts but will only be able to watch pre-recorded shows on a big screen and meet-and-greet characters with social distancingmirrorShareCommentsByKelly-Ann MillsReporterKelly Williams:,  MAY NewsPresthaven Sands in Gronant, Flintshire \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The photos seem to show Britain’s biggest prison looking more like a cheap hotel than a place of punishment. One shows a light and airy double room and single room at Her Majesty’s Prison Five Wells, with brightly coloured walls and unobstructed views over the beautul River Nene and a fishing lake. The UK’s first privately run mega prison in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, which has buildings in the shape of crosses, has just been structurally finished and is set to be completed by October. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  The new-style £ million super prison will hold , inmates, making it England’s biggest prison, with the first prisoner due on January , next year. HMP Five Wells tweeted: “Been a busy day on site today but took the opportunity to grab a couple of pics for you. One of a double room, there are  in total, and one of the single rooms with the FANTASTIC barless window …albeit not the best view at present #bestprisonever.”Like news to one of the Mirroraposs newsletters The category C jail is seen as a flagship example of the Government’s aim to create a “modern, efficient prison estate that is fit for the future” and will have a clear focus on rehabilitating offenders. It will not hold the most dangerous prisoners. It has been built on the site of the former HMP Wellingborough site, which closed in , and held a maximum of  adult male inmates. The jail designers have ditched the usual K-shaped formation of prison housing blocks and instead used seven staggered cross-shaped buildings.  The K-block style has been favoured since Victorian times, with the idea that a single prison officer could be placed in the centre of the radial arms of corridors and survey all the cells quickly. Older jails have come under criticism for overcrowding and filthy conditions in recent years. The new cross-shaped buildings mean the corridors are broken up into smaller zones, rather than miles of long corridors, which will enable prison staff to have more direct contact with prisoners.  The buildings have been arranged around landscaped courtyards, with the cross-shaped design offering a better use of outside space for sports and gardening facilities. The prison’s landscaped grounds will also include four football pitches. There will be one central hub for education, vocational training and social facilities. In  it emerged that the prison will provide more than  jobs for local residents.Speaking when the prison construction was announced, then-Prisons Minister Rory Stewart said: “Providing offenders with decent conditions and regimes is absolutely key to turning their lives around and ultimately keeping the public safe.” FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPrisonsCrime"},{"url":null,"title":"manager sacked after telling receptionist","story":":root Manager sacked after telling receptionist I didnt realise you had t**s until todayWarehouse worker Jonathan Hicks claimed he was trying to reassure receptionist Emily Cox, , after she heard insults from other colleagues at Hertfordshire company Sporting Wholesale LimitedManager sacked after telling receptionist I didnt realise you had t**s until todayWarehouse worker Jonathan Hicks claimed he was trying to reassure receptionist Emily Cox, , after she heard insults from other colleagues at Hertfordshire company Sporting Wholesale LimitedEmily Cox rushed to the toilet in tears after hearing his remark, an employment tribunal heardBySam Elliott-Gibbs:,  May A warehouse worker sacked for talking about a receptionistaposs breasts claimed he was trying to aposreassureapos her after she was called a prostitute by a colleague, an employment tribunal head.

The researchers define a aposhotspotapos as a local authority where there are - or are predicted to be - more than  new cases of Covid- per , of the population per week. Public Health Englandhas identied the North West city as an area to watch based on its own data which shows a growing cluster of confirmed cases of Covid-.Have you been affected by the Indian coronavirus iant  Email webnews@mirror. Blackburn with Darwen, Bedford, Rossendale and Bolton are expected to remain top Covid hotspots for weeks, the Imperial College London map shows. Manchesteraposs probability of becoming a new hotspot by Sunday is  per cent, but it rises to  per cent by June , the researchers said. Separate data from PA shows rates continue to rise across the North West, including Greater Manchester, as the Health Secretary said Covid vaccines are severing the link between cases and hospitalisations and deaths. Burnleyaposs seven-day rate has climbed to  new cases per , people, with a total of  confirmed cases, in the week to May .  It is the seventh highest rate in England, up from . the previous week. Manchesteraposs rate is the eighth highest, going from from . to ,, with  new cases. Bury is ninth with a rate of  , up from . the previous week. Bolton has highest Covid rate Englandaposs highest rates are found in the Indian iant hotspots of Bolton , Blackburn with Darwen , Bedfordand Rossendale , though it appears the Bolton outbreak could be nearing its peak. The latest data from PHE show the Manchester cluster continuing to grow in size.  PHE epidemiologist Meaghan Kall tweeted: By local authority we see Bolton cluster and Bedford continue to increase in size. Other clusters also growing but nothing of note apart from Manchester joining the mix as one to watch. Councillor Joanna Midgley, executive member for health and care for Manchester City Council, said officials are taking robust action to prevent the spread of the iant.She said: “From the week beginning March , vaccinations started to be offered to residents aged  and above in eight city wards.Residents in these wards are at a greater risk of contracting the virusit spreads which is why action was taken sooner rather than later.  “It has been known for a long time that Covid was something we will have to adapt with as the vaccination programme continues.It’s vital that people continue to wear their masks, maintain social distancing and wash their hands to ensure their own safety, and that of their community.” Manchesterapos Director of Public Health David Regan added: “We are closely monitoring confirmed cases of the iant that originated in India, and I want to reassure residents that steps are being taken to prevent its spread. “While viruses mutate and change, it’s important to stress that this is normal and from time to time we will see iants pop up. “There is no evidence to indicate this iant is more dangerous, and preliminary studies have shown that our vaccines are effective against it and prevent people from getting seriously ill. “As always residents should keep wearing their masks, socially distancing and handwashing, and adhering to the most up to date public health guidance.” UK-wide cases of the Indian iant have doubled in a week - from , to , - leading to fresh doubts over the ending of Covid restrictions in England next month. Boris Johnson warned that freedom from restrictions on June  may have to wait. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said up to three quarters of new UK Covid cases could be of the Indian iant, and there are “early signs” that rates in Bolton are starting to “cap out. The Government is waiting for fresh data to find out how the continuing surge has affected hospital admissions, which have increased slightly but remain low across England.  PHE said the hospital admission rate for Covid- was . per , people in the week to May , compared with . per , in the previous week. The daily number of Covid caseshas been increasing, with , announced on Thursday, a week-on-week rise of  per cent. The daily number of deaths has remained level. Promising data from PHE show just three per cent of Britons infected with the Indian iant were fully vaccinated. Almost  per cent had not received a single dose. Other figures show the average age of people testing positive has fallen to , the youngest ever recorded during the pandemic and down from  at the start of the year.  A majority of older Britons have received at least one dose of a vaccine. Meanwhile, a total of , cases of the Indian iant had been detected in England as of Tuesday, a new PHE report found. Of those, involved international travel. By region, the North West had the highest total, with , as of Tuesday, amid surge testing in a number of areas. This accounts for  per cent of Englandaposs confirmed cases of the B... iant. The North West was followed by London, which had  cases, and the East of England, which had . There were  in the East Midlands,  in the South East and  in the West Midlands. The North East had the fewest number of cases , followed by the South Westand Yorkshire  Humber . Mr Hancock said on Thursday that the increase in cases of the Indian iant remained focused in “hotspots” where surge testing and vaccinations were taking place.He said of  people in hospital with coronavirus in Bolton, only five have had both doses of vaccine.Mr Hancock added: “So when you get the call, get the jab, and make sure you come forward for your second doses so you can get the maximum possible protection. “The vaccine is severing the link between cases and hospitalisations and deaths from coronavirus.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirusMutant Coronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownmirrorShareByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Jayden McCarthy abused his position to carry out a series of serious offences against young children at the age of . Staff noticed that the teenager, who raped one child and molested eight others, spent too much time playing with children, allowing them to crawl on him, Devon Live reported. They put his behaviour at the Torquay playgroup down to inexperience. During a trial at Exeter Crown Court it was heard that the offences came to light when a girl came home from nursery and told her parents that an adult called Jayden had sexually abused her. One parent told the court: It was a big shock and we didnapost really know what to do. The parents immediately called the nursery to ask who Jayden was and report what had happened.  I askedthey had someone called Jayden working there as I hadnapost heard of him before then and I askedJayden had got my daughter changed because she had said he had changed her in the toilets. The parents visited the nursery that evening looking for answers and were told McCarthy had been suspended while the claims were investigated. Police launched a major investigation. McCarthy admitted changing the girl out of wet clothes in the toilet but denied any sexual offence. The incident was not captured on CCTV. A member of staff said she noticed he had taken longer than usual to change the child.She went to see what was happening and McCarthy said he was having trouble getting her dressed. McCarthy, from Brixham, was charged with  offences, which he denied.The jury retired yesterday to make their deliberations and ed guilty verdicts to all charges this afternoon. Police searched through more than  hours of other footage from the weeks leading up to the offence to seethere were any other incidents of sexual behaviour. They found  incidents which caused concern.The jury was played clips of CCTV which showed McCarthy sexually assaulting children.He would often sexually assault children while playing with them on the ground or while applying sun cream to their bodies, the prosecution said. Prosecutor Jason Beal said: Over the course of several weeks in  Jayden McCarthy sexually assaulted nine children. These assaults were of ying degrees of seriousness, ranging from touching children over and under clothing in their private areas to an incident of rape. Judge David Evans adjourned the case for a psychiatric and pre-sentence reports to be completed. McCarthy was released on bail and willto the court on Friday, July , for sentencing. Judge Evans said: You have been found guilty on the clearest possible evidence of grave sexual offences against young and very young children, at a time when you yourself were a youth.

The -year-old Liverpool woman raised £, in just a few weeks after being told during the Covid pandemic that she would have to wait up to  more months for treatment on the NHS.She told donors the money would be used to pay for a specialist stretcher and private rehabilitation until she can access treatment on the NHS, the Liverpool Echo reports.Got a story  Email webnews@mirror.  Emma said she has spent her le savings and relies on Universal Credit to get by, and also receives Personal Independence Payments to cover her daily care. When she raised £, and transferred the funds into her bank account, she said she notied the Department for Work and Pensionsand had several cancelled appointments. She then found out her Universal Credit had been stopped when she was in hospital. Emma lodged an appeal but it was turned down and her claim was stopped. She said: “I have taken a lot of blows in the last  years and had to swallow my pride on more occasions than I care to remember. This DWP ruling is by far the most monumental knock to date and feels like the most cruel of blows. I live in a horizontal world and my only outings are to hospitals. I am desperately trying to help myself get to the point where I can live a more fulfilling le than staring at a ceiling all day. This treatment could potentially get me upright enough to be in a wheelchair which would quite literally change my world physically and mentally and put my in a good position to benefit from an NHS rehabilitation programme when one becomes available.  Emma said she will not use any of the donations on living costs. She added: That would be immoral and is not what people donated their hard earned cash for. I am truly devastated and feel like I am lost in a system that does not care. The pandemic has been tough on everyone, but lying on your back for  hours a day for over a year with extremely limited access to visitors has been really, really tough. I genuinely feel thatthe DWP fail to reassess my status they will take away any hope I have of giving myself any chance of rehabilitation. I cannot describe the felling of helplessness or hopelessness I feel today.  She has appealed the DWPaposs decision to stop her benefits and is being helped by welfare lawyer Steven Lunt. Steven said: We will be working tirelessly at Astraea Legal to assist Emma in her challenge with the DWP’s HM Courts and Tribunal Service and hope that the right conclusion in this distressing case will prevail. This is a complete injustice and potentially detrimental to Emma’s failing health causing her to have a substantial worsening in her mental health as a result of the financial restraints and potential possession proceedings which would leave Emma statutory homeless” Emma said she was contacted by a local Job Centre to discuss her situation after the Liverpool Echo approached the DWP for comment.A DWP spokesperson said:“Our Merseyside team is helping Ms Horlock take the necessary steps to re-open her claim and support her during this dficult time. In the meantime, she is in receipt of the highest levels of Personal Independence Payments.” FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnDepartment for Work and PensionsBenefitsUniversal Credit"},{"url":null,"title":"genius shares five words you","story":"NewsGenius shares five words you should start every call with so you can hang up fasterIf you hate talking on the phone and wish there was a way to end a call faster without seeming rude, then a self-proclaimed evil genius on social media has shared the le hack for you...mirrorShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsSome people really dont like talking on the phone\" %, rgba, rgba, url\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your dayInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.SubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

A screengrab from the mapaposs website shows the word bitch spelt out in capital letters in the grass behind a house in Salt Lake City, Utah, with an arrow pointing next door. Hardly a subtle message. A sharp-eyed Reddit user captioned the photo: I donapost think the neighbours get along very well. One commented: Lmao, while another joked epic find.Meanwhile, a woman who thought she had found her dream home was put off buying the property after spotting two disembodied legs on Google Maps.Sally Doherty decided to take a look at the bungalow in Woking, Surrey, on Street View to get a feel for the local area. But she decided it wasnapost for her after discovering the barren landscape surrounding the property, as well as a rather unusual sight. While looking for the property, the house-hunter found a pair of legs cut off at the knees, wearing white socks and black trainers, standing at the side of the country road. Sally, from Kingston on Thames, admitted she was put off the property entirely as it is in the middle of nowhere and the sighting of the rogue legs didnapost help.

The only survivor of the disaster in Stresa, Northern Italy, was a five-year-old Israeli boy, who remains in hospital having lost his family in the tragedy on Sunday. The carriage had been travelling at mph before it plummeted to the ground, and police believe the brakes had been tampered with. Three men have now been arrested on suspicion of aggravated manslaughter as investigations into the crash continue.Among them is cable car manager Luigi Nerini, who could spend decades behind barsconvicted, according to German newspaper Bild. The -year-old and fellow managers Gabriele Tadini and Enrico Perocchio have allegedly admitted to deliberately deactivating the emergency breaking system.Tadini is said to have told magistrates in Italy on Thursday itaposs all my fault, according to Italyaposs la Repubblica newspaper. It is believed that instead of carrying out costly repairs, the brakes were deactivated to overcome a fault. Chief prosecutor Olimpia Bossi said the three managers are facing very high jail terms due to the extraordinary gravity of the situation. It is certainly very serious and very disturbing, he told reporters after the arrests. With the conviction that the cable car would never break, [the men] took the risk which determined the deadly outcome.  Italyaposs Carabinieri Lieutenant colonel Alberto Cicognani has previously said the suspects admitted a fork-shaped clamp had been placed on the safety brake system, preventing it from operating as it should. The cable car had not been working properly, and the brakes constantly kicked in. The clamp stopped them from activating so the cable car could keep running. Five-year-old Eitan Biran was the only survivor when the gondola plunged ft as it travelled from the town of Stresa, on the shore of Lake Maggiore, to the nearby Mottarone mountain.  Eitanaposs father, mother, two-year-old brother and great-grandparents were among those killed, along with a nine-year-old child and their family. Investigators said the initial probe would look at how a lead cable snapped, and why the safety brake mechanism failed to kick in.  The cable car underwent major maintenance work between  and . Checks were carried out in  and again last year by specialist technicians. Transport and Infrastructure Minister Enrico Giovannini visited the area on Monday and said the government would set up a commission to look into Italyaposs worst cable car disaster since  – when  people died after a low-flying US warplane accidentally cut through a supporting cable.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnAccidents"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/Bella-Duke-1-e1622123275228-620x372.jpg ","title":"bella and duke perthshire pet food brand plan to double workforce after 7m investment","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remA Perthshire-based raw pet food company plans to double its workforce in the next two years after a £ million investment.Blairgowrie-based Bella and Duke will get from £ million from the BGF.The remaining £m is provided by existing shareholders, including a further investment from Mobeus.Bella and Duke was formed five years ago by Mark Scott and Tony Ottley after they lost pets to terminal illness.They were convinced an alternative to processed pet foods would have benefited the health of their dogs and developed a range of raw meat and natural ingredients.The products are frozen within  minutes of being made and delivered to customers on a subscription basis.Bella  Duke now delivers more than two million meals across the UK each month.The firm#s staff grew from  at the start of last year to almost .There are plans to double that number in the next two years.Mr Scott, chief executive, said: #This investment will allow us to continue to grow our production line and our distribution centre in Inverkeithing.#We#ll continue to grow.#It has been a challenge to take on new staff during the pandemic, with staff working from home where possible.Mr Scott added: #I#ve not met the majority of the new employees.#We#ve had a lot of Zoom calls. You have to work harder to get the DNA of the company across.#You#ve got to make sure you#re building the message across the team.#The co-founder was delighted with the investment and hopes it will allow the business to grow long-term.It posted revenues of more than £m in its last financial year.Mr Scott said: “Our mission is to provide all British dogs and cats with the best possible nutrition.#This funding round will enable us to continue growing.#Attracting this recent investment demonstrates the long-term potential for Bella and Duke and showcases the signicant opportunity within the raw feeding category.“We’re delighted to be working with our investors for the next phase of the journey.”Peter Farquhar, former chairman of natural petfood brand, Forthglade, will join Bella and Duke as chairman.His appointment is a “phenomenal” boost for the business, according to the chief executive.Mr Scott said: “He’s got a lot of experience in businesses of our size.#“Having a chairman like Peter who has been there and done that several times, it’s great.“To be able to pick up the phone and talk to him about everything is really helpful.”Graham Clarke, investor at BGF, said: “Providing consumers with high-quality raw pet food in a subscription-based model is proving a winning formula.“We are delighted to be supporting Mark, Tony and the Bella and Duke team in their next phase of growth.“We believe they are perfectly placed to deliver the new industry-standard of consumer pet wellness in Great Britain.”Matt Mead from Mobeus said: “Bella and Duke has a great track record in the raw pet food space, and we know there is huge potential for this to continue.“We’re excited to continue working closely with them to grow the business even further.”Newsletter Get top

self-isolating.This was said at the time to be a result of positive cases at six schools in Perth, half the number of schools affected this month.A Perth and Kinross Council spokesperson said: #We

The fact it gave me the opportunity to pause helped me make my decision – I got more information, I got to talk to a lot people.“People were really struggling at that time. I came to understand it was the only option that would be accepted by the majority of the people.“At that time of year, you are living hand to mouth in terms of people coming in the gates.“It wasn’t scaremongering because when you get to that time in the season, the money is thin.“There were clubs really struggling who needed the money.“I took the decision to change my vote. The Premiership and board dealt with what would happen there.“Out of all the votes, around % of the teams voted that way. I had a better understanding of how people would handle it.“I still think we should have helped each other out a bit more – that’s what I was trying to accomplish.If we had clubs going to the sword, what would we have left at the end of the day  That’s what I couldn’t live with.“If I didn’t vote that way, would four or five clubs go out of business “We didn’t have any good choices. We have  clubs you have to try and get facing in the same direction.“When I changed my vote I thought that was the only opportunity to make that happen, get the vote in and get people paid.“There will still be some debate but there was never going to be a good answer.”Speaking last summer after the vote was cast, Nelms indicated his strong support for league reconstruction.His hope then was to find a way, through a total revamp of the game, that wouldn’t see any club relegated.FULL TRANSCRIPT: Dundee chief John Nelms breaks his silence on SPFL vote saga\" title\"#FULL TRANSCRIPT: Dundee chief John Nelms breaks his silence on SPFL vote saga# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp sport football dundee-fc  full-transcript-dundee-chief-john-nelms-breaks-his-silence-on-spfl-vote-saga embed # secretpmzNgVnG\" data-secret\"pmzNgVnG\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"However, he says any hope of that was quickly extinguished once it was clear an agreement between all clubs couldn#t be reached.“Back then we didn’t have enough information,” he added.“Hindsight is  .“We were trying to figure out things every day.“It went from a vote to potentially reconstruction then that wasn’t going to happen and we’re wondering what the league might look like, when would fans be back.“So you were trying to put structure to something where there are no parameters.“It was unbelievably dficult.“My regret is I wish there was a much better solution but I don’t think there was.”Earlier this week Dundee were promoted back to the top flight after beating Kilmarnock in the Premiership play-off final.They finished second to Championship winners Hearts in the regular league campaign and will face the Jambos again in the Premiership next season.Relations between the clubs soured last year after Dundee’s U-turn saw the Edinburgh side relegated.Nelms, though, says the decision for the Premiership to stop was up to top-flight clubs and not down to his change of heart.“I didn’t vote for the Premiership to stop, they did and it was unanimous. There was a vote and it stopped,” he said.“They tried to figure out how to get the games on but we didn’t know about testing and all we can do now back then.“There was nothing they could do and they voted to stop.“We’ve done what we can do to help other clubs. There are people we have sent to Hearts and, hopefully, that’s helped.“There are bigger issues. I understand being relegated is horric, because we have been.“But at the end of the day they are back where they are supposed to be and a club that’s financially strong, I imagine.”Though some clubs were angered by Nelms’ actions, the American says he has received congratulatory messages from nearly every club in the country following Dundee’s win over Kilmarnock.He said: “After promotion, nearly everybody has sent words of congratulations across the board.“A lot of people did across the globe, it was amazing how many people said well done.”Dundee star Cammy Kerr dedicates Premiershipto staff made redundant during COVID- crisis\" title\"#Dundee star Cammy Kerr dedicates Premiershipto staff made redundant during COVID- crisis# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp sport football dundee-fc  dundee-star-cammy-kerr-dedicates-premiership--to-staff-made-redundant-during-covid--crisis embed # secretDBfCjanoZs\" data-secret\"DBfCjanoZs\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"grew-glasgow-its-best-city-world---alexanders-gallowgate-memories","story":"Earliest memory of Glasgow  I remember being scared when the bombs were dropping on Glasgow during the Second World War."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering-janey-buchan-fierce-glasgow-mep-fought-civil-rights","story":" Janey Buchan was a fierce cultural and political activist.

That year inside allowed us the chance to find our proper sound. We had that opportunity to expand our sound.#Thomas agrees, adding: #To begin with the lockdown was really dficult but we all focused on our own aspect of being in a band. As we couldn’t really focus on being together I focused on my song writing and guitar playing.

This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus.The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-.

also known as #Batman# by the fans.It was a lethal partnership that busted nets, not crime.Now Aberdeen have made an ambitious bid to secure Houston Dynamo striker Ramirez, capped twice by the United States.Dons boss Stephen Glass made a bid to sign Ramirez last year when interim manager of Atlanta United, but Houston knocked back the approach.However, Glass has resurrected his interest in a striker, who has just seven months left on his contract.With the ability to score goals, physicality and deliver strong hold-up play, Glass will be confident Scottish defenders will not be Kryptonite to the striker.But who is #Superman# mdash Minnesota United FCAugust , The transformation of Ramirez into #Superman# has been more of a slow burn than Clark Kent quickly donning a costume in a phone box.In truth Ramirez is more akin to Leicester City and England striker Jamie Vary than the DC Comics crime-buster in that he has taken the unconventional route from the lower leagues up through the pyramid structure to the top.Ramirez began his career at Concordia University in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athleticsbefore moving to Orange County Blue Star.He then sealed a switch to Charlotte Eagles in the American third ision, which was then know as the USL Pro League, in , received one-to-one striker coaching during that time with Aberdeen assistant manager Allan Russell via his Superior Striker enterprise.Ramirez began his career as a defensive midfielder and cites his hero as Italy, Juventus and AC Milan legend Andrea Pirlo.He wore number  for most of his career in homage to Pirlo.However, it was when moved into a centre-forward role Ramirez rapidly earned a reputation as a prolic scorer and netted four goals in three play-off appearances to fire the Eagles to the USL Pro Championship final, where they lost to Orlando City SC.In front of , spectators, Ramirez netted twice in the final, but it wasn#t enough to prevent the Eagles losing -.On that game, Ramirez said: #That was the largest crowd I had ever played in front of.#To score twice in that environment assured me that I belong at that stage and I could hang in front of that many people.#That form did not go unnoticed and secured a move to Minnesota United in the NASL, the then-American second ision.In his first three years at Minnesota United, the striker was named in the league#s top XI team of the season.That debut season yielded  goals for Ramirez, including a sensational over-head bicycle kick that won the Goal of the Year award.During his time at Minnesota, he forged a partnership and friendship with Ibarra.That partnership saw both players excel with Ibarra becoming the first NASL Modern Era player to receive a call-up to the United States national team.His team-mate Ramirez would follow into the international set-up soon after.In  appearances for Minnesota United in the NASL, Ramirez netted  goals.Minnesota United then stepped up to Major League Soccer, the top-flight, in  and Ramirez was one of their key performers # netting  goals.That earned a debut call-up to the United States squad for a friendly against Bosnia and Herzegovina in January , although he did not play.He  finally earned a debut cap a year later in a - defeat of Panama on January  # and scored.In that scoring international debut, Ramirez drted in behind the two centre-backs with perfectly timed movement to meet a low cross from Jonathan Lewis and then calmly convert from six yards.The commentator hailed Ramirez as a player who had been a goal scorer all his career.The commentator said: #The doubters continue to fuel the fire for Christian Ramirez, but he continues to score goals.#His entire career, his entire le, he has been a goal-scorer.#Right spot, right time.#What a moment in your debut.#Although a fans# favourite and key player for Minnesota United, the striker was then transferred to Los Angeles FC in the MLS.He had a frustrating spell at Los Angeles, scoring four goals from  appearances.Houston Dynamo moved to sign him in August  and the attacker had a strong end to the campaign, netting five times in  games and pitching in with a number of assists.However, it was not enough to prevent Houston failing to reach the play-offs.Although Glass# bid to land Ramirez for Atlanta United last year was rejected, Houston head coach Tab Ramos would now be prepared to let Ramirez go to free up wages.Now Glass# interest in the striker has been resurrected, there could be obstacles in the way to Aberdeen getting a deal done.The Dons would need to agree a deal with Major League Soccer, because all league contracts are centralised.Another complication is a work permit as Ramirez is unlikely to meet the current criteria.Any move may have to go through the appeals process and Aberdeen would have to put forward the case that Ramirez will be beneficial to Scottish football.A journey from the lower reaches of American soccer could have another chapter with a move to Scotland #those hurdles can be negotiated.Ramirez is known as #Superman#  #he can deliver goals for Aberdeen, every member of the Red Army will be a superfan of the striker.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/KEX-220521-01-002_39071863-1-558x372.jpg ","title":"stoneywood dyce captain jamie king lays down home form gauntlet","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remStoneywood-Dyce captain Jamie King has challenged the Aberdeen side to make People#s Park one of the most formidable grounds in the Eastern Premier League.Back-to-back victories in their opening weekend of fixtures #

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"from cradle to grave","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside kids vote for nature","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And then there#s the goats.Leaving the harbour car park, turn right and follow the road back up the hill for m.You will pass two minor roads on your right, the turning to Port Righ on your left.Continue until the school is on your left and immediately look for a forestry road to your right .Turn right on to the track, keeping the car park to your left. Ignore a small path to your right and continue to a T-junction.Turn rightpast the village playing fields, with woods to your left. After m, turn left at a fork in the track into the woodland .The track meets the other route just ahead.

However, there now seems to be an acceptance in Transport Scotland that a new solution has to be found.In a letter to the press, George Allan points out that the -mile route from Strathlachlan to Colintraive and the eight miles between Ormidale and Tighnabruaich were designed and constructed in  or  years.I was a member of the survey and design team on these routes. I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.Philip Shimmin, Inverness.Sir,I would like to say thank you to all the lads who have been working at the Crinan Canal # often when the north winds were blowing and water was pouring down from the hills into the empty canal more quickly than the pumps were able to remove it.The men greeted me each morning as I walked past to go over the temporary bridge.

With the evenings getting longer and brighter you can use your garden or patio as a great extension to your home and just sit back and relax.It’s at this time of year that lawns need to be mowed more frequently, so here are some key pointers on getting that perfect cared-for look.Mow at least once a week and raise the mower blades when it’s very hot weather. Don’t mow when grass is wet or during a drought and don’t collect your clippings during dry spells as this helps conserve moisture.Keep watering throughout the summer unless there is a water shortage and repair bare patches with turf or re-seeding.This is also the month to ensure that all your plants are adequately fed, particularly those in baskets and tubs.Plants benefit from a regular feeding programme as they are growing vigorously and need their nutrition levels to be kept up. Slow-release granules are a good idea for pots and baskets because they last for about six months and release food as it is required into the compost.Not often thought of as a container plant, but an excellent option for small gardens, is a rose.A simple solution for June is to create an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.Just buy a selection of dferent sized pots, plant them with a ieties of roses and then place them together in a group.There is a rose for every garden situation. From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew. Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and midsummer day arrives, here are few ‘must do’ jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters a unique holiday destination","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But never mind, Chinese astronauts, who regard a moon base as essential for probing outer space, have just about solved these problems with a bioregenerative le support system called Yuegong-, or Lunar Palace  . LP is a temperature and humidity-controlled, sealed, articial human-animal-plant-microorganism ecosystem in which oxygen, water and food sources are recycled to create an Earth-like environment. The latest experiment had LP in use continuously for a whole year, with two crews of four each having two periods of occupation and the maximum stay being  days. All emerged fit and healthy.LP comprises a living area, two cabins for growing plants , an animal-raising room housing yellow mealworms and waste treatment and storage rooms.Crew requirements # food, water, oxygen and waste disposal # are accommodated as follows: plants and mealworms provide food, the latter being processed into ‘flour’ for bread.Plant photosynthesis provides oxygen and consumes CO, while puried water from plant transpiration and condensation provides drinking and washing water.Nitrogen puried from crew urine generates plant fertiliser, while the remaining urine is puried along with waste water for plant irrigation.Crew faeces mixed with straw are fermented by bacteria to produce CO for plant photosynthesis, while fermented vegetable waste is fed to the mealworms. The whole system achieved  per cent recycling, the only non-recyclable product requiring storage being solid waste from fermented faeces.All this represents huge progress, but we are not there yet. Running LP requires massive energy input, particularly since lunar days and nights each last an Earth month, and the nights are freezing.But still, I have read of plans to build kilometre-high lunar towers bearing solar  , possible because of the moon’s zero gravity, but don’t hold your breath!* https:doi.org . ...# arxiv.org abs ."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 21 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy running a mok but please do so safely","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"safety first as shops reopen","story":"Wyvex MediaUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It#s a really exciting move as it offers the potential to climb the Scottish football pyramid.#From the club#s point of view, we want to find our standard amongst the new teams joining the set up.#We want to be the best we can be as the senior team of the Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.#With our acceptance into the WoSFL, we can offer a pathway for the youngest age groups right through to the under- side, being trained by Stuart Crossan, into our first team, representing Campbeltown in non-league football.#With that, it#s important to acknowledge the huge amount of hard work that has gone into making Campbeltown#s community club a Gold Merit Award holder, one of only seven clubs in the Scottish Football AssociationWest region, encompassing all of Glasgow and the west. This accolade was a major factor in our acceptance into the WoSFL.#Other factors in the Pupils# favour before WoSFL committee scrutiny included having changing facilities for two teams of up to  players each, a separate referee#s room, and an enclosed ground with spectator barriers.Campbell said of the club#s Kintyre Park home: #The renovation of the pavilion is nearing completion, through a fundraising campaign led by club chairman Alex McKinven.#Campbell added: #The SAFL was a great  for us to play competitive amateur football for  years. In periods, we went through some wilderness years but we have happy memories of successful title-winning seasons, too.#In recent seasons, however, the club became disillusioned with how the league was going, with dficulty getting referees and sometimes teams to travel to Kintyre at a week#s notice – this was not a feature against even rival teams in years gone by.#In the WosFL, our geography could not be a determining factor in league entry as we are SFA West region members, which meant that the criteria we could meet on a match day, and the quality of our community club pathway, mattered most.#Meanwhile, the Pupils are gearing up for le in the WoSFL with contact training resuming on Tuesday evening.The team have been training twice weekly in a non-contact setting to build up their base fitness since March.Campbell added: #Training has been well attended, led by coaches Norman Thomson and Lewis Mackay, and although it has been hard to get the players together with ongoing restrictions, the squad are right behind the move and excited about the challenge ahead.#Campbeltown Pupils are keen to hear from anyone who would be able to help with ground and park maintenance.

As German troops advanced through Normandy, the st fought valiantly, protecting French citizens, hoping evacuation by sea would be forthcoming.On June  , German tanks surrounded the ision at the French fishing port of St Valéry. This, alongside a curtain of heavy fog, made the long-awaited flotilla rescue unviable and they were forced to surrender. Those who were not killed in the fighting were captured as prisoners of war and marched to camps in Eastern Europe, where they remained for five gruelling years.Following the commemorations to mark the th anniversary of the battle last June, a remarkable story has emerged. One brave soldier miraculously evaded capture and was taken in by a French family who hid him from the occupying German forces.#We were contacted by Monsieur Patrick Prieur, a -year-old St Valéry resident whose grandparents and father remained in the town during the entirety of the war. He told us the story of the escapee and the tragedy that befell him,# said Dr Claire Armstrong, chief executive of Legion Scotland.#As we approach the st anniversary of the battle, we hope to identy this Scottish hero, give him the recognition he deserves and bring peace to his family.#Patrick Prieur recalled the tale his late father told him: #A soldier from the st Highland Division was hidden by a family in the village. They bonded and the family learned he was a married man with a we and two daughters waiting for him tohome.#For several weeks, the soldier remained hidden but, regretfully, he was eventually discovered by German troops and marched through the town to the municipal cemetery.#After being forced to dig his own grave, he was positioned against the cemetery wall and shot. His death deeply upset the townspeople, who had been aware of his hiding, and especially my father, who was only  at the time.#In later years, the Franco-British military cemetery was built and his body was moved there. His grave is marked as #Known unto God# and my father and other villagers tended to it for decades after the war ended.#Monsieur Prieur added: #My father had been gted a piece of paper on which the soldier#s name was written, #Keller Len Scott#, and this became his prized possession. He desperately wanted to find the soldier#s family to tell them what had happened to their beloved and where he was laid to rest, but having very little information, he struggled.#In  my father passed away and, being eager to finish what he started, I recently contacted Poppyscotland and the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association to ask for help.#Michelle McKearnon, head of engagement at the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association, said: #We started to do our own research to unearth the fallen soldier#s identity but only got so far. We believe the name order on the piece of paper may have been written in military fashion, with the surname preceding any given names, so the family name might be Keller.#We#re now at an impasse, struggling to find additional information through our own resources, so we need the knowledge of the wider community to continue our efforts.#Dr Armstrong added: #We are urging anyone who believes they know of or has any information about our #Unknown Soldier#, no matter how small, to get in touch.#This brave man fought valiantly for his country and to repay our debt to him for his service would be an honour, not only for Legion Scotland as custodians of remembrance, but for his family, Monsieur Prieur#s father, the people of St Valéry and, ultimately, for all the #unknown soldiers# who sacriced their lives for us.#Anyone with information that could help identy the soldier should visit poppyscotland.org.uk stvalery"},{"url":null,"title":"engines at the ready mach 1 stages rally gets go ahead","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Everything looked fine on the yacht, which was built in Argyll at Alexander Robertson#s Holy Loch yard to compete in the America#s Cup of .#As a precaution, we did not have the boys on board for the tough leg round the Mull of Kintyre to Arran,# said crew member Roger Finbow.#They haven#t missed the race they were on board Blue Damsel, carrying the girls# team.#The decision proved a wise move as not only did the rudder come loose leaving the yacht with no steering, it was flapping wildly and in danger of damaging the hull.As a precaution, the leboat crew put a heavy-duty pump on board but this was not needed.HMS Dragon broke off her sea trials to come to the aid of Sceptre. The Type  Clyde-built destroyer stood by until the leboat arrived.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOCalls were mounting earlier this week for a Scottish Office decision on the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Northern Ireland.The Scottish Office has been considering a business plan for state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne to operate the link with Ballycastle in Northern Ireland since the beginning of February.The company needs Scottish Office permission to become involved in the project.But concern is growing that unless a decision is made soon the necessary harbour work at Campbeltown will not start until it is too late for the service to begin next year.Two Campbeltown ambulance men were among six from Argyll recently presented with long service and good conduct medals by the Duke of Argyll.Ronnie Hamilton and Malcolm Black travelled to Oban for the presentation, carried out by the Duke on behalf of HM Queen.The medals are not awarded automatically but are made on the recommendation of a special .The Duke told the ambulance men: #What you do is not a profession, it is a vocation.#He also paid tribute to their families, pointing out the ambulance men worked anti-social hours for long periods at a time.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown was #switched on# to colour television on Tuesday by the town#s new Provost, William Craig, in his first official engagement.The service has been brought to Campbeltown by Redfusion, the firm which pipes television to several thousand subscribers from its mast at Crosshill Farm.The firm#s Scottish general manager Mr Colin Payne said that Redfusion offers a public service of which they were proud.#We looked at the television problems here. There were just BBC and STV and occasionally Ulster in the town.#We said can we bring to Campbeltown the full range of colour programmes which are available where and the answer to that was #yes#.#There are now six programmes on the system. There aren#t many places in the country which can receive this.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAn English steam liner which called in here for bait one day last week had full bunkers and a plentul reserve of coal in ious corners. She had gone to Ostende for the fuel.A further restriction of the gas supply in the burgh comes into force on Saturday night. The hours during which there will be reduced and normal pressure respectively are given in advertisement.The local branch of the Miners# Union opened a subscription list this week for the purpose of starting a communal soup kitchen. It is not intended, of course, to confine the benefits of the scheme to miners or their dependents. Over £ has already been raised and the committee intend to publish the list of subscriptions next week.A welcome break in our comparative isolation from the mainland was made at the beginning of the week when the steamer Kinloch made a special run to the upper reaches, with mail, passengers and cargo.Many merchants, not only in Campbeltown but at Carradale and the west of Arran ports, were carrying very low stocks and this run was not made a day too soon to prevent absolute scarcity of not a few necessities.Flour, for one thing, was running very short, and the new supplies got by bakers were very much-needed.Alcohol is again tipped as a likely rival to petrol. The new motor fuel is being produced by the Distillers Company Ltd and consists of a mixture of  per cent of alcohol,  per cent of benzole and  per cent of paraffin. The idea of using alcohol is not new, but a fatal obstacle has been the unwillingness of the government to release its hold upon alcohol and permit it to be used for commercial purposes."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and Be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.This week, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulancemarks its eighth anniversary – after a year like no other.Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, our Helimed crews have never missed a beat maintaining our emergency helicopter air ambulance service across Scotland#s mainland and island communities. In fact we#ve enhanced our service with the launch of a new aircraft – Helimed  in Aberdeen last year – which has already had a huge impact on pre-hospital care in the Grampian, Highland and island regions.In our busiest year ever, our aircrew have endured challenging working conditions, with additional procedures and cumbersome protective and safety equipment as they go about an already dficult and stressful job.But they#re not complaining – this is what the Scottish public ask of them, to save and improve lives, wherever the need arises, and they fulfil their role with courage and pride.Our exemplary performance during this national crisis has been a tribute to how far SCAA has come in just eight years and I, for one, am immensely proud of what the SCAA team has achieved.But our operational teams are acutely aware that we are only able to provide this critical service, thanks to the continued public donations which you have maintained throughout these dficult times. So you are the real heroes in our charity.SCAA is the people#s helicopter – funded by the people of Scotland, for the people of Scotland – and our two frontline aircraft are stood by ready to help you, your family, your friends, colleagues, neighbours or anyone in your community when you most need us.As we mark our eighth birthday on May , we are asking the people of Scotland,they can, to support us into the future. Any donation, however small, to celebrate our anniversary will help to save a le – just like the numerous lives we have already saved over almost , missions.SCAA vows to continue to transform emergency care in Scotland, particularly to our rural and island communities, with your support. Thank you.As a coalition of leading providers of care and support to vulnerable children and young people, we congratulate all MSPs on their election and welcome the consensus there is between the major political parties to tackle the growing mental health crisis in our young people.We have for some time raised concerns over a potential lost generation of vulnerable children and young people, whose mental health is being impacted even further by the Covid- pandemic.There have been dramatically increased waiting times for mental health treatment during lockdown.In December , for example,  per cent of children and young people had been waiting more than a year for specialist treatment, compared with . per cent in , a truly frightening statistic.A commitment by MSPs to focus on mental health, increasing investment in support services and intervention strategies, must be a priority for this parliament, giving our young people the care and support they need, when they need it.The frightening statistics on the deteriorating mental health of many young people presents a compelling case for a radical new plan for our struggling mental health services and for a national crusade to address what is a mental health pandemic, underpinned by considerably greater resourcing.This is a crisis we can overcome, but it will require a similar energy and commitment to that demonstrated for Covid-we are to achieve this and prevent many young people giving up on their futures.At sight loss charity RNIB Scotland, we are concerned the Covid- crisis might have impacted on people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older.We would like to highlight the emotional reassurance and practical help we offer during the coronavirus lockdown and its aftermath.Covid has eclipsed all other health news in the past year but  people still start to lose their sight in Scotland every week. Add to that stress over Covid and the lockdowns and there could be more people needing support and reassurance.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute and the Western Highlands for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as families, friends and carers.Losing your sight can be devastating news to take in. But our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.The uncertainty during the Covid lockdown over access to basic shopping and medication, a lack of information in accessible formats, the social isolation, the barriers to being guided because of social distancing # these have all added to and compounded the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.But we want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.To contact the Need to Talk service, phone the RNIB Helpline on    or email needtotalk@rnib.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types, providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew.Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and Midsummer#s Day arrives, here are few #must do# jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:CAPTION:June is the perfect month for creating an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.

Mr Mitchell acknowledged receipt of these answers.I was alarmed and saddened by the headline #Failing# school is #betraying# pupils and the community# in last week#s Courier.Coming from a retired Campbeltown Grammar Schoolteacher, it is hard to believe that someone who has worked in the profession could have such criticism for his her fellow colleagues.Although clearly passionate about the future of CGS, perhaps retirement has helped this inidual forget what a challenging job all school staff face.It is commonly known that CGS has not had its troubles to seek in recent years with major staff shortages due to ill health and other unforeseen circumstances.The league tables do not make good reading but, on their own, I don#t think they reflect the efforts of the staff.It is a well known fact that you can take a horse to water but you cannot make it drink. Is the behaviour of pupils the greatest barrier to success Despite the efforts of teachers to discipline the pupils, there are few deterrents for the offenders, especially where the pupil is aware that,they ask, the parent will fight their corner instead of backing the school.The responsibility of teaching our children to behave and respect others needs to be instilled from early years by us all and not just when the child reaches CGS.Maybe the retired teacher should offer his her skills and visit CGS and see the problems that all staff are facing It is time for the community to pull together and support our school and encourage our children to believe that a good education is very achievable in CGS.Recently, an investigation by the Herald newspaper uncovered that #just over half of Scotland#s leline ferry network is operating outwith its working le expectancy#, with  vessels out of  in operation over  years old.Despite the huge challenges created by the Covid- pandemic that our hard-working ferry crews have to deal with,  residents rightly expect a high quality ferry service that runs on time and has enough space to ensure they can travel to and from the islands, businesses can transport goods to the mainland and tourists can visit our islands to boost the economy.Unfortunately, cancellations and delays continue to plague routes. I have been working closely with residents, our community councils and other parties to find long-term solutions.This pressing matter simply can#t be left on the backburner.The  National Lottery Awards are now open for entries.Once again, the annual search for the UK#s favourite National Lottery-funded people and projects will recognise those iniduals and organisations who have made an extraordinary impact in their community – especially during these unprecedent times.National Lottery players raise £ million every week for good causes and we know this money is being used in amazing and inspiring ways.As part of The National Lottery Awards, we want to celebrate those whose selfless dedication and fantastic work makes such a dference in villages, towns and cities across the country.Encompassing all areas of National Lottery funding, you nominate local legends and hometown heroes in the following categories: culture, arts and film, community charity, heritage and sport.In addition, there will be a young hero award for someone under the age of .Groups or organisations are eligible to enter The National Lottery Project of the Year category, where shortlisted finalists will face a public vote later in the year.All award winners will receive an iconic National Lottery Awards trophy and £, for their organisation.Nominations can be made by completing an entry form on our website at www.lotterygoodcauses.org.uk awards.All nominees must have been funded by The National Lottery or be associated with a National Lottery funded project. Entries must be received by midnight on June .Now, as we approach summer with hopefully fewer restrictions, we can start to make plans about how we will spend time with family and friends.Following the challenging year we have experienced, we could all do with a bit more play in our lives. Play is a hugely important part of childhood and has a whole host of benefits, including improving physical and mental health and wellbeing.Throughout this pandemic, children have had to deal with so many dficult challenges some having to stay in unsafe homes and many living with families who are struggling with health worries and financial issues.Children have told Childline that they have struggled to cope and their mental health has suffered as a result.It doesn#t matter how people choose to play this Childhood Day , whether it#s organising a sponsored kickabout in the park, a game of cards, a musical get-together or an online gaming tournament, we just want as many as possible playing and raising money to help us keep children safe.We look forward to hearing how your readers plan to support the NSPCC and children across Scotland this Childhood Day.To find out more and download a fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk childhoodday or search online for NSPCC Childhood Day."},{"url":null,"title":"look out little explorers about","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is a big commitment for the school, requiring  hours of #on site# work.After finding out about Scottish-born American naturalist John Muir, his love for nature and his environmental work, the children mapped along their nearest beach and undertook a beach clean.Nearby, the pupils discovered a trig point and a lookout or watchtower.They are interested in finding out more about Kintyre#s lookout towers and are appealing to Courier readers with any information or stories to send them letters to: Rhunahaorine Primary School, Tayinloan, Tarbert, PA XG.Some of the children are also interested in the rocks on the beach beside the lookout tower at Rhunahaorine.They collected ious examples and took turns smashing them in the hope of finding geodes – crystals or other mineral matter – inside. They discovered lots of interesting patterns but no real geodes – this is perhaps a lelong project for some.Other pupils are interested in the shells and crabs on the beach. Crabs #body parts# are often collected and it is deemed a good finda moveable claw or leg can be worked.During one visit, the youngsters searched for shark egg cases and, after what seemed to be a fruitless hunt, more than  were found in one morning when their eyes became accustomed to what they were searching for. Their findings were submitted to the Shark Trust.Head teacher Catriona Brown told the Courier she was #very impressed# with the children#s enthusiasm and commitment throughout the project so far.Mrs Brown hopes to be able to share in the near futureany of the children achieve the award."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 28 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Did he feel embarrassed in front of his friends who did not share his doubts, did he feel ashamed that his faith had not remained resolute or was he able to put those feelings aside and share the joy of the risen Lord We do know that Thomas responded with the words: #My Lord and my God.#More than two thousand years later, we may feel embarrassedour faith falters and doubts set in.However, we should focus on the happiness of which Jesus speaks.Have the strength and hope to echo the words of Thomas: #My Lord and my God.#Do not beat yourself up for doubting – have the strength to believe."},{"url":null,"title":"bbcs-money-nothing-salvages-items-kinwegar-recycling-centre-wallyford","story":"Salvage superhero Sarah Moore was at the East Lothian Council-run site at Kinwegar recently to pick up unwanted goods, give them a new lease of le and turn them into cash for their original owners.The presenter spoke to three East Lothian men ndash two from Musselburgh and one from Elphinstone ndash who arrived at the skips to dispose of the three items.They were delighted to hand them over to her and appear on the programme, which was aired on BBC last month.Michael Clague, the owner of the four-man tent, from Musselburgh, said it was ldquopast its use-by date.He said: ldquoIrsquom just glad the tent is going to be recycled as it was sitting in our garage for some time.Sarah took it to award-winning bag maker Neil Wragg, who turned the old tent into  tote bags, which were sold to people all over the country via social media.Sarah visited the Honest Toun to hand over pound to Michael, who said he would use the cash for a homecoming for his son, who was at sea, and donate some to the Tranent-based Walk with Scott Foundation to help with its charity work.Another Musselburgh man, Alan, was getting ready to throw away a glass-topped coffee table.

James VI also came to the Bass in  as a guest of a later Lauder he liked the island so much that he offered to purchase it, but here he was snubbed.During the reign of Charles II, the Bass became a notorious prison, mainly used for the Covenanters.As many as  of these religious dissidents were held on the island, under appalling conditions: there was a well that produced fresh water, but fresh meat was a scarcity and the fishy taste of the seabirds was a torment to the wretched prisoners.In , four Jacobite officers were imprisoned on the Bass but they successfully took over control of the island and ordered the garrison to depart. After reinforcements had been received, they withstood a siege of nearly three years, under trying conditions, before they surrendered with full military honours in May .The Bass later passed into the ownership of the Dalrymple family, to which it still belongs today.The Bass Rock lighthouse was constructed in  by the celebrated engineer David Stevenson, a cousin of Robert Louis. He made sure that parts of the old castle were demolished for the stone to be harvested to build the -metre lighthouse, which served its purpose well for many years to come.It was lit with gas derived from vaporised paraffin oil for many years, monitored by the lighthouse keeper.Since , when the lighthouse was converted to electricity and remotely controlled, the lighthouse keeper was no longer needed, and the Bass Rock has been without any permanent human resident.From his house lsquoRockstowesrsquo on Melbourne Road, the celebrated postcard artist Reginald Phillimore enjoyed uninterrupted views of the Bass Rock.He had a fascination with the island, visited it many times and wrote a guidebook that he published himself.The Bass Rock is home to the largest gannet colony in the world: , birds spend their summer residence here, having been in Africa for the winter.The gannet, or lsquosolan goosersquo as it was known in Phillimorersquos time, is a large and formidable-looking seabird, with a white body, a yellow neck and head, and black and white speckled wings and tail.The reason that much of the Bass Rock appears white from a distance is the sheer number of birds and their acrid droppings.The gannet hunts fish by ing headlong into the sea, as any visitor to the Bass Rock can observe at close range.The air is full of birds, which are squawking cacophonously, and the smell from their droppings is very noticeable.Phillimore made some beautul postcards featuring the Bass Rock gannets he is likely to have travelled to the island from Canty Bay or on a vessel from North Berwick, but nowadays access to the Bass can be arranged via the Scottish Seabird Centre.This is an edited extract from Jan Bondesonrsquos book R.P.

Im on an electric bike and that bead slipping down my cheek is most certainly rain ndash even on the steepest of South Devon hills, Ive barely broken a sweat.Its my second morning in the South Hams region of Devon, located between Torbay and Plymouth and bordering the Dartmoor National Park to the north. Its an all-day drive from Scotland down the M but worth it when you get there, especiallyyou break your journey on the way down and back. There are flights from Glasgow and Edinburgh to Exeter and the train is always an option.Its an area with a strong rural and maritime heritage, where sandy beaches rub up against rich coastal grasslands. And its so pretty, its a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty .Naturally beautul it may be, but exploring on two wheels has largely lacked appeal to the average South Devon visitor, due to the relentless and often steep hills. Thankfully, e-Xplore Devonhave made cycling here more accessible .There are suggested cycling routes on the e-Xplore website, and the -mile Beach Circuit is a delicious amble along coastal roads and through quaint villages. I dismount in the tiny hamlet of Thurlestone and admire its th century thatched roofs and its glorious bay , before continuing to Bolberry Down, a long stretch of rugged coastline.The route continues east and I refuel at The Winking Prawn , a family-run seafood restaurant on Salcombe North Sands beach. Beer fans should order the aptly named Prawn Juice, which is brewed in partnership with the South Hams Brewery.I continue on my cycle and initiate turbo mode, mainly because Im full of garlic prawns and dont fancy a stitch. The route flanks the Salcombe estuary ndash its vibrant blue waters punctuated with small white sailing boats ndash before turning back inland. I finish back at the e-Xplore showroom in Kingsdown and space permitting, you can leave your car there whilst you cycle. The crew at e-Xplore can also drop your bike directly to your accommodation.The rainy weather and long cycle have me craving some home comforts, so I head back to my rustic but extremely cosy shepherds hut. Located at the Salcombe Shepherds Hutsare an excellent choiceyou want a slightly more luxurious camping experience. The four huts are handcrafted using local and sustainable wood, and each includes a log burner , and a fully-equipped kitchen.Im in the Foxes Den which has an en-suite toilet , a comfy double bed , and a small leather couch. I enjoy my morning coffee at the picnic table with its views of the Kingsbridge Estuary and flocks of sheep grazing in the surrounding fields.The next morning Im zipping along country roads to Bigbury-on-Sea, where Im booked in for a surfing lesson with Discovery Surf School . All equipment is provided and Im thankful for a super-thick wetsuit, as the temperature is barely hitting double digits.We start on the beach as Matt, our instructor, guides us through the basics. Were soon in the water and Matts constant encouragement fills us with enthusiasm and motivation, even after numerous wipeouts. Slowly but surely we start to stand, unsteady but feeling accomplished. There are just three of us in my group, but the maximum size is six, so expect lots of useful feedback .Catching tiny waves makes me hungry and I drive the  minutes to Hope Cove, an old fishing village with two sheltered beaches . I settle in at the Lobster Pod Bistrowhich youll find perched on the hillside above Harbour Beach. I gorge on the Seafood Platter, which includes todays catch , alongside potted crab, prawns and a selection of salads.Visitors can sit on outdoor benches or self-contained podsand all have views of the ocean and the grassy Bolt Tail headland . I spend the next hour marvelling over the view. The sun has made an appearance and Im lapping it up with a pint of Salcombe Pale Ale .The small town of Salcombe is one of South Devons most popular , and its independent shops, award-winning restaurants and waterside cafes make it worth a day or two of exploring.Parking can be hectic, so leave the car at your shepherds hut and jump on the number  Tally Ho! bus from Yarde Gate Nursery . Alternatively, you can take the scenic, but extremely hilly, -minute walk into town via the village of Batson.Gin fans should visit the Salcombe Distilling Co. , located on Island Street. Every bottle of Salcombe Gin is distilled here using a single copper still . Tasting sessions include a tour and lots of samples .The distillery also runs a Gin School, which allows visitors to create their own bespoke gin recipe. Youll take charge of a miniature copper under the watchful eye of an expert distiller, who will guide you through the process of choosing botanicals and naming your unique creation. Take your bottle home or enjoy it at the waterside Distillery Bar .Along the street from the distillery, youll find the Salcombe Dairy , which has been churning ice cream for over  years. Over half a million litres of the stuff is pasteurised, churned and packaged each year beneath their shop on Island Street, and theyve recently started making bean to bar chocolate as well. Must-try ice cream flavours include Honeycomband Rum and Raisin .My final evening is spent at waterside restaurant Dick and Wills . Its April and UK government guidelines mean were sitting outside in the freezing wind, but luckily the team are on hand with heaters. The salad from my Asian chilli beef starter gets blown into the estuary, but my main course, a Prime Devonshire steak burger topped with vintage cheddar and a side of chips, proves to be a sturdier and equally delicious option.The rain arrives, but Ive learnt to embrace it this time, because its not a British trip to the seaside without a healthy serving of wind, rain and, well, soggy chips.For details of places to stay, visit or experience in and around Salcombe, visit salcombeinformation."},{"url":null,"title":"gardening-safe-plant-tender-veg","story":"Gardening: When is it safe to plant out tender veg Tomatoes and chillies in a bowIts just about time to plant out tender veg safely - or is it The rise and fall of temperatures this spring - April started off warm and dry, but ended up being the frostiest April in  years - has left some gardeners in a quandary about when to plant out their tender edibles, including courgettes, tomatoes and chillies.Gardening expert, bestselling author and presenter, Alys Fowler, says that a handful of tender crops need to bake in warm conditions, and sulkthey are subjected to cold and wet.\"Chillies, tomatoes and aubergines should have already been sown, although you could get away with sowing courgettes and possibly sweetcorn in mid-May,\" says Fowler, whose new book Eat What You Grow offers a wealth of advice on growing fruit and veg.As a general rule, tender plants that have been sown indoors can be taken outside between mid-May and early June, depending on where you live, but only when all danger of frost has passed.Tender plants will need to be hardened off - acclimatised gradually and with protection, whether it be a cold frame, greenhouse, sheltered porch or under a cloche, she advises.Tomatoes\"To have good tomato growth you need night-time temperatures to remain above  degrees, and preferably -C. The cold spring doesnt mean they cant go outside, but they really do need to be protected.\"They need to be in a patio greenhouse, or something like that. You can use a cold frame but really the best tomatoes are grown in a greenhouse in this country.\"Growing them outside means you are growing them really late and you wont get tomatoes until September. They need heat and sun to ripen. Dont expect to be eating them in June.\"Some ieties are better for growing outside, such as Gardeners Delight, Kenilworth and Matts Wild Cherry.\"She says hardening off takes two or three weeks, and dont just turf them out on a really sunny day, as the change in conditions can cause the plants stress and they may wilt as they try to adjust.Top tip: \"The more room that you give your tomatoes, the better they will grow. Put them in the biggest pot you possibly can. The more root mass, the healthier the plant. And as soon as you see the flowers, start feeding the plant every week.\"Chillies\"Chillies are like tomatoes, they really need heat. They come from South America and want to bask in the heat. A good place to grow them is on your windowsill, butyou are growing them outside, it needs to be a really sheltered, sunny spot like a sunny courtyard or patio.\"They make a lovely houseplant, although some grow to ft, while others are really small such as Prairie Fire, which would work on a windowsill. The chillies start off yellow and ripen to bright red.\"She notes that chillies are hungry, so will need potting on a lot more regularly than tomatoes, in fact every time the roots stick out of the bottom of the drainage holes, youll need to pot them on. And once flowers appear, feed them weekly, she advises.Top tip: \"Some ieties produce a king chilli, which is the first fruit which appears on the first axis of the plant. Take it off, otherwise it will prevent further flowering by concentrating a lot of the growth into this single fruit.\"Courgettes\"Put them out too early and you may get lots of male flowers when its cold, which will mean flowers and no courgettes, which is frustrating. The only thing to do is wait for it to warm up.\"Courgettes are big plants and people tend to put them slightly too close together. They really are better .-ft apart.\"Top tip: \"Keep picking them when they are small and they will keep producing. If you let them grow into marrows they start to think that the end of their days are coming and they wont produce so many.\"Sweetcorn\"If you havent sown it already, you can still sow sweetcorn in May, preferably indoors in pots. The minute theyve got to a good size - thicker than a pencil - get them in the ground when all danger of frost has passed.\"They are wind-pollinated, so you need to plant them in a block so that you raise the chances of the pollen hitting a neighbour. Plant them between - inches apart ideally. They dont need staking but keep them out of a direct wind tunnel.\"Sweetcorn are easy to grow but they will need a fairly good summer to produce good cobs.\"Top tip: \"If you think theyre getting rocked about too much, you can draw up the soil around the base.\"Eat What You Grow by Alys Fowler is published by Kyle Books, priced pound.

The kilt is made from one eight-yard stretch of material and the skill is chalking it so you know exactly where to put the pleats. The whole thing takes a skilled person about eight hours at least.The problem ndash and itrsquos the same with sporrans ndash is there are lots of cheap imports around, which has put the traditional craft under pressure. Kilt making by hand has now been added to the endangered list kept by the Heritage Crafts Association along with the likes of arrowsmithing, flintknapping, and lorinery. What it means is these wonderful traditions could disappear altogether.:Cummings paints surreal picture of goings-on at dysal Number  ndash Westminster sketchIn some ways though, it does seem strange that the threat to traditional kilt-making should come up now. The kilt has never been so ubiquitous, but maybe a lot of men think the lighter, cheaper kilt is easier to wear and lug about. The cost of a hand-made kilt can also be daunting ndash these days, you can easily pay more than pound,.The other problem with kilts is that,you do get one, it comes with a lot of baggage and attitude, some of which is a load of rubbish. For many, the kilt is the standardised vision of Scotland, but they werenrsquot always so common. My parents married in the s and it didnrsquot even cross my fatherrsquos mind to wear a kilt. I also spoke to the historian Patrick Watt about tartan and his experience was similar. Dr Watt, who was curator of modern history at the National Museum of Scotland, told me his dad did wear a kilt at his wedding in  but people asked what he was doing. ldquoLots of people wear kilts now, he said, ldquobut itrsquos a recent thing ndash in the last  years.No doubt, some of this recent enthusiasm for kilts has something to do with the recent enthusiasm for independence, the idea being that kilts are a link to national identity, rebellion or a form of modern-day Jacobitism. But all Irsquod say to that is: check your history. It may not be true, as some people think, that Highland dress was invented by Walter Scott, but the modern romantic image was popularised and spread by Queen Victoria. And check out this fact: at Culloden, there were kilted solders on both sides.Read more:Rosemary Goring: Battle royal looms as William and Kate deployed to bolster the UnionThe idea of clan tartans, which is also associated with kilts, is a modern obsession too, and an irritating one. Traditionally, people mixed and matched tartans, but now therersquos an idea that you should wear your clan tartan and,you donrsquot, a bumptious bore will tell you why you should. But why does the kilt have to be associated with ldquorules and cultural snobbery  Better to do your own thing .Finally, therersquos one other thing we should talk about, and itrsquos an issue most men are reluctant to discuss: sex and gender. I was at a ceilidh a while ago and the subject of men dressing ldquoas women came up, with most of the guys saying they were uncomfortable with the idea. I pointed out they were expressing this opinion while wearing skirts, to which their response was ldquothese arenrsquot skirts, these are kilts!That says it all, doesnrsquot it  We live in a society that says certain clothes are for women and certain clothes are for men many men also believe skirts are ldquowrong and kilts are ldquoright.

For operating an apartheid state where Arab Israelis do not have the same rights as Jewish Israelis. For turning Gaza into a refugee camp instead of allowing an independent Palestine state to flourish.Israel will never enjoy peace while it continues to oppress Palestinians.

Today, The Herald is launching an exciting and empowering new programme that aims to bring climate change discussion and solutions to iniduals and organisations everywhere ndash not just in this country, but around the world.Our Herald Climate Solutions initiative is linked with Climate Solutions Network, a pioneering new initiative developed by The Royal Scottish Geographical Society in association with the Institute of Directors , Universities of Stirling and Edinburgh and Jump Digital.This ground-breaking project offers two compelling courses allowing participants to learn about the climate crisis and how they can help to address it.One is the Climate Solutions Professional., which consists of four easy-to-follow web-based modules and an online workshop. It will help time-poor managers to understand climate issues and their relevance to their organisations and personal lives.The second is Climate Solutions Accelerator, an express online learning programme which teaches the basics in vital areas such as climate science and policy legislation and offers ideas around solutions in just  minutes.Both courses feature highly motivational materials as well as contributions from some of the worldrsquos leading figures in the fight against climate change.Those featured include global campaigner Greta Thunberg, former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, ex-Irish President Mary Robinson, former Norwegian Premier Gro Harlem Brundtland and recent UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.The programmes are the brainchild of Mike Robinson, CEO of the Perth-based Royal Scottish Geographical Society and a veteran climate change and sustainability campaigner.In  he helped found, and chaired, Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, the largest civil society coalition ever formed in this country.What drove him to launch this new programme  ldquoIt became obvious to me that far too many people still didnrsquot understand the relevance of climate change to their businesses and they didnrsquot have the time to sort that out, he explains. ldquoI realised I had built up a lot of knowledge in this area and that there wasnrsquot anything out there that could teach people what they could do.

We had already had about  people subscribe to it, including  in the Scottish Government.ldquoItrsquos aimed at people who are managers, directors or board members ndash anyone who wants to have a robust organisation. Wersquove got people signed up from a whole range of sectors and I think that is part of its appeal. The point is that climate change is now pervasive. It goes beyond the Sustainability Officer or a single department.ldquoItrsquos going to impact every aspect of organisations, so itrsquos really important that everyone from the board through to Finance Directors through to those in personnel, HR, purchasing and other areas has a better and more rounded understanding of where this is all going.ldquoWe do touch on the science, though that has been settled for quite a long time and we only tell people what they really need to know. Then therersquos another part that is about the inevitability of the direction of travel.ldquoPeople need to realise the ways things are going on this ndash the forthcoming COP conference in Glasgow later this year is a case in point. International commitments on climate change are ramping up year on year.The shorter, single session Climate Solutions Accelerator programme offers the basics in an easy-to-digest fashion. Several organisations have signed up to put their entire senior management, and in some cases their entire workforce, through one or other of the two courses. And this appeal is global.ldquoOne major US company enrolled some of its Scottish staff in an early session of the full course and quickly decided that the learning and knowledge gained needed to be rolled out to all its staff globally, more to follow on this. Wersquore getting a sense now that there is a really strong appetite for this sort of thing ndash businesses really want to understand the issues and get on top of them quickly.ldquoThe global names wersquove brought in on both of the programmes to help convey the message have helped with the content and to make it clear why people need to wake up to this issue.Although the courses are attracting interest worldwide,Mike Robinson says that they are unapologetically Scottish. ldquoCountries are at dferent points and therersquos no question that Scotland is well ahead of the rest of the world on this journey.ldquoNo-one is perfect in this, but the UK is the leading country on addressing climate issues in the G and Scotland is the leader within the UK, with much more stringent commitments than the other parts. That means that we have a responsibility, but there is also an opportunity for us in terms of leadership. Itrsquos about helping people understand the whole of the debate so they can be better informed and better prepared. I hope that by taking the courses, they will be better able to build change and deliver the future."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12647851.jpg?type=article-full","title":"build-knowledge-fairview-way-life-schools-open-day","story":"FOLLOWING months of challenges and disruptions, Fairview International School is delighted to offer families the ability to visit the establishment in person as part of an on-campus Open Day.The choice of education is an important choice for any parent to make and this decision-making process has been made much more dficult without the ability to experience the physical school environment throughout the recent period of restrictions in movement and social distancing.At this Bridge of Allan-based independent school, staff have worked hard with families and pupils to make the period of home schooling as undisruptive as possible.Head Teacher David Hicks said: ldquoOur in person Open Day allows you to come and experience our campus, taking in the beautul surrounding area of Bridge of Allan and beyond.ldquoBy attending, it also allows visiting students to fully immerse themselves in a student-centred, inquiry-focused lesson, engaged by the passion that flows through each of our wonderful teachersrsquo ways of teaching.ldquoThe structure of our open day allows both you and your child to learn about the IB Curriculum while your child also has the opportunity to join a lesson, whether that be a primary years based class or a middle years based class.ldquoBy attending in-person you will have the opportunity to meet with existing students and their parents to find out more about our school and the positive community ethos we have built.

However, I consider the fusion of fantasies which would emerge from the marriage would not be a strong alloy of allies but a tense hotchpotch of undefinable ad hoc policies.The Greens must realise that it was the Scottish public who voted for a devolved parliament and in  reaffirmed that it was a devolved and not an independent parliament they preferred. Are the Greens willing to hold democracy in such little value as the SNP displays I expect that both Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater, who lead the Greens in Scotland, are not so incredibly naive as to imagine they would have any meaningful future in an independent Scotlandthe controlling SNP has its way.

Their family have homes in Scotland.The Earls grandmother is head of state in Scotland and might remain so in the event of independence, so itrsquos nonsense to moan about the constitution in relation to this stravaig.The Earl and Countess are doing what the Queen and her representatives have always done, encouraging, participating, listening and helping. Itrsquos what those people are paid for. The Earlrsquos grandfather was appreciated for doing the like and was an energetic organiser of programmes of help and development.Itrsquos not necessary to be either a unionist or a monarchist to recognise that the Earl and Countess are doing their job with flair and engagement. If Ms Goringrsquos problem is one of institutional scale and cost, itrsquos worth mentioning that the royal brand earns millions for the Exchequer.Itrsquos perfectly legitimate to want a dferent kind of constitution.

We ask it to do remarkable things and it complies, usually immediately and uncomplainingly.Thatrsquos both a blessing and a curse. Computers and IT are simultaneously our best friend and an inhibitor to our advancement. We know things will happen when we click an app without ever really thinking about how it works or remembering that skilled people have worked to create and polish that app.This creates an assumption and an entitlement that acts as a barrier to learning when it comes to learning computer science. If youngsters in particular grow up with technology all around them, the thinking goes, then why should they feel the need to build that technology themselves Todayrsquos children are generallyregarded as what are known as lsquodigital nativesrsquo ndash young people who have grown up with computers and the internet as an integral part of their lives and as such, they are all comfortable and confident using these things.But the challenge is getting them to realise thatthey donrsquot develop a consciousness and a curiosity about the technology in their hands, itrsquos hard to convince them that they should consider a career in the science underlying it.To put it another way,someone is having a smooth ride in a modern car, they really donrsquot need to think about what is happening underneath the bonnet in the engine compartment. Therersquos an assumption because modern vehicles are so comfortable and reliable, we really no longer need mechanics. Until, of course, the car breaks down.When applied to computer science, this assumptive ethos is of concern to educators and in particular to Digital Xtra Fund, a Scotland-wide charity working to build interest in computing and technology among those aged  and under through extracurricular activities.Kraig Brown, the Fundrsquos Partnerships and Development Manager, believes this attitude is creating problems when it comes to getting students engaged in programmes such as the ones supported by his own organisation and others such as dressCode, which works to inspire Scottish girls to learn computing.ldquoThe term lsquodigital nativersquo implies that computer users donrsquot need to take computing science. It also assumes that they will automatically have the skills they need to enter the sort of tech-centric careers we are trying to encourage students into.ldquoThat might be the case for a minority, but it certainly isnrsquot for a majority. In fact, the phrase lsquodigital nativersquo diminishes the work that we do by suggesting the programmes we support for young people arenrsquot really needed.He adds: ldquoThey can go through school thinking that all they need to do is pick up an iPad and they can find everything they need on the internet.ldquoBut when they get beyond school and into university or an apprenticeship, they find they do need some computer science skills for a lot of careers in the world today ndash and not just tech-based roles. Once they realise they donrsquot have the necessary skills to get into many job markets, what do they do then  They can reskill or upskill but itrsquos much easierwe instil these computing skills earlier.Kraig makes the point that previous generations using popular early domestic computers such as the Commodore  or BBC Micro generally had to learn something about programming.ldquoYou had to know about computational thinking just to use them! Modern computers have eliminated that need. Thatrsquos good in many ways, it makes technology more accessible, but it also means many modern users donrsquot have those skills anymore.The declining numbers of computer science teachers in Scottish schools over the last  years hasnrsquot helped the situation. Even in , computer science is not taught in every secondary school.In the Highlands alone ndash an area nearly the size of Belgium ndash there are nine full-time Computer Science teachers covering  secondary schools. ldquoI think most senior leadership teams in schools appreciate how important the subject is by now, but because many donrsquot have the staff or resources, they canrsquot be as proactive in promoting the subject or getting their students as involved as they would like.Last yearrsquos Logan Review into education produced for the Scottish Government recommended that computer science should be treated as a core subject such as maths and physics.Kraig supports this, though he concedes the shortage of computing teachers will be an issue. ldquoThe challenges with computer science at the secondary level is negatively impacting a lot of young people in Scotland, eventhey donrsquot know it yet. I believe one solution is to aggressively upskill our primary teachers and introduce computing skills at an earlier stage to give them the foundational skills they need as well as excite them about the possibilities of tech.Recruiting more computer science teachers or introducing these skills earlier wonrsquot helpthere isnrsquot uptake from young people in secondary and beyond. How can the question of exciting students about building computing skills be successfully addressed  He believes the learning must be directly connected to real le.ldquoIn my opinion, the best way is to get industry involved ndash ideally young experts or professionals, but really anyone who can talk about their career, the skills they use, and how technology impacts this. So much of what we do in daily le is based on technology and the pandemic has only amplied this. It has also highlighted the growing importance of having technology and connectivity in place for all.Many people born before  have recently learned new digital skills as a matter of necessity. Kraig believes that the same kind of urgency and thinking is now required to inspire todayrsquos generation of young people to take the next steps to become digital creators and digital leaders, not simply lsquodigital nativesrsquo.www.digitalxtrafund.scot"},{"url":null,"title":"fmqs-sketch","story":"Having licked her chops after mocking Ruth Davidson all the way to the House of Lords, Nicola Sturgeon settled down to dine on her successor, Douglas Ross.However the new Scottish Tory leader proved a tougher beast than she might have hoped.He began by listing multiple moans from businesses struggling under the extended lockdown in Glasgow, Ms Sturgeonrsquos home turf.The First Minister understood the frustration of businesses, but you know, Covid eh  What can you do At least she wasnt Boris Johnson, the Prime Muppet who Dominic Cummings napalmed on live TV.\"It is sometimes necessary for people such as me in leadership positions [ie not you Dougie] to take very quick decisions,\" she said.\"It is often the failure to take quick and firm decisions that leads to loss of le.

Simply telling the Scottish Government and other devolved administrations what UK ministers have already decided unilaterally doesnrsquot qualy as engagement in any meaningful sense.copy -.

Art can offer the viewer a door into another way of looking at our world, and that’s why “I’m looking forward to seeing the entries for this year’s competition, to see what excites people about the future of Northern Ireland.” Sara McCracken, RSPB NI’s Head of Fundraising and Communications commented, “Throughout history some of the biggest changes have been brought about by a small group of passionate people, from civil rights to votes for women, including the start of the RSPB itself. “Over the years, artists have explored and documented history and politics to huge effect, the nature and climate emergency is the defining issue of our time, this is your chance to have your say and canvas for nature.” Curator of TEDxStormont, Eva Grosman, added, “At TEDx we passionately believe in the power of ideas to inspire, change attitudes, lives and ultimately the world. “The Countdown initiative is the perfect opportunity for Northern Ireland’s climate change experts and environmental leaders to discuss ideas for change.

These have included its County Antrim congregations in its Route, Ballymena, Carrickfergus and Templepatrick presbyteries. Called ‘Fanning the flame’, the initiative is part of PCI’s Refined series of resources that it has developed throughout the pandemic to support and develop ongoing congregational le. Explaining the rationale for the series, Rev David Thompson, Secretary for the Council for Congregational Le and Witness , who organised the sessions, said that it was important for congregations to retain flexibility for the road ahead.“Since the start of the pandemic, it has been an extraordinarily dficult time for everyone. “For our congregations in Northern Ireland, it has been a very stop – start journey. “Thankfully it does feel like we are turning a corner and entering a moment of greater hope, optimism and opportunity, but it won’t be without its challenges.”The title for the series comes from  Timothy :-, which says, “For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gt of God [...] For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline. Key leaders from each congregation in Northern Ireland, including those across County Antrim, were encouraged to participate.David Thompson said that he was pleased that each presbytery has responded positively to the Moderator’s invitation to be part of the programme. “Timing is key in building progress and trying to do so too early may lead to frustration. “Leaving it too late, may mean we miss an important moment. This is why we began with our northern presbyteries this month, with events for congregations in our southern presbyteries taking place in June, which seems about right given their setting and circumstances,” David Thompson said.Running the events has involved a signicant leap of faith and rapid learning by staff in how to harness the potential of digital technology and presentation. Lynne Herbison’ PCI’s Programme Development Officer added, “The team involved have learned a lot and those new skills will be invaluable in opening up a world of possibility in how we can now engage with congregations and their members in the future. “Nothing compares to being physically together, but we hope our digital  will be able to supplement that and improve the reach of what we can offer to our churches and their members.”Presbyterian Moderator, Right Reverend Dr David Bruce, who took part in the events, said, “This has been a massive undertaking, delivered in a very short window so as not to miss this crucial moment as we continue to turn this long awaited corner.“ I really want to commend everyone who has made this important series possible.“We have been through exceptionally challenging times and I don’t want to minimise that and the suffering that this pandemic has caused. In my contributions to each event, looking at how congregations can begin to move forward, I tried to convey a sense that change often forces reinvention and reconsideration, opening up new pathways and patterns that overlay the old familiar foundations of church le that we cherish. “Exploring this, I am looking forward to welcoming our Republic of Ireland presbyteries to ‘Fanning the Flame’ in June.” he said.Dr Bruce concluded by saying, “In the long history of God’s people there have been many times like the months we have experienced, and in those dark days God was at work, and He is today. “It is my earnest prayer that we will see tangible signs of His leading, so that we can press on with confidence into this new beginning.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1622208073289.jpg--covid_19___fri_28th_may_figures.jpg?1622208073000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20210528newscovid 19 fri 28th may figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows No further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

Destinations include Portugal, Israel, Iceland, Australia and New Zealand.However, today’s poll reveals many are still deeply reluctant to hop on a plane abroad any time soon.People were asked, once vaccinated, when they would consider a foreign holiday.Just % said they plan to head away in  — % may travel this summer while another % would consider an overseas trip later in the year.The vast majority , said it would be next year before they think about going abroad.Another % said it would be two or three years before a trip outside the UK or Ireland, while % have no plans to go overseas at any point.The remaining % were unsure or had no firm opinion.Fewer older people are willing to consider overseas travel this year. Just % would consider doing so — % this summer and % at any point this year. More than halfsaid it would be next year before they consider jetting off, while % would leave it two or three years.By contrast, almost halfof  to  year olds are considering heading overseas this year — with % hoping to get away in the next few months and % later in the year.

Another % said it would be next year.However, just over a quarter of females plan to holiday abroad in  — % this summer and % this year. Some % plan to leave trips to .It comes as a public health expert from Belfast warned against summer holidays — despite the traffic light system for foreign travel.Professor Gabriel Scally told holidaymakers to “beware” and also warned it is “irresponsible” to travel to other countries while potentially infected with a dangerous iant.Prof Scally, a member of independent Sage, said: “The regional director of the World Health Organization in Europe issued a statement in the last couple of days saying there shouldn’t be international travel and I would agree with that.“It is undesirable to have people holidaying in international resorts at this time for all sorts of reasons.“It isn’t necessarily safe to travel on airplanes, there was a flight between India and Hong Kong and there were  infections and they were only picked up because of quarantine in Hong Kong.“Flights are dficult, but it isn’t just the flights, it’s what happens at arrivals and departures with queues of people in restricted spaces.“You also have lots of people from dferent countries mixing together at foreign resorts.“If you think back a year, the virus came to the UK and Republic of Ireland by people ing from holidays.”He continued: “It’s important to remember that the vaccine isn’t the cure all.“There’s always the risk posed by iants and it’s irresponsible to go off to another country and potentially take a dangerous iant with you.”Prof Scally also criticised the traffic light system, saying: “We need a proper managed quarantine system for everyone arriving into the country.”The Department of Health and the Executive were contacted for comment.Yesterday an airline industry chief said people who have received both doses of the Covid- vaccine should not face restrictions when travelling to countries on the Government’s amber list.Willie Walsh, director-general of airline body Iata, said people should be allowed to make up their own minds about the risks of travelling to amber list destinationsthey have received their jabs.Those ing from countries on the Government’s amber list must quarantine at home for  days and take pre-departure and post-arrival tests.But Mr Walsh, who is the former chief executive of IAG — the parent company of British Airways — said amber restrictions should be the same as those for green list countries for fully vaccinated passengers.He told the Mail on Sunday: “People were promised the benefit of being vaccinated — a vaccine idend — and they should be given it.“I thinkyou’ve had both shots then there’s no argument you can make to say those restrictions can remain in place, and people should be free to decide for themselvesthey see any risk in travelling to a green or amber country,” the former IAG chief executive added.Most ReadDUP turmoil: Resignations, walk outs and heated exchanges after #ding dong# leadership meeting but Poots insists party not idedFoster can leave at ‘time of her choosing’ says Poots as police confirm probe into bullying and UDA intimidation claimsI don#t think he#s laughing now: Christian Jessen to pay record damages over Arlene Foster  tweetPoots stays tight-lipped on whether he’d accept Mass inviteHome comforts… ‘lestyle’ store opens in Belfast in £m investmentTop VideosPlayDUP turmoil: Poots insists party isn#t idedPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#PlayEdwin Poots full speech as he is ratied new leader of the DUPLatest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageCoronavirus QA: Everything you need to know as vaccination programme opens to all adultsNearly  payments issued under £k Covid grant scheme ineligibleCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths, fewer than  cases and vaccine programme extended£m to be paid out to NI businesses that managed to remain open during lockdownLatestGary Lineker stepping down as BT Sport host and plans to follow Foxes in Europe‘Hope, excitement and relief’ as Ireland prepares for extensive reopeningHenry Slade claries comments over refusing to take coronavirus vaccineGary Lineker to step down as BT Sport’s Champions League presenterBill Cosby denied parole after refusing to engage in sex offender programmes,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurney PAAndrew MaddenTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailMore than half of people in Northern Ireland believe parents should have the right to refuse a Covid vaccine for their children, our poll shows.The news comes after Northern Ireland’s vaccine roll-out opened to those aged  to  and a raft of Covid restrictions are lted from Monday.“This has been made possible because of the success of the vaccination programme and the majority of people acting on the public health advice,” Health Minister Robin Swann said.According to the Belfast -LucidTalk poll, % of respondents felt parents should be able to refuse a vaccine for their children, while % felt they should not and % said they did not know, were not sure or had no opinion.The figures, however, y depending on the age and religious make-up of those who took part in the poll.Regarding  to  year-olds, a majorityfelt parents should not be able to turn down a vaccine for their children, while % felt they should and % didn’t know or had no opinion.Those aged  to , on the other hand, had starkly contrasting views. Some % said parents should be able to refuse a vaccine for their children and % said they should not. And % said they didn’t know, were unsure or had no opinion.Vaccines may be refused for a iety of reasons. For instance, earlier this year several countries temporarily halted the roll-out of the AstraZeneca jab due to concerns of rare blood clots.Due to evidence suggesting that younger people may be at greater risk of the extremely rare clots associated with the AstaZeneca vaccine, those in this age group can choose which vaccine to receive.The latest advice states that anyone under  can book a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, or they can make what the Department of Health has described as an “informed decision” and get the AstraZeneca jab at Belfast’s SSE Arena or at participating community pharmacies.More than one million people in Northern Ireland have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine to date.Looking at the religious make-up of those who took part in the poll, it is apparent that Protestants are more likely to feel parents should have a say over vaccinating their children than when compared to Catholics.Some % of Protestant respondents felt this way, while % felt they should not have the right to turn down a jab for their children and % had no opinion, were not sure or didn’t know.Of those designating as Catholic, % felt they should have the right to turn down a vaccine for their children and % did not. The remaining % said they didn’t know or were unsure.In terms of those of no religion, % were in favour of parents having this right and % did not. Some % weren’t sure or had no opinion on the matter.On Sunday the Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride urged everyone to get vaccinated. He said: “A Public Health England study has found the vaccines are highly effective. This underlines the need for people to come forward for their first and second doses as soon as they are available.”Most ReadDUP turmoil: Resignations, walk outs and heated exchanges after #ding dong# leadership meeting but Poots insists party not idedFoster can leave at ‘time of her choosing’ says Poots as police confirm probe into bullying and UDA intimidation claimsI don#t think he#s laughing now: Christian Jessen to pay record damages over Arlene Foster  tweetPoots stays tight-lipped on whether he’d accept Mass inviteHome comforts… ‘lestyle’ store opens in Belfast in £m investmentTop VideosPlayDUP turmoil: Poots insists party isn#t idedPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#PlayEdwin Poots full speech as he is ratied new leader of the DUPLatest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageCoronavirus QA: Everything you need to know as vaccination programme opens to all adultsNearly  payments issued under £k Covid grant scheme ineligibleCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths, fewer than  cases and vaccine programme extended£m to be paid out to NI businesses that managed to remain open during lockdownLatestGary Lineker stepping down as BT Sport host and plans to follow Foxes in Europe‘Hope, excitement and relief’ as Ireland prepares for extensive reopeningHenry Slade claries comments over refusing to take coronavirus vaccineGary Lineker to step down as BT Sport’s Champions League presenterBill Cosby denied parole after refusing to engage in sex offender programmes,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo: Stephen HendersonStephen Henderson, photographer FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe image captured by Stephen Henderson. Photo: Stephen HendersonEimear McGovernTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA Belfast photographer said he was “over the moon” after capturing a widely-shared photo of a stunning lunar display seen across Northern Ireland on Wednesday night.Stephen Henderson stood in the cold for more than three hours to capture a supermoon that was “bigger, brighter and definitely redder than usual” at Scrabo Tower in Newtownards.A supermoon is a full or “new” moon that appears when the moon is closest to the Earth in its orbit, meaning the moon usually appears about % bigger and % brighter.The May supermoon coincided with a lunar eclipse which saw the moon turn red but that was only visible in parts of the world including South America, Australia and South-East Asia.He planned for several weeks to capture the shots but said a bit of luck also allowed him to take the picture.Mr Henderson , who previously worked as a sports photographer, said he had a few moments of panic when he worried that he hadn’t picked the right spot on a long road which he had scouted out in previous days to capture the moon in “exactly the right spot”.The moon first rose in red and then turned pink shortly after pm to allow Mr Henderson to get the shot.“I was phoning other photographers to ask them when the moon was rising because the hill was in the way of me seeing it,” he told the Belfast .“I couldn’t see anything until others started sharing photos and videos. Then I was able to walk down the road and get the moon in exactly the right position.”Mr Henderson said he walked around to find the right spot from which to take his shots. “The nice thing about moon photography is thatI move left or right, it moves the moon left or right of the subject. I can move it by walking down the street a few hundred metres.“People think it’s photoshopped or it can’t be done, but you can explain the terminology and the method and then they say “fair play to you”.

This party is always described as a bit of a family party and sometimes in your family you have a bit of a ding dong and there was probably a bit of a ding dong, but we#ll pull together, Mr Paisley said.East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson also denied there were isions within the party.People had an opportunity to say, they said it very forthrightly and it was all very amicable at the end of the day and a decision was made, he said.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePress Eye - Belfast - Northern Ireland - th May  Edwin Poots pictured at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Belfast where the ruling executive of the Democratic Unionist Party are meeting to raty Edwin Poots as the party’s new leader.

He said the remarks had caused “huge offence”.Mr Poots later denied his remarks were sectarian, saying they could not be because “most Sinn Fein leaders don’t attend the Catholic Church on a regular basis”..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadDUP turmoil: Resignations, walk outs and heated exchanges after #ding dong# leadership meeting but Poots insists party not idedFoster can leave at ‘time of her choosing’ says Poots as police confirm probe into bullying and UDA intimidation claimsI don#t think he#s laughing now: Christian Jessen to pay record damages over Arlene Foster  tweetPoots stays tight-lipped on whether he’d accept Mass inviteHome comforts… ‘lestyle’ store opens in Belfast in £m investmentTop VideosPlayDUP turmoil: Poots insists party isn#t idedPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#PlayEdwin Poots full speech as he is ratied new leader of the DUPLatest Northern Ireland‘Hope, excitement and relief’ as Ireland prepares for extensive reopeningPolice investigating claims of intimidation during DUP leadership contestRepresenting Northern Ireland ‘greatest privilege of my le’ – Arlene FosterJon TongeOpinionThere’s no disloyalty in UUP ranks, but Beattie badly needs some new recruitsFoster to step aside next TuesdayPoots names new front benchLatestGary Lineker stepping down as BT Sport host and plans to follow Foxes in Europe‘Hope, excitement and relief’ as Ireland prepares for extensive reopeningHenry Slade claries comments over refusing to take coronavirus vaccineGary Lineker to step down as BT Sport’s Champions League presenterBill Cosby denied parole after refusing to engage in sex offender programmes,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

End to end swashbuckling football that turns the stomach inside out. Slaughtneils shoot-out with Kilcar in Omagh a few seasons back. Derrys win over Dublin in the  All-Ireland semi-final. Armagh and Kerrys blockbuster in the  All-Ireland Final are some that instantly jump onto this page. But championship is about so much more. It is about character and pulling a result from somewhere, like a rabbit from a hat. I think about Dungivens Ulster winning team of . Their performance against Errigal Ciaran that day in Clones was brilliant. It was a convincing win, but they nearly didnt get out of the first round of the championship in Derry that year. googletag.cmd.push In two nerve-tangling encounters at Drumsurn, they escaped from Glenullins clutches on the seat of their pants. Ruairi Boylans - nearly toppled them in the drawn game, before coming through by a point in a replay, their lowest winning margin of the season, second only to a two-point Ulster semi-final over St Pauls of Belfast. There are many others down the years, but when I think about the term championship team those two games in Drumsurn rush to the forefront of my mind. A team finding a way to win, Glenullin dying with their boots on. Chatting to Mark Lynch for a piece on Derrys encounters with Longford got me thinking. Are Derry really a qualier team  googletag.cmd.push More often than not, it was a sorry story from the house of pain. Before the qualiers began in , Derry were on the wrong end of two massive refereeing decisions. Henry Downeys perfectly time shoulder charge on Paddy McKeever yielded a free in as their Ulster semi-final with Armagh sat in the mixer, with the Orchard County going on to win the first of two Ulster titles. Then,  months later, they got another soft free – with BBC commentator and former Armagh legend Jimmy Smyth admitting as much on commentary – to go ahead before Anthony missed a chance to level the game from a free well outside the .     Sting through the championship records, I start to wonder how the mental scars couldve affected the county as a whole. Derrys runs to the All-Ireland Qualiers yielded the  tilt at Sam, only for running out of diesel coming down the final furlong of the infamous semi-final and Galways Matthew Clancy delivering a hammer blow. As the years went past, the challenge dwindled. The  season ended in a comprehensive enough defeat to Kerry in the semi-final. There was the high-octane battle against the Dubs in the  Quarter-Final and the defeat to Tipperary in the last- clash in Breffni in . Outside of that, Derrys championship record of the last  years is a reality check. Of the  championship games, there were  wins,  defeats and a sole draw, against Tyrone in , Mickey Hartes first game in charge. Derry have played  qualier games, winning . Of the  defeats, three were after extra time and the only extra time win was over Cavan in  at Celtic Park. Of the  victories, only the  win over Mayo and a one-point win over Armagh the same year jump out as scalps. The win over Monaghan in Clones two years later was of note. The rest, on paper, were games Derry were favourites in, including three wins from four against Cavan – the only county Derry havent faced over the last two decades in the Ulster championship. Then you have the Longford story with one win in four games. Add in two wins from four against Laois, another team Derry would fancy beating. In Ulster, Derry have won just  times in  games, with that one draw thrown in. On the face of it, the result looks grim, but scratch the surface and  of those games were against either Donegal or Tyrone. Of that,  were in the first round. The  win, under the baking sun in Ballybofey, was Derrys only win over Donegal in eight attempts. Of the eight clashes with Tyrone, the famous  win in Omagh, when the Red Hands were All-Ireland champions, is the only victory. In fairness, thats a tough series of draws. Five of the defeats to Donegal came in an era when they were jostling in the pecking order behind Dublin. The same can be said for Tyrone. But Glenullin wouldve been fair from Ulster club contenders in , yet couldve dumped Dungiven out on their ear. A team with the McKeevers, Brolly, McGilligan, goalkeeper Eoin McCloskey and rising star Paul Murphy. As Derry go into this years Ulster championship, they search for a first win in the competition since  and there is a decent chance it will be Donegal again. From looking back at the championship records, it changes the attitude on where Derry currently sit. Yes, there is a lot of talent coming along, but there is nothing that breeds growth like winning games. And especially when against the odds. I think back to Castlebar in . After being relegated from Division  and shipping a hammering by Tyrone in Ulster, Derry were seconds away from turning Mayo over. Conor Loftus bagged a goal to change the game and Derry went out with a whimper after extra-time. Two years later, in the Ulster championship opener in Omagh, Derry had Tyrone momentarily on the ropes. But after Shane McGuigans goal, they needed to attack the jugular even more. Darren McCurry had the ball in the net a matter of seconds later, as Tyrone outscored Derry - to -. Then there was last years game with Armagh. If Derry had got anything out of the first ten minutes, when they were all at sea, theyd have had a brilliant chance of victory. Thats three games and three massive uses of the word , but thats where Derrys future lies. Speaking before the start of this season, manager Rory Gallagher highlighted how Derry, in recent years, failed to win games that mattered. He mentioned championship and key relegation or promotion games. The manner of both league wins so far point to a team that can have a real cut at the Ulster championship on the other side of battling for promotion. Derry need to replicate Dungiven from that night in Drumsurn, in the  championship. By hook or by crook, find a way of turning performances into results.

Devine is the current Motorsport Ireland International Driver of the Year and is looking forward to ato the ERC series where he has produced a number of eye catching drives since he took a debut podium on Rally Hungary in . “I can’t wait to get my ERC season up and running,” Devine commented. We’ve got some testing under our belt in the new car and it feels really good, but there’s nothing better than actual competition to see where you’re at. googletag.cmd.push Rally Poland will be a new event to me as it didn’t run last year so we are going to do Rally Žemaitija in Lithuania as a warm up beforehand to get up to speed. Last year’s ERC campaign didn’t get off to a good start but we finished well and I’m hoping to take that momentum into . It takes a lot of backing to mount a challenge at this level and I’m delighted to welcome some new partners on board this season including Parts For Cars, Lyons of Limerick, Rentokil Initial, Trailerstuff.ie and Fire Protection Ireland. Without them and existing backers like Curran Gate, Pirelli, TST Transport, EARS Motorsport, Marina Racewear and the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy, this season just wouldn’t be possible.” googletag.cmd.push The move to a Ford will see Callumto a brand he’s rallied with before and M-Sport will be keeping a watchful eye on Callum’s progress this season.“The European Rally Championship has long been a proving ground for young talent looking to make their mark on the world stage, and it’s great to see another young driver choosing to take this route with the Fiesta. saidM-Sport Managing Director, Malcolm Wilson OBE. We’ve been aware of Callum for a number of years now following strong performances with the Fiesta R in Junior WRC and Fiesta R in Ireland. He’s got talent, and I’m keen to see what he can do as he tackles some ofEurope’s most famous events with the Fiesta Rally.”     M-Sport Ford Team Principal, Richard Millener added: “It’s great to see Callum back behind the wheel of the Fiesta and I’m looking forward to seeing what he can do this year. He had a great season with the Fiesta in , finishing third overall in the Irish Tarmac Championship and securing his first victory in Donegal – and we’re all keen to see him carry those performances onto the European stage. He’s already completed one year at this level, and now that he’s reunited with the Fiesta we want to help him take that next step. He’s got the initial experience under his belt, and we will give him as much support as we can to allow him to excel. The competition will be strong, but Callum is a very determined and talented young driver with the potential to surprise a few people this year.” Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy driver Devine will be joined for his ERC adventure by co-driver James Fulton and the Championship will consist of eight rounds taking place in Poland, Latvia, Italy, the Czech Republic, the Azores, Portugal, Hungary and Gran Canarias.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Devine is the current Motorsport Ireland International Driver of the Year and is looking forward to ato the ERC series where he has produced a number of eye catching drives since he took a debut podium on Rally Hungary in . “I can’t wait to get my ERC season up and running,” Devine commented. We’ve got some testing under our belt in the new car and it feels really good, but there’s nothing better than actual competition to see where you’re at. googletag.cmd.push Rally Poland will be a new event to me as it didn’t run last year so we are going to do Rally Žemaitija in Lithuania as a warm up beforehand to get up to speed. Last year’s ERC campaign didn’t get off to a good start but we finished well and I’m hoping to take that momentum into . It takes a lot of backing to mount a challenge at this level and I’m delighted to welcome some new partners on board this season including Parts For Cars, Lyons of Limerick, Rentokil Initial, Trailerstuff.ie and Fire Protection Ireland. Without them and existing backers like Curran Gate, Pirelli, TST Transport, EARS Motorsport, Marina Racewear and the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy, this season just wouldn’t be possible.” googletag.cmd.push The move to a Ford will see Callumto a brand he’s rallied with before and M-Sport will be keeping a watchful eye on Callum’s progress this season.“The European Rally Championship has long been a proving ground for young talent looking to make their mark on the world stage, and it’s great to see another young driver choosing to take this route with the Fiesta. saidM-Sport Managing Director, Malcolm Wilson OBE. We’ve been aware of Callum for a number of years now following strong performances with the Fiesta R in Junior WRC and Fiesta R in Ireland. He’s got talent, and I’m keen to see what he can do as he tackles some ofEurope’s most famous events with the Fiesta Rally.”     M-Sport Ford Team Principal, Richard Millener added: “It’s great to see Callum back behind the wheel of the Fiesta and I’m looking forward to seeing what he can do this year. He had a great season with the Fiesta in , finishing third overall in the Irish Tarmac Championship and securing his first victory in Donegal – and we’re all keen to see him carry those performances onto the European stage. He’s already completed one year at this level, and now that he’s reunited with the Fiesta we want to help him take that next step. He’s got the initial experience under his belt, and we will give him as much support as we can to allow him to excel. The competition will be strong, but Callum is a very determined and talented young driver with the potential to surprise a few people this year.” Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy driver Devine will be joined for his ERC adventure by co-driver James Fulton and the Championship will consist of eight rounds taking place in Poland, Latvia, Italy, the Czech Republic, the Azores, Portugal, Hungary and Gran Canarias.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He waves a cursory greeting and continues on his way. In the time it takes me to gather everything I need together, he passes me again, his step count no doubt rising with every lap of the town. Zoom. Walk. Laptop. Bake. Netflix. Repetition has become endemic over the last year, but its something Moneymore cant be accused of. There is a unique feel to the fronts of the buildings that greet me as I walk around the town. Even the post office, now boarded up, remains unbranded. googletag.cmd.push Moneymores terrain gives the town a layered effect. The pillared entrance of The Manor House provides the backdrop to the towns mini roundabout, welcoming motorists coming down the hill from Smith Street. Rusty scaffolding frames a construction site on my left as I make my way down. A woman waters potted plants in her compact front garden. The distinctive smell of curry is emanating from the two Chinese restaurants at the bottom of the hill. Shutters are down on Antonios pizza, yet to open for the day. More scaffolding sits alongside buildings in mid-construction off High Street, but no work appears to be going on today. googletag.cmd.push Along Lawford Street there are ersion signs in place as Council staff busy themselves in resurfacing the Turnaface Road. The grating sound of the road roller echoes off the houses that line the street leading back to the town centre. You could describe Moneymore as ornate. Older, unique buildings, set at dferent levels, create a layered backdrop, crowned by the spire of St John and St Treas church on the top of the hill.  The hum of a small aircraft passing overhead and the unmistakable smell of freshly-cut grass adds to the sense of a town taking new-found pleasure in the mundane.     A pregnant sky threatens rain. Taken a dip I nip into The Mane Barber Shop, where a neon sign declares the shop open for business. Owner Pauline McGarvey is at her lunch. She says reopening has not been the silver bullet the industry was hoping for. “This week has been terrible. For the first seven days [after reopening] it was great, but its taken a dip again,” she tells me. “The older folk that keep you going – your pensioners and farmers and that during the day – they havent been about the same. A vintage tractor model welcomes visitors to the town from the Tyrone side. “It was a gamble coming into a small town. You do have a bit of passing trade but youre hoping people are going to come in from the likes of Coagh, Lissan and Loup. “I said I would give it six months and see how it turns. Its fine, but its not busy. You have that fear of whether its going to come back.” Pauline has been in Moneymore three years, and until the pandemic ruthlessly attacked all businesses, things had been going well.  has seen a seismic change across all industries, driving many hair and beauty professionals off the high street altogether. “Lots of people are working from home and I have to admit, Im tempted,” she says. “Youre still going to be hit with rates, and you havent stopped paying your water bill, your electricity, your rent. “Yes, we got a bit of help, butyouve no customers in, then that money is all going to go and you still have to find wages too. “Ive seen a lot of hair and beauty people who havent gone back from the first lockdown.” Humanity adapts though, and over the last year, Pauline has embraced the situation in which the world found itself. She got married in February, and has enjoyed the extra time with her family. Keeping an eye on litter in the area. “It was the first time in my le I could actually say I was a mummy. I loved spending time with the weans,” she says. “It felt like wed a whole  years wrapped into one year. It is nice getting back though, you need the routine. Its bittersweet in a way.” Cookstown native Pauline says lockdown has really hit young people in the area hard. Her daughter, Danielle, is in Year , her entire GCSE years undertaken amid a worldwide health crisis. “Even she says she could do with another year at school,” she says. “Theyve missed a full year of preparation for the next step. Theyve been living alone in their bedroom. No formal, nothing. They werent even in school to plan it.” Its a quiet day in the barber shop, on what would normally be a busy Friday afternoon, with people popping in ahead of their weekend plans. There would have been excited chatter, the buzz of anticipation. Last minute changes of plan. Maybe even a wee drink. A look at her schedule confirms a gap of a few hours until Paulines next appointment. Without that steady flow of customers, the day can be long, lonely even. Welcome to Moneymore. Company is a two way street, and the dynamic of conversation, service and industry has been greatly missed by both barber and customer. “Even the most bald man that I have is in here every week,” says Pauline. “Two seconds would do it, but you would stretch it out to ten or  minutes, just because he likes coming in for the company. “Sometimes its just nice to get sitting down and get it done for you. Even though I have good faithful customers, I was nervous and jittery the first day back. “The amount of people who are saying its great to see you back, it gives you that wee glow. It would be nice to see a boom in Moneymore again. “I dont think anybody is going to feel anything dferent. Were all just going with the flow and trying not to stress and worry. “I think youre just going to have to wipe this year out the same as last year.”  The indicators that marked the early, panic-stricken days of the pandemic – the empty streets, closed schools, empty supermarket shelves – have long faded into memory. Only the window dressing remains. Sanitisers at shop doors. Face masks in shops. The odd discarded rubber glove on the street. All three car dealerships on the Magherafelt Road are dotted with customers as I drive past on the way home. The petrol station forecourt is hiving with people. By next Monday, theof indoor hospitality will mark another signicant step on the road to recovery. On the way out of the town, I spot a familiar cowboy hat bobbing up and down at the road side. A man enjoying his rediscovered freedom on the fringes of the Sperrins.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After crossing the bridge, I head up the hill and pull the car in opposite the Vivo and the magnicently named Rio Grande bar. Parks Rio Grande, the Faughan River, flows through the centre of the village, which this afternoon sits under an angry-looking sky. A woman walks her dog down Learmount Road, her face set against the stf breeze that is swishing through the trees surrounding the village. The scene on Learmount Road leading up the hill. Rain starts to fall as a mother guides her toddler out the doors of the Vivo, one hand clutching hers and the other gripping the bottle of juice he has just been bought. googletag.cmd.push A large plastic ice cream cone sits hopefully outside the shop. Up the hill comes a learner driver seemingly on a lesson. She stops outside Learmount Resource Centre and disappears into the building, before emerging with her child in tow to resume her lesson. A delivery driver pulls into the yard of Devine Kitchens. He s to his cab and pulls out a hammer. Things must be getting serious. As I cross the bridge, I spot the wheel from an old watermill by the river side, almost reclaimed by its surroundings. A remnant of an  flax mill known as Quigleys Mill. googletag.cmd.push Perhaps the most clear view of the mill is from the top of the hill outside Park Hardware and DIY. Greg McElhinney and Matthew Devine. Inside, owner Greg McElhinney says the last year has been busy. “With construction and everything  closing down last April, we were very busy, which was good for us because people from the local area were able to do home projects,” he tells me. “The weather was good as well, so youd a lot of painting and decorating – fences and gardens and stuff like that – going on. “People were happy there was a local business still operating, because a lot of the bigger hardware stores had closed.     “It got to the stage when it was hard to source materials because suppliers were closed until June time, but people were happy enough to occupy their time. They had nothing  to do.” The remains of Quigleys Mill, Park. Parks postal area recorded an increase in Covid cases last week, and despite the attachment to Derry city skewing the numbers, Greg admits there is still a degree of worry locally. “The majority of the population feel we still have to be serious about this. Its drilled into everybody at this stage, like putting your seatbelt on in the car,” he says. “The worry now is were straddling the Donegal border to a certain extent and case numbers are very high either side of it. “There is more positivity now than there was maybe six weeks ago though. Society is opening up again, and the vaccinations are a positive thing.” Covid has taken its toll on rural le too, and compliance with regulations has come at a social cost for village communities. “Where were based is very much a rural area, with a lot of the farming community and tradesmen and stuff,” says Greg. “You get some people who, by chance, meet up outside the shop here and have an opportunity to have a chat that maybe havent seen each other in a few months. “Those guys would have been at markets or farm meets every week, or pubs, but now you see them sitting out there for half an hour chatting to each other. “The social aspect, face to face, is the biggest thing. “The local community group have done a lot of work with the walkways there over the past number of years, which is very good.” Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty from Learmount Community Development Group. The local community group to which Greg refers is Learmount Community Development Group, which is nestled down a lane next to the entrance to Learmount Forest. Over the last year, Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty have noticed a big increase in people using Parks hidden gem. “We would have come down here some mornings and that car park would be full,” says Caroline. “Our secret Learmount Forest isnt a secret any more, and thats great, because everybody wants out, and weve had drop-ins coming from that.” “The forest has been fantastic for people being able to get out and safely meet their neighbours,” adds Catriona. “Theyll maybe call in at quiet times to have a socially distanced cup of tea. That social aspect has been missed, they are missing company and casual conversation.” Caroline feels the experience of the last year has sharpened focus on the issue of loneliness that had been hiding in plain sight. “We had a man who lives alone and had been sick for two or three days,” she says. “He hadnt been out and had no food in the house, so thankfully we were able to help with that. “You just know people are lonely and looking to get out again, but at the same time are a bit anxious about it. “Theyre happy to take the summer out of it and see what happens. There is certainly a lot of loneliness, isolation and depression though. “You could obviously be in the middle of a housing site and still be lonely, but when you see some of the people on their own, up a lane, they see nobody. They barely even see the postman now.” Working with both young and old people, the group have seen the effect the pandemic and its associated lockdowns have had on both generations.  “A lot of our work is with older people, and whilst theyre saying theyre fed up, some of them are getting a wee bit set in their ways,” says Caroline. “You just know by talking to them. We had a woman who always came in every week, even when it was bad, and she hasnt been in about two months. “Its highlighted how much we miss the social side of things, not being able to get out and meet friends. Even for the youth. “People always think all they need is their phone, because thats all theyre sitting on, but you can see now how the youth are crying out as much for social contact as any other generation.” There is hope though, that with the vaccines roll out and the upcoming warmer weather, that the group will be able to run some of their usual summer events. “We are looking at putting together a summer programme, but wed be a bit nervous ourselves about bringing a group of people into the room,” says Caroline.  “It would be perfectthere was good weather, because it will be planned outdoors. If the weather is bad, well take it over to Park hall, because its a bit bigger than here. “We have funding for dancing and music, which I think people would love to hear. Wed love to have tables out there on a nice evening, with a bit of a barbecue and a bit of music. “Youd like to think by September, we should be able to get going.” On the way back through the village, the shutters are half up on the Rio Grande as preparations continue inside. By the time you read this it will have reopened its doors. Hospitality has ed throughout the county, another step on the road to recovery. The farmers outside Greg McElhinneys store now have somewhere  to shoot the breeze. For the next few weeks at least, Covid fears will be drowned out by clink of glasses, the audible relief of the repressed socialite and the laughter of friends reunited. Dancing, however, is still prohibited under the regulations. It may need to be done across Parks Rio Grande, rather than inside it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After crossing the bridge, I head up the hill and pull the car in opposite the Vivo and the magnicently named Rio Grande bar. Parks Rio Grande, the Faughan River, flows through the centre of the village, which this afternoon sits under an angry-looking sky. A woman walks her dog down Learmount Road, her face set against the stf breeze that is swishing through the trees surrounding the village. The scene on Learmount Road leading up the hill. Rain starts to fall as a mother guides her toddler out the doors of the Vivo, one hand clutching hers and the other gripping the bottle of juice he has just been bought. googletag.cmd.push A large plastic ice cream cone sits hopefully outside the shop. Up the hill comes a learner driver seemingly on a lesson. She stops outside Learmount Resource Centre and disappears into the building, before emerging with her child in tow to resume her lesson. A delivery driver pulls into the yard of Devine Kitchens. He s to his cab and pulls out a hammer. Things must be getting serious. As I cross the bridge, I spot the wheel from an old watermill by the river side, almost reclaimed by its surroundings. A remnant of an  flax mill known as Quigleys Mill. googletag.cmd.push Perhaps the most clear view of the mill is from the top of the hill outside Park Hardware and DIY. Greg McElhinney and Matthew Devine. Inside, owner Greg McElhinney says the last year has been busy. “With construction and everything  closing down last April, we were very busy, which was good for us because people from the local area were able to do home projects,” he tells me. “The weather was good as well, so youd a lot of painting and decorating – fences and gardens and stuff like that – going on. “People were happy there was a local business still operating, because a lot of the bigger hardware stores had closed.     “It got to the stage when it was hard to source materials because suppliers were closed until June time, but people were happy enough to occupy their time. They had nothing  to do.” The remains of Quigleys Mill, Park. Parks postal area recorded an increase in Covid cases last week, and despite the attachment to Derry city skewing the numbers, Greg admits there is still a degree of worry locally. “The majority of the population feel we still have to be serious about this. Its drilled into everybody at this stage, like putting your seatbelt on in the car,” he says. “The worry now is were straddling the Donegal border to a certain extent and case numbers are very high either side of it. “There is more positivity now than there was maybe six weeks ago though. Society is opening up again, and the vaccinations are a positive thing.” Covid has taken its toll on rural le too, and compliance with regulations has come at a social cost for village communities. “Where were based is very much a rural area, with a lot of the farming community and tradesmen and stuff,” says Greg. “You get some people who, by chance, meet up outside the shop here and have an opportunity to have a chat that maybe havent seen each other in a few months. “Those guys would have been at markets or farm meets every week, or pubs, but now you see them sitting out there for half an hour chatting to each other. “The social aspect, face to face, is the biggest thing. “The local community group have done a lot of work with the walkways there over the past number of years, which is very good.” Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty from Learmount Community Development Group. The local community group to which Greg refers is Learmount Community Development Group, which is nestled down a lane next to the entrance to Learmount Forest. Over the last year, Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty have noticed a big increase in people using Parks hidden gem. “We would have come down here some mornings and that car park would be full,” says Caroline. “Our secret Learmount Forest isnt a secret any more, and thats great, because everybody wants out, and weve had drop-ins coming from that.” “The forest has been fantastic for people being able to get out and safely meet their neighbours,” adds Catriona. “Theyll maybe call in at quiet times to have a socially distanced cup of tea. That social aspect has been missed, they are missing company and casual conversation.” Caroline feels the experience of the last year has sharpened focus on the issue of loneliness that had been hiding in plain sight. “We had a man who lives alone and had been sick for two or three days,” she says. “He hadnt been out and had no food in the house, so thankfully we were able to help with that. “You just know people are lonely and looking to get out again, but at the same time are a bit anxious about it. “Theyre happy to take the summer out of it and see what happens. There is certainly a lot of loneliness, isolation and depression though. “You could obviously be in the middle of a housing site and still be lonely, but when you see some of the people on their own, up a lane, they see nobody. They barely even see the postman now.” Working with both young and old people, the group have seen the effect the pandemic and its associated lockdowns have had on both generations.  “A lot of our work is with older people, and whilst theyre saying theyre fed up, some of them are getting a wee bit set in their ways,” says Caroline. “You just know by talking to them. We had a woman who always came in every week, even when it was bad, and she hasnt been in about two months. “Its highlighted how much we miss the social side of things, not being able to get out and meet friends. Even for the youth. “People always think all they need is their phone, because thats all theyre sitting on, but you can see now how the youth are crying out as much for social contact as any other generation.” There is hope though, that with the vaccines roll out and the upcoming warmer weather, that the group will be able to run some of their usual summer events. “We are looking at putting together a summer programme, but wed be a bit nervous ourselves about bringing a group of people into the room,” says Caroline.  “It would be perfectthere was good weather, because it will be planned outdoors. If the weather is bad, well take it over to Park hall, because its a bit bigger than here. “We have funding for dancing and music, which I think people would love to hear. Wed love to have tables out there on a nice evening, with a bit of a barbecue and a bit of music. “Youd like to think by September, we should be able to get going.” On the way back through the village, the shutters are half up on the Rio Grande as preparations continue inside. By the time you read this it will have reopened its doors. Hospitality has ed throughout the county, another step on the road to recovery. The farmers outside Greg McElhinneys store now have somewhere  to shoot the breeze. For the next few weeks at least, Covid fears will be drowned out by clink of glasses, the audible relief of the repressed socialite and the laughter of friends reunited. Dancing, however, is still prohibited under the regulations. It may need to be done across Parks Rio Grande, rather than inside it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was impossible not to notice the atmosphere of optimism at the Lisnagelvin club recently as City of Derry re-opened after too long away, the cobwebs of covid shaken off by the camaraderie and revelry of those who have seen tough times before and come through it together. Unity has ed to the club after a few uncertain years, and as President Billy Jones greeted everyone, as Charlie McDaid walked around with his hands clasped behind his back ensuring everyone had what they needed, and as Treasurer Jim Ross sat and surveyed the club’swith satisfaction, one word sprang to mind – contentment. googletag.cmd.push Just being back at the club and back amongst friends was a huge step that the club has been waiting for, and with a brand-new competitive season approaching fast, the excitement was tangible. If anything, the cub has strengthened over the past year, with President Jones revealing that there have been over  new members joining City of Derry. “This marks the raising of the flag and I’m just delighted with the turnout,” he said. “The new members are playing with the well-established players and it’s great to have this confidence run through the club at the present time. We welcome anyone who is interested in the bowls to come up to City of Derry and you’ll be made most welcome. googletag.cmd.push “Last year, even Covid didn’t put the membership down it actually brought the membership up. More people were out and about. The garden centre is close by and I think people just put their head over the fence and seen that this was an activity that they could get into, so they came and joined us, and we were very fortunate that the numbers were so good.” There was also excited chatter about a few new star players who have joined the club… “We’re very lucky that people who have moved from other clubs have come joined us,” Billy explained. “The quality of player to come to us is very welcome and it’s very, very good for the future of City of Derry, and we have a good chance of playing for some cups in the IBA. The prospects we have would be very good this year and I’d be delightedwe could recognise some of the talent that’s in City of Derry.”      Freedom City of Derry is now in a position to play two teams in the upcoming league, and because of the signicant boost in numbers through new memberships, there is real hope of some silverware for a club that has always had the potential to go further. For former President and current Treasurer Ross, the club is about opportunity – for competition, for friendships, for peace of mind. “Last year we had no competitive bowls because of the lockdown, although we did play some friendly bowls amongst ourselves. It’s good to come up here and get a bit of freedom because it’s good for the mind,” he said. “This year we’re hoping the league will start at the end of May and the start of June. We have a club now with around  members, and we will likely have two teams in the league, an ‘A’ team and a ‘B’ team. Things are looking good,the virus continues the way it’s going. Most people here would be the older generation, although we have some new stars coming through here and we’re hoping to have a good season. “It does help with getting out and meeting with your friends and colleagues but we’re looking forward to competitive bowls again. That’s what it’s all about. It’s a great hobby. Fingers crossed it starts on schedule. This is our official opening day and we’ve had such a great turnout. The weather hasn’t been that good to us, but the turnout has been great.” Bowling has always been on the periphery of sport in Derry, a real niche market compared to the more glamourous sports that attract a large percentage of the youngsters in the city. Bowling is very much a generational game though and the potential to expand and grow is there more than ever for City of Derry. “Clubs like Ballymoney, Coleraine and Limavady have what they call an academy and they have young fellas coming from schools straight into the teams, but we don’t have that facility,” Jim continues. “We don’t have that facility here, but we would love to have it. It’s hard for us to attract the young people because most of us are the older generation, but we have one or two star players who are younger, andpeople see that we’re progressing we might draw more young people. In years gone by you could have played bowls in Derry seven days a week, especially indoor. We all enjoy the outdoors, and everyone is excited to get it open again and get it done. They are all waiting to see the teams picked so they can get into competitive bowls again.”  Mixed bowls for the first time For the first time in the club’s history, this year will see women integrated into the league, a recent law change permitting mixed teams, opening up yet another door for those who love the game. For Jim, this move only strengthens the club even further. “Women can now join our club and take part which wasn’t the case before,” he revealed. “We had a separate ladies’ team here but they were struggling for numbers. The governing bodies changed the rules and said that women can play with men now and take part in the leagues as equals That strengthens us, especiallyyou have a good lady bowler. We’re quite happy to have them. “Doors are opening that haven’t before, and of course we are all cross-community- it doesn’t matter what colour or what creed you are, we’re just happy to have you. If you can walk and throw a bowl then we want you. “We have some great new signings. We were never top of the league but we were always sort of in the middle of the league but I think this year we could have a very good year, and maybe even get a bit of silverware.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As well as being part of a major community development in Creggan which will bring the club’s facilities into the st century, the club have recently unveiled an U girls team, while their senior team heads into the Neal Carlin Cup final against Glack this weekend. Ciaran Wilkinson, part of the Dolan’s team which won the treble back in , is in as manager for the first time, and, following victories over Limavady Reserves, Drum and Faughanvale Reserves, they are just one game away from silverware. googletag.cmd.push It would be a nice way to begin a managerial career that ‘Wilkie’ never, ever saw coming. “I never thought about it but when your body doesn’t let you play anymore, it’s a close second,” he said. “I was just asked would I like to do it and I jumped at it, and got my team around me and that was it. “I’m enjoying the challenge to be honest. It’s nothing compared to playing, but I’m enjoying it. It’s still very early and things are going well, but it always is when you are getting results. It’s only pre-season, it’s not the league or the Championship, but it’s going alright.” googletag.cmd.push Ciaran has his own ideas of how he wants to manage, insisting he wants to change the mindsets of the players to help them realise their potential. “I want boys to believe in their own ability and back themselves,” he explained. That was me as a player no matter who you are up against in that ision, you have to back yourself, so it’s just a matter of getting the players to believe that they are good enough and against anyone in that ision, they’ll give them a game not to fear anybody andyou approach every game like that you have a good a chance as they do.”     Glack are tomorrow night’s opponents, reaching Celtic Park by defeating Craigbane Reserves, Magilligan and Steelstown Reserves. Whilst the silverware would be nice, there is something more important for the new Dolans manager. “I just want them to enjoy it more than anything,” he admitted. “You don’t get to finals every whiparound. I never enjoyed it much as a player, soanything, I’m hoping to get the players to enjoy it win, lose or draw. That’s why we’re playing the game at the end of the day it’s not always about winning. Of course, it would be nice to win, and it’s better when you’re winning, but I’m just drilling it into them to enjoy it. I didn’t win anything until I was almost finished, and I wish I had enjoyed it more, soI can get them to enjoy it, without us focusing on the win, I’ll be happy enough with that to be honest.”  Notable addition A notable addition to the Dolans coaching staff this year is that of Ciara McGurk, someone who knows all about winning due to her success in recent years for both club and county. Still a player with Steelstown, Ciara has now stepped into the coaching side of the game, and such is her reputation in the game, that Wilkinson sees it as a huge benefit to have her as part of the team. The addition of a female coach at senior level adds something dferent he believes. “Ciara is there on merit,” he said. “I have watched her up close and from afar and she’s a great coach. She’s passionate and she brings a set of skills to the table. There’s not many people around the town has that experience or those medals. It’s great. I didn’t even have to think about it when I was asked. It was just about thinking outside the box, and she’s capable, and the fact that she’s a girl didn’t even come into it. It’s what she brings to it and she’s there on merit.” Geoffrey McGonigle, manager of the  treble-winning team, has also agreed toto the coaching set-up at Dolans, meaning there is no shortage of winning experience at the club this year.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Candystripes are the only team in the Premier Division without a home win so far, but since the arrival of new manager Ruaidhri Higgins, they have been superb on the road, winning at Sligo Rovers, Bohemians and Waterford and drawing with champions Shamrock Rovers. That elusive home win was just minutes away against St. Patrick’s Athletic on Monday evening, only for a late equaliser to deny the hosts the three points. It was not from lack of effort however against one of the Premier Division’s most improved teams. googletag.cmd.push “We had to dig in,” midfielder Ciaron Harkin said. “It was a scrap all over the pitch and it was hard at times to get the ball down and get it moving as both teams got in each other’s faces trying to cancel each other out. I thought we dug in well and we had the chance to win it, but we conceded a goal at the end. “We don’t really look at that home record. Be it home games or away games, you get the same points. It’s about working on our performances and trying to get as many points on the board and as many wins as possible. It wasn’t our day , we thought it was when Joe put us into the lead, but we’ll just have to keep digging in and go to Friday and push even harder for another win.” googletag.cmd.push Those three away wins have made City one of the most consistent teams in the ision away from home. Bohemians’ - win over Dundalk on Monday night shows just how dficult away games can be, making that recent away record all the more impressive according to Harkin. “The away form has been good so hopefully we can keep the confidence and the consistency up,” he continued. “Obviously it is tough playing away from home but everyone is working hard together so hopefully we can get the three points. “It’s about consistency. You see Dundalk go and get a good win against Rovers, the league leaders. But then they get beaten by Bohs this week, so anything can happen and it’s about making sure you’re on the right end of it and you can push up that table, which is the main thing.”     Midfielder Marc Walsh is the only injury doubt for Higgins as City chase the win which could see them leapfrog Dundalk into seventh.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Candystripes are the only team in the Premier Division without a home win so far, but since the arrival of new manager Ruaidhri Higgins, they have been superb on the road, winning at Sligo Rovers, Bohemians and Waterford and drawing with champions Shamrock Rovers. That elusive home win was just minutes away against St. Patrick’s Athletic on Monday evening, only for a late equaliser to deny the hosts the three points. It was not from lack of effort however against one of the Premier Division’s most improved teams. googletag.cmd.push “We had to dig in,” midfielder Ciaron Harkin said. “It was a scrap all over the pitch and it was hard at times to get the ball down and get it moving as both teams got in each other’s faces trying to cancel each other out. I thought we dug in well and we had the chance to win it, but we conceded a goal at the end. “We don’t really look at that home record. Be it home games or away games, you get the same points. It’s about working on our performances and trying to get as many points on the board and as many wins as possible. It wasn’t our day , we thought it was when Joe put us into the lead, but we’ll just have to keep digging in and go to Friday and push even harder for another win.” googletag.cmd.push Those three away wins have made City one of the most consistent teams in the ision away from home. Bohemians’ - win over Dundalk on Monday night shows just how dficult away games can be, making that recent away record all the more impressive according to Harkin. “The away form has been good so hopefully we can keep the confidence and the consistency up,” he continued. “Obviously it is tough playing away from home but everyone is working hard together so hopefully we can get the three points. “It’s about consistency. You see Dundalk go and get a good win against Rovers, the league leaders. But then they get beaten by Bohs this week, so anything can happen and it’s about making sure you’re on the right end of it and you can push up that table, which is the main thing.”     Midfielder Marc Walsh is the only injury doubt for Higgins as City chase the win which could see them leapfrog Dundalk into seventh.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His -year playing career ended on the Evergreens in the early s.Joersquos role as match secretary for twenty years was absolutely crucial given his unique ability to dig out players when all seemed lost, recruiting players at Down High on Saturday mornings to fulfil fixtures later that day.Complete strangers would often turn up for second  matches in the early days saying that Joe had instructed them to turn up and play.Despite his tireless work on behalf of the club, Joersquos greatest pleasure throughout his rugby le has been the friends he has made along the way.A keen tourist, he has travelled the world to follow rugby and even took in some of the Lions fixtures in South Africa in .He was tour manager on the legendary  Ballynahinch tour of Canada, as well as partaking in a few trips away with the Evergreens.When promotion to the All-Ireland League was secured in , Joe was a regular spectator at games all over the country and could be seen at every first XV home fixture in his familiar spot on the m line until very recently.The flat cap, long navy Adidas coat, familiar cough and half pint of Harp should conjure up an image of Joe to everyone who knows him, and to countless others who have passed through the Ballynahinch club in recent years not knowing the huge influence he has had on their rugby.Joe is the recipient of the coveted Spence Cup this season. He is truly deserving of this award and it is le-affirming to see that friendships gained through team sports run deep as Sam Robinson, himself a Spence Cup winner, acts as carer for Joe as his health deteriorates.Rugby it seems, is giving something back to one of itrsquos finest local servants.On behalf of the Spence family, Emma Rice commened: ldquoThe Spence Cup is given to a member who shows an example of commitment to the rugby club. Joe Carlislersquos service to the club in time and deed epitomises this.ldquoA society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they will never sit in. We are often guilty of not noticing a tree that gives the shade we sit under, she continued.ldquoPlayers of today may no longer see as much of that familiar face on the m line at Ballymacarn Park, but they will see the roots, the structure, the shade and benefit from what wee Joe once planted.

Itrsquos been very challenging for carers and their loved ones, and people often forget that carersrsquo lives are adversely affected too.ldquoImagine having a spouse or parent who no longer recognises you and who due to this awful disease you no longer recognise.One of the things that resonates with both women is the thought of any loved one losing all our precious memories.Ciara continued: ldquoResearch into the causes of, and treatment for dementia is critically important but not a priority for UK governments.ldquoWe would love to see this dreadful disease eradicated for future generations. We both have strong ties to Northern Ireland, being from here, although we both spent time living and working in England and Scotland before moving home to settle back in Co Down. Our mutual love of baking and cooking was how we met and became friends.The two bakers organised a virtual bake sale to raise money for dementia research.However they soon realised that due to geography not everyone could buy their fabulous baking, so they set up a JustGiving page to run alongside the bake sale.ldquoPlanning the challenges of a bake sale during lockdown was fun, so too was choosing some of our most popular products to sell to raise money, said Sharon.ldquoThe menu proved so popular.

The former dismissed both Carson and Linehan in the same over to swing the match back in favour for Dundrum.This started a Downpatrick collapse with the last eight wickets falling for only  runs.

But also to strengthen school community and pride in our fantastic school.Mr Austin paid tribute to the schools PTFA for its fundraising, to the board of governors for support and a group of volunteers who worked on the welcome garden.ldquoThe team spirit that has been displayed throughout this project has been uplting and a reflection of the strong school community that exists within St Colmcilles Primary School, he said.ldquoThe board of governors have supported this project throughout and are committed to a cycle of continuous improvement of all aspects of the school, especially its facilities and resourcesHe continued: ldquoThe PTFA have fundraised relentlessly through organising ious raffles, draws, bingos and hampers.

He had been a vital cog in the Down Rec team which enjoyed great success in the late Seventies.But it was and remains the case that the Down Rec experience is defined by the enduring friendships which have stood the test of time.Coot grew up in Stream Street and the reason he knocked back opportunities to perform at levels his talent merited may well lie there.That part of Downpatrick had three working class housing developments, Ardpatrick and Russell Park with Stream Street and Ibrox Park in the middle.Ibrox was their playground, the place where Coot first kicked a football.He was a Stream Street kid and it seems he never wanted to be anything .When Jim Prior took him to Down Rec, it was a marriage made in heaven.In that dressing room you had another more senior Stream Street kid. Coot would have idolized Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran in those days as he was the leader of the pack.Russell Park resident Barney Fitzsimmons was there too, a swashbuckling goalscorer who enjoyed something akin to Roy of the Rovers status at the time.Then you had the late great Paddy lsquoGeordyrsquo Galbraith, who combined a hard man reputation with a heart of gold.Peter Mulhall was another player he would have admired, a winner who proved the perfect centre back partner for the laid-back Coot.The total respect he had for them was accorded to all of us even though he was a better player than any of us. That was Coot Connolly.Prior realized that he needed to recruit from outside Downpatrick to fulfill his ambitions for the club and over a period of time he recruited players from Portaferry, Strangford, Ardglass, Dundrum, Crossgar, Saintfield, Killyleagh and Ballygowan.They were brought in for their ability but Jim couldnrsquot have known that the erse personalities therein would create the perfect storm in the dressing room.Neither could he have anticipated the level of support which flowed from those villages in the seasons to come.Dressing rooms are bastions of banter and slagging and with Dart jester-in chief, the group relished every minute they spent together.The five strong Portaferry contingent proved to be a vital ingredient, their earthy Ards humour and the opportunities their accents provided for slagging sealing their popularity.Jackie Leckey and Barney Ross brought another dimension willing as they were to join in the shenanigans on and off the pitch. Coot loved the craic and happily joined in the banter.However, he left the slagging to other less sensitive creatures of which there were plenty.A good example was the time I decided to get the footballers perm which was in vogue at the time. I should have known better.I got slaughtered, Dart declaring that I looked more like Shirley Temple than Kevin Keegan.Those were the days, as the saying goes, but happily there were plenty of good days ahead of us.We have had many reunions with Coot, an ever present and every one of them underlined the strength of the bond we enjoy so much.Sadly those reunions tend to be confined to wakes and funerals nowadays and the baby of our team has now joined Shane Breen, Paddy Galbraith and Marty Ross on the sidelines.Coot would have been the first to remind me that the Rec wasnrsquot only about the players.The one and only Charlie Oakes was highly influential in his role as assistant manager, while Austy Keating doubled as chairman and groundsman for many years.Joe Lyttle was our physio and his son Joea loyal player for years while my sister Tina was a committee member and a fanatical fan.They were all fully paid up members of the Rec family and we continue to mourn their loss.I would love to have name checked every single member of the Rec family in this piece but time and space didnrsquot allow. My apologies.The laughter which rang through Cootrsquos house during his wake was a fitting farewell for someone who loved to laugh.He was a very special human being. We will miss him forever.

Alban seems to think that it’s all right to weaken Israel’s defence capability relative to neighbouring Muslim states. Because I found Mr Maginness’ article to be objectionable, in the antipathic attitude it expresses towards Israel, I wrote to the editor of the Belfastand which letter may bear repeating. My letter reads: “Alban Maginness gives a rather one-sidedview of the ongoing conflict in the Holy Land. The Belfast , May . “Alban views the conflict from a narrow Northern Ireland perspective: he appears to be blind to the geographic and political realities of the Middle East and Israel’s precarious security situation there. “In the ongoing conflict, it is Israel that is the beleaguered state and Israel is, and has always been, facing an existential threat from the neighbouring States. By comparison with these states, Israel is a tiny Jewish state with little by way of natural geographical defences for its protection against the much larger surrounding Muslim states and hostile forceswith their huge land mass, oil and other resources and populations amounting to hundreds of millions. “To look at the Holy Land conflict exclusively as a Jewish Palestinian problem without reference to this much bigger political, geographical and military landscape, seems to be poor,not threadbare, analysis.”Micheal O’Cathail, By email• Jackie Goodall: Ireland shows itself to be Europe’s most anti-Israel nation——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It is hard to see how a three-way split can be sustained, yet there is a case for two main unionist blocs — a moderate one and a conservative one.There is an increasing view that a single unionist party would just drive more voters to the neutral political centre.The biggest issue by far facing unionism is the NI Protocol Boris Johnson betrayal. Senior DUP politicians have seemed far too willing to accept tough talk from Tories such as Lord Frost. Yet London keeps reiterating its commitment to the protocol, about which Brussels is so uncompromising. The UK says the Act of Union has been partially repealed and we must assume that is the situation . It is an outrage, yet Edwin Poots has to date been pragmatic about this Irish Sea border. Doug Beattie yesterday seemed to say on radio that the protocol was less important than the NHS, but the comparison is misleading because it is an utterly dferent policy area. It is possible both to think that health is the single most important non constitutional matter, but that the constitutional question is the single most important political issue.That is what republicans think, yet they do not allow themselves to be talked into saying the NHS is more important.A united unionist rejection of the repeal of the Act of Union can, and should, exist alongside a wide range of views among unionists on non constitutional matters.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The votes that are going to be shed by the DUP is not in their hundreds, it’s in their thousands. It’s in their tens of thousands,” he said.“We cannot go round the doors, the people in Fermanagh and South Tyrone will vote for anyone but the DUP. That is because, not of an election, that is because of what took place before the election.”Mr Poots later addressed the media alongside the newly ratied deputy leader Paula Bradley, with supporters gathered behind him.He described the meeting as “good” and said it is a “great privilege” to now lead the party that his father had helped form  years ago.Mr Poots said there had been a debate and a contest, and that the contest “had been decided”.“We will move forward in a united way,” he said.“The DUP is not a ided party, the DUP has went through an electoral contest, the first in  years, and everybody that goes through an electoral contest will have some passion, and passion is good in politics.“I like to see people having passion, sometimes even when they are people contesting with me. I like to see people who are passionate in their arguments.”Mr Poots added that he hoped to be able to speak to Mr Bell “in the near future”.“Sometimes people don’t like the outcome and they do things in the heat of the moment, I have a lot of respect for the gentleman,” he said.Mr Poots narrowly defeated Sir Jeffrey Donaldson earlier this month in the party’s first leadership contest.In a speech following his ratication, he vowed to revive unionism and scrap the Northern Ireland Protocol.“We will consistently roll back the objectional provisions of the Protocol, as we have been doing,” he said.“That involves arguing our case forcefully and with conviction. It involves making Brussels and Dublin aware that the Protocol is intolerable and unworkable.“Legal challenges are one correct tactic, but the guaranteed way of reading our sales of the isive Protocol is through the Assembly.”He added: “We will employ political tactics to continue the pressure, and let Dublin see that isn’t some hiccup, but rather something that has the worrying capacity to destabilise relationships that they have gained most from.”Mr Poots said his challenge was to encourage supporters of unionism to get out and vote.He also called for a “united unionist coalition” ahead of the next Assembly elections.Mr Poots said the only way of preventing a border poll and getting rid of the Protocol was by securing a Unionist majority at the next election.In his speech, Mr Poots paid tribute to Ms Foster’s leadership of the party.He said: “Arlene is and will be regarded as one of the most foremost women and unionists in British politics.“Irrespective of our dferences in any issues that have brought us here this evening, she is admired by us all.”Mrs Foster announced her resignation as First Minister and DUP leader last month following an internal revolt against her leadership.She said she would step down as DUP leader on Friday and as First Minister at the end of June.Earlier this week, Mrs Foster said she still had not seen the reported letter of no confidence in her leadership.DUP MP Ian Paisley said he understands the party chairman Lord Morrow has read the letter to her and told her the names who signed it.“The process that the party has always adopted is that those letters are not shared with other people who have gone,” he said.“My father never ever saw the requisition order that was signed against him. He accepted it because he accepted the good grace and standing of our party chairman.”Mr Poots has signalled that he will become the first DUP leader not to take the First Minister position at Stormont, and will instead nominate a colleague in order to focus on the job of leading the party.MLAs Mervyn Storey and Paul Givan are reportedly being considered for the post.  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularDUP in crisis - PSNI receive complaint that DUP members were allegedly threatened and intimidated by UDADr Christian Jessen seeks public help to fight Arlene Foster libel damagesDUP member dramatically resigns from party after Edwin Poots ratied as leaderEdwin Poots is ratied as DUP leader as key figures leave meeting before speechEx-DUP MLA: Arlene Foster has undermined the Union and NI is in a dangerous place – but a united Ireland could workMost PopularHuge fireball spotted in NI night sky was like something from the film ArmageddonJudge has ‘heavy heart’ as he jails brothers with clear records for attack on police at internment bonfireI hope this sentence brings you comfort, judge tells family, as she jails drink driver who killed friend in head-on smashAllister turns question on speeding into Bobby Storey funeral barbDUP’s isions now in full view as party members publicly slug it out over Arlene Foster’s ousting                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kafWEX sc-feJyhm dbjzDR\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedFashion and BeautyDealsHome and GardenPublic NoticesFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt was girl power when ten female walkers joined Joy and sheepdog Bracken from Penarth and District Ramblers at Penarth clftop for an . mile walk, with no stiles only gates and which would see them experiencing the weather of all four seasons in one day. They set off on a socially distanced walk in lovely spring sunshine across the old pitch and putt course before joining part of the old railway line, now a walk and cycle way, and heading through a built up area Lavernock Road led them into Cosmeston Country Park.Past the eastern lake with its floating jetty where canoes can be safely launched and making their way through the eastern paddock with its carpet of pretty cowslips, open meadows led them towards Old Cogan Hall Farm, where they deviated into the churchyard of St Peterrsquos for morning break in glorious warm sunshine reminiscent of summer. Admiring the herring bone masonry which dates to Celtic and Saxon times and the ancient yew trees that could even pre-date this lovely old church, which allegedly is the oldest building in Penarth and hearing some of its long and interesting history, it fell into disrepair in the th century. By the th century the ruinous building was a cattle shelter until the latter part of the rsquos when the rd Marquis of Bute was persuaded to pay for its renovation.Mile Road built by the Bute family led them to the western paddock and through the sun-dappled Cogan Wood to re-enter fields where a footbridge led them across the Sully Brook for the short climb up to Home Farm, with its glorious views towards the eastern end of Barry and the surrounding farmland. Exiting through a gate, some road walking in a southerly direction brought them into Sully village and pounding pavements to reach the Jubilee Hall and the cricket field, the full beauty of Sully Bay with its views across the Bristol Channel towards the Somerset coastline and Hayes Point to the west confronted them.     With the wind beginning to pick up they tramped by track and field to the public slipway at Sully beach and stopped for lunch utilising rocks for seating whilst gazing eastwards towards Sully Island and Flat and Steep Holm beyond, as clouds thickened overhead and the temperature dropped making it feel more like autumn.Time to move on along part of the long distance Wales Coast Path, through the playing fields to exit onto Beach Road, following it to the car park of the Captainrsquos We where there were only a few people sitting at outdoor tables for food and drink, not really enjoyable in the cool breeze.The fairly quiet St Maryrsquos Well Bay Road brought them up past The Bay Caravan Park and into fields with growing crops where, without any warning a sudden short sharp shower of rain engulfed the group forcing coats to be swtly donned.Crossing a wooden footbridge into the delightful Lavernock Nature Reserve the grassy path led them into the remains of the WW gun emplacements. Initially in the late rsquos the original Lavernock Gun Battery was built to protect the Bristol and Cardf shipyards and the Bristol Channel, but unfortunately most of the original buildings now lie underneath the caravan park.Being bombarded by a short hail storm whilst moving on through the nature reserve, lovingly cared for by volunteers and passing the man-made pond with its surrounding carpet of bluish violet bugle, a plant which attracts moths, butterflies and bees, before exiting onto Fort Road their route led them past the Marconi Holiday Village and the Church of St Lawrence before heading along the clftop. With thick black clouds heading up the English side of the Bristol Channel, the race was on to get back before the rain hit. As the weather turned wintry and the wind increased, a huge shower of hailstones and heavy rain struck them on the open Penarth clftop soaking them as they made their way back to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits before, during and after lockdown on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
