So we\u0027re definitely seeing a bounce-back from all of that, and we believe given the products we sell, being the engagement rings, the diamond rings, the wedding rings - we see that continuing throughout this year.\u0027But we\u0027re also seeing a significant increase in Swiss watches, so people wanting to treat themselves. So I think there\u0027s a real balance between gifting for others and actually just wanting to treat themselves, they\u0027ve probably saved a lot of money.\u0027I think through lockdown we saw online that people weren\u0027t going away, they were getting refunds and they weren\u0027t spending and treating themselves. And now I think there\u0027s still limitations to what people can do and I think they\u0027re thinking they\u0027ve always wanted that Swiss watch or that diamond ring.\u0027Style experts have predicted that Britain is gearing up for a post-lockdown \u0027fiesta in make-up and in fragrances\u0027 not seen since the Roaring 1920s. L\u0027Oreal, the world\u0027s biggest make-up brand, predicts a post-pandemic sales bonanza when wearing lipstick will become \u0027a symbol of returning to life\u0027.That upbeat message was last night backed by fashion experts who claimed that lockdown-weary Brits are aching for the chance to dress up and socialise in safety again.In a reference to the hedonism of the 1920s following the First World War and 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, L\u0027Oreal\u0027s chief executive Jean-Paul Agon predicted a party atmosphere when Covid-19 is finally tamed.\u0027This will be like the Roaring Twenties, there will be a fiesta in make-up and in fragrances,\u0027 he said.\u0027Putting on lipstick again will be a symbol of returning to life.\u0027Leading make-up artist Ruby Hammer, who has styled A-list clients such as supermodels Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell, agreed.\u0027We are already putting emphasis on our eyes and eyebrows by virtue of having to wear a mask but when we can reveal a little bit more of our face we will go bonkers,\u0027 she said.\u0027As human beings we love to celebrate - and make-up gives us a boost. In the 1920s, instead of people saying \u0027woe is me\u0027, they celebrated and looked fabulous doing it. So, there is no doubt that we will want to present to the world the same opulence and we do that by expressing ourselves through the way we look.\u0027It won\u0027t be seen as self-indulgence but something as very important. A beautiful fragrance or lipstick can make you feel wow.\u0027The \u0027Roaring Twenties\u0027, when people defied society\u0027s conventions by wearing daring fashions and holding wild parties, was most famously chronicled in F Scott Fitzgerald\u0027s novel The Great Gatsby. \u0027It was an age of miracles,\u0027 the novelist once wrote. \u0027It was an age of art, it was an age of excess.\u0027Cosmetic sales have plummeted during the coronavirus crisis as store closures, coupled with the shift to homeworking, prompted many women to ditch make-up with sales of foundation and lipstick plunging during the original lockdown by more than 70 per cent. But Lesley Blair, chair of the British Association of Beauty Therapy And Cosmetology, believes the cosmetics industry will prosper post-lockdown.\u0027There will be an absolute boom when this nightmare is over,\u0027 she said. \u0027We will be buying more than we\u0027ve ever bought before. We are desperate to get dressed up and with a little bit more disposable income that will be possible. Putting a little bit of lipstick on solves everything.\u0027Trend forecaster Andrew Ibi, of pressure group Fashion Academics Creating Equality, agrees that the sales bonanza will be driven by people\u0027s simple desire to feel good.\u0027Post-pandemic, we will be looking for ways to reconnect socially – clothes, hair and make-up will be part of the therapy,\u0027 he said.    "},{"url":null,"title":"Londons City University renames Cass Business School","story":"Share this articleBayes\u0027 alma mater gave his name to a £45million research centre connected to its informatics department in 2018.

It was the first time in the history of Minnesota that a white police officer has been convicted of murdering a Black person while on duty. The Reuters news agency called it a milestone in the fraught racial history of the United States and a rebuke of law enforcement’s treatment of Black Americans. “As we have painfully witnessed in recent days and weeks, reforms to policing departments across the US continue to be insufficient to stop people of African descent from being killed,” Bachelet said in a statement. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned.“No working American should lose a single dollar from their paycheck because they chose to fulfill their patriotic duty of getting vaccinated,” the president said. Biden emphasized that many more American adults need to get vaccinated, especially now that vaccines are more widely available. “To put it simply, if you’ve been waiting for your turn, wait no longer,” Biden said. Vaccines can both help prevent coronavirus infections among those who receive them and protect the broader community from an outbreak, the president noted. Echoing public health experts, Biden reiterated that vaccines are the country’s way out of the pandemic.The president said the country is “entering a new phase” in its vaccination efforts, now that all American adults are eligible to receive a vaccine. “Now our objective is to reach everyone – everyone over the age of 16 in America,” Biden said at the White House. As expected, the president announced the country will soon administer the 200 millionth vaccine dose since he took office in January. Biden said data will soon show that “today we did it,” with 200m doses delivered by his 92nd day in office. The president initially promised to administer 100m doses over his first 100 days, but he doubled that goal after hitting 100m shots last month, weeks ahead of schedule.Jen Psaki described the death of Bryant as “tragic,” noting it came “just as America was hopeful of a step forward” following the announcement of a guilty verdict in the Derek Chauvin trial. On the subject of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, Psaki said the president intended to use the bully pulpit to ensure a policing reform bill makes it to his desk soon. “The stage we’re in now is that leaders on the Hill need to have discussions among themselves about where they can find agreement,” Psaki said. Biden has invited 40 world leaders to a two-day virtual gathering starting on Earth Day, Thursday, as the opening salvo in negotiations leading to crunch United Nations talks in Scotland later this year. Scientists say the world is severely lagging in tackling the climate crisis and its heatwaves, storms and floods, with planet-heating emissions set to roar back following a dip due to coronavirus shutdowns. Much will hinge upon cooperation between China, the world’s worst producer of planet-heating emissions, and the US, historically the worst polluter. On Saturday, John Kerry, Biden’s climate envoy, struck an agreement in Shanghai to urgently address what Kerry called the “beyond catastrophic” consequences of allowing temperatures to spiral upwards. The compact is broadly seen as encouraging but comes amid US-China tensions on issues including human rights and trade. The US also faces a deficit in credibility after the presidency of Donald Trump, which saw the country leave the Paris climate accords and dismantle environmental protections. “Now is the time to step up our efforts to reach every working-age adult in America, and today’s announcement to help employers offset the cost of paid time off is an important step in getting America’s workforce vaccinated,” the White House said.In a new statement, the White House confirmed the president will use his speech this afternoon to announce that tomorrow the country will hit 200 million vaccine doses distributed since he took office in January. Biden will also lay out his vision to incentivize more Americans to get vaccinated, as shots become more widely available across the country. “As the Administration works to get even more people vaccinated, President Biden will call on employers across America to do everything they can to help their employees – and their communities – get vaccinated,” the White House said. “As part of that effort, President Biden is calling on every employer in America to offer full pay to their employees for any time off needed to get vaccinated and for any time it takes to recover from the after-effects of vaccination. He will announce a paid leave tax credit that will offset the cost for employers with fewer than 500 employees to provide full pay for any time their employees need to get a COVID-19 vaccination or recover from that vaccination.” The president will deliver his speech on vaccine administration strategy in about an hour, so stay tuned.According to Scott, there are still four to five outstanding issues that Democrats and Republicans must work out before the compromise bill can be introduced. The House passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act last month, but that version of the bill likely cannot make it through the evenly ided Senate. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said this morning, “We will not rest until the Senate passes strong legislation to end the systemic bias in law enforcement.”The president spoke to Floyd’s family on Monday, as the jury in Minneapolis began its deliberations over the charges against Chauvin. Floyd noted Biden has spent some time with the family on “numerous” occasions since his brother’s death last year. “He just made us feel a lot better because the president has so much to do, and he spent just that time with us,” Floyd said. “That made us all feel good.”With intense international interest in the US trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd, news organisations around the world had been live blogging the proceedings and were quick to reflect the ruling by the jury. Most reporting focused on two themes: a sense of relief in the US that the jury had delivered a verdict many judged correct and the question over what it meant for the future of the US’s fraught racial relations. “On Tuesday, the United States closed a transcendental chapter in its racial history, which is this country’s original sin,” wrote El País’s US bureau chief, Amanda Mars. “In a country where police convictions are rare, for many activists this could be a turning point in the long trajectory of police brutality against black people.” Under the headline “America relieved by historic verdict in the George Floyd case”, the French newspaper Le Monde described the crowd gathered outside the courtroom, eyes fixed to their phones, describing a cheer as the verdict of guilty was delivered. The Times of India reflected a similar sentiment: “Tears of joy, relief after conviction in Floyd murder case”. For its part, Germany’s mass-market tabloid Bild was blunt: “Killer Cop Guilty!” The progressive congresswoman argued it was shameful that the country did not know whether Chauvin would be found guilty, despite the evidence against him. “We saw a murder in front of all of our eyes, and yet we didn’t know if there would be a guilty verdict -- it tells you everything,” Ocasio-Cortez said in an Instagram video. She added, “And that’s why I think it’s really important that this verdict is not used as a replacement for policy change.”"},{"url":null,"title":"as soon as i picked up the ball i just loved it wales winger jaz joyce on her journey to representing the nation","story":"Despite being in the middle of the Women’s Six Nations tournament, the 25-year-old is currently in Loughborough – because the Wales player is also training with the Team GB Sevens squad in the run up to the Olympic Games. “I can’t describe the feeling of representing your country in a sport you love, it’s an overwhelming feeling and it’s just everything,” says Joyce. Now an Olympian and Wales international, Joyce started playing rugby at local club St Davids, inspired by a teacher at her Pembrokeshire secondary school. “As soon as I picked up the ball I just loved it,” she says. “I was six or seven, and I haven’t stopped playing since. As a child I knew I wanted to play for Wales, but we didn’t have the role models that young girls have now – and if you wanted to watch women’s rugby then you had to go to the stadium and watch in person.” Joyce played many sports growing up, including county-level netball, but soon had to make the choice. “It wasn’t feasible playing so many sports, and my parents kept having to take me to all these different clubs. I enjoyed rugby the most so I decided to stick with it.” It’s a decision that Wales fans will thank her for, but one that hasn’t come without serious sacrifices. Just three months into her first year of university, when most students are partying at night and living on packet noodles, Joyce was called up to the Wales squad to play in the Dubai Sevens tournament. “It was a dream for me to play rugby, but I had to choose to focus on it,” she says.  Joyce’s dedication to the game is unquestionable. On top of the travelling involved for her club commitments (around one hour and 45 minutes each way from Joyce’s home to her Bristol training ground), the amateur status of Wales Women means that players need to work as well as playing for club and country. “At the moment, the hours we put into training is practically like being a full-time rugby player, but we then work 37-hour-a-week jobs, or go to university on top of that, and try to filter in any family time as well,” she says. It’s also becoming harder for countries such as Wales to challenge the professional set-ups of countries such as the now professional-level England and semi-professional France – as witnessed with Wales’ 53-0 loss to France in the first round of the tournament. “We believed we were going to go there and put up a fight,” she says. “France are full-time, so it’s inevitable that these things will happen there’s only so much we can train. Joyce says that there is a lot of work going on behind the scenes at the Welsh Rugby Union to secure contracts for players, so that they can excel and show what they’re capable of. “It’s really hard to compete against teams who are professionals when we are balancing full-time jobs. I’d love to see contracts come in this year.” The 25-year-old recently made the choice to stop saying no to things in her personal life and is currently in the final stages of completing her teacher training at University of Wales Trinity Saint David – although this is paused while she works with Team GB. “I’ve just decided to live my life and do what I want – I was putting my life on hold.” While the demands on a women’s rugby player are huge, the benefits far outweigh the sacrifices for Joyce. “It’s my way of giving back to my parents and everyone who helped me when I was younger. My parents love it – they follow me everywhere! When I was selected for the Olympics they were straight on that plane.” "},{"url":null,"title":"from grassroots games to the womens six nations how poppy and bryony cleall became rugby stars","story":"There are a number of twins who play professional rugby – England’s Tom and Ben Curry, or Jordan and Ryan Olowofela, or the South African Kriel twins – but the Clealls are the only female twins in the world who both play full-time professional rugby. Poppy has 45 caps for England, Bryony has three, and they both play in the Premier 15s at Saracens. Taking to the pitch together, they were quick to show their twin connection, with Poppy setting Bryony up with a quick pass that let the prop bundle over the line for her second try in an England shirt. “When you play for England everything is choreographed,” Poppy says, explaining how the twins’ try came to be. “I just got into my position. Normally I look left and right and say something to a teammate, but with Bryony I just give her the look and she knows what I mean.” Playing together for England is a dream that the 28-year-old twins have been building since childhood. They got close to achieving this in 2019, when they were both on the team sheet for the Women’s Six Nations fixture against Ireland. “Bryony got her first cap, but I came off before she went on, so we weren’t actually on the pitch together.” The pair started by watching their older brother play. “He was in an after-school rugby club, and my mum could only come to pick us all up at once, so Bryony and I had to stay until four o’clock and watch Josh play rugby. Then one time the coach asked if we wanted to join in – we of course said yes.” When the family moved to Bournemouth, Poppy and Bryony were keen to continue playing. “My parents emailed our local rugby club to say they had two children who wanted to play. The club said ‘great, bring them down’, but apparently changed their tune when they found out we were two girls. At first we were the only girls in the minis’ section, but the chairman had a daughter who also wanted to join, which helped.” The small club, Ellingham and Ringwood RFC in the New Forest, has become a surprising hub for women’s rugby, counting four ex-players in this year’s Women’s Six Nations. As well as the Cleall twins, there’s newly-capped Wales player Donna Rose and Scotland’s Lisa Cockburn. “I think that must be a record to get four international players from one club! For the boys, they all go to elite schools and rugby academies, but from the same grassroots club – that’s not bad is it?” The team was supported by the twins’ dad Peter, who was manager of the under-18s girls’ team. “My dad was very passionate. He and the chairman really wanted to push for equal opportunities for us, so they used to take us on tours all around the country.” Although the Cleall family couldn’t be there to watch Poppy and Bryony play together in Doncaster, family and friends could watch the game on BBC iPlayer. It’s the first time that all Women’s Six Nations games have been broadcast on one platform, which is something Poppy is pleased to see. “The coverage this year is triple of what I’ve seen before. When I’m going through social media, I’m seeing so much more coverage of players and their stories. “England’s final game will be on BBC Two, so the girls are looking forward to that,” says Poppy. “The production of the games is just great – so much better than in the past, it’s really positive.” The increased coverage of women’s rugby and the improved production values of the broadcasts offer a glimpse at the investment to come – which Poppy gets to experience first-hand as one of the few professional women’s rugby players in the world. In January 2019, England became the first side to award full-time professional contracts to its women’s players, which included former prison officer Poppy. The other benefit of being part of a professional set-up is the additional time together to train. “We’re getting to meet up and work on little bits together constantly – you can see the difference. You might say a girl has potential, but then you give her a contract and you see their skill level go up, their fitness goes up, and what they produce on the field is better.” The ability to play rugby full-time means Poppy is becoming one of the best rugby players in the world – a compliment she quickly brushes off. “My coach said to me at the start of this season: ‘Do you know the difference between an international player and a world class player?’ I said no, and he said that a world class player will take the people around them to a different level and make their teammates better. That’s what I want – I don’t want to be a standout player in England, I want the team to have 15 world-class players on the pitch.” "},{"url":null,"title":"the history of womens rugby and why it is finally having its moment","story":"“I never thought I’d be a professional player,” she says today, just six months after her retirement from the game. “When I got my first contract, my mum said: ‘I’ve got cheque stubs from when we had to pay for you to go play for England.’” Waterman, who is now a Guinness brand ambassador, and her peers have been part of an all-out revolution. There were fewer than 100 in the crowd when Waterman played her first game, and became England’s youngest player, against Ireland in 2003. It’s not long since the England team celebrated winning tournaments with a post-match meal eaten off paper plates at a park bench. But times have definitely changed: the profile and professionalism of the game has increased significantly, and the fact the 2021 Women’s Six Nations is being broadcast in its entirety means that many fans may be surprised to discover that a home nations tournament has only existed since 1996. Waterman was 12 at the time and, despite being from a rugby-steeped family, had no idea there was such a thing as an England women’s team. Three years later, at her first ever England camp, she was mixing with some of the most influential women in the game’s history. “I’ve never had that many female role models and all of a sudden I was getting to meet people like Gill Burns, who’s just the most iconic player for England. I was so in awe of these amazing athletes and their drive to be brilliant at the same time as doing full-time jobs. And that’s what stayed with me – their determination.”  It’s easy to forget that the women’s game has existed almost as long as the men’s. Emily Valentine who was born in Enniskillen, in what is now Northern Ireland, has long held the honour of being rugby’s first known female player – scoring a try in a team formed by her brothers in 1887 – but Lydia Furse, researching the sport’s history at De Montfort University in Leicester, has uncovered evidence that this was no isolated event. “In the same year in Hull there was a game with two teams of women playing rugby football against each other, but the game wasn’t very well received,” says Furse. “There was a pitch invasion and the players were carried off before it could be completed.” Victorian morals just wouldn’t allow for it and although a series of charity matches in south Wales during the first world war were positively received, when the men returned women were expected to retreat from the pitch to the kitchen and the laundry room, their role confined to washing the kit. When women’s rugby did finally establish itself in the post-war years, it was in an unexpected place: North America. Across the Channel, the game had been developing separately (and considerably quicker). By 1971, there was a French women’s championship comprising 22 teams, and France and the Netherlands were the first teams to stage an international women’s fixture, with the French side travelling to Utrecht to take on the Netherlands in 1982. France’s centre pairing were identical twins, Monique and Nicole Fraysse, and France won the game with a single, unconverted try. It was the 1991 Rugby World Cup that changed women’s rugby forever. Griffin, Dorrington and fellow players Alice Cooper and Mary Forsyth single-handedly organised a tournament that redefined the sport (while juggling full-time jobs, babies, and Dorrington’s role in the England team). No team could withstand the fierce athleticism of the US, with “locks from hell” Tara Flanagan and Tam Beckenbridge, helping consign England to defeat in the final. Three years later, several of those defeated England players enjoyed sweet revenge – including Emma Mitchell and captain Karen Almond at 9 and 10, who were pivotal in beating the US 38-23 to lift the trophy. But the follow-up tournament almost hadn’t happened – the International Rugby Board refused to sanction it, requiring a last-minute relocation of the action from the Netherlands to Scotland. For decades, women have driven their own game forward, pushed for it to be taken seriously and pioneered new roles. The formation of Saracens Women under Welsh international Liza Burgess sharpened competition and strengthened skills, as did the introduction of a home nations tournament, expanding from four to five and ultimately six teams. The US reached the Women’s World Cup final again in 1998, but it would be the last time they would do so – and their decline precipitated the rise of New Zealand, who won four successive World Cups between 1998 and 2010. The Black Ferns’ achievements were even more impressive given that logistics meant they rarely played Test-level opposition. Yet they consistently peaked in World Cups with a barrage of talent, from their brilliant hooker and captain Farah Palmer to long-serving fly-half Anna Richards and phenomenal try scoring wing Vanessa Cootes, who ran in 43 in only 16 Tests (nine of them in a single game against France). Meanwhile England have spent the past 10 years raising the bar of the women’s game, from the ferocious power of Maggie Alphonsi to Rochelle Clark, the most capped women’s player in history, and the kicking of Emily Scarratt, who led the Sevens team to a semi-final in its first ever Olympic appearance. And the Six Nations has become ever more competitive, with Ireland securing their first titles in 2013 and 2015, and Italy – who replaced Spain in the Six Nations in 2007 – a force to be reckoned with. Waterman believes that although the profile and professionalism of the sport has never been higher, there’s still plenty more to do. “It’s only the last few years we’ve seen an acceleration of the support, the facilities, the media opportunities, that’s bringing the sport in line with where it needs to be,” she says.

Argentina, which is rolling out an inoculation program largely around Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, has recorded over 2.7 million Covid-19 cases and has set a series of new daily records for infections in recent weeks. Deaths from the virus are likely to hit 60,000 later on Wednesday. A local laboratory on Tuesday said it had produced a test batch of Sputnik V ahead of planned large-scale manufacture later this year. Vizzotti said it was “great news” though cautioned it needed to be quality controlled and that the time frame would depend on how that process went. Carlos Camera, an Argentine infectious disease expert, said there was a possibility of health systems being overwhelmed, which was the cause of new restrictions that had sparked some protests amid a fragile economic rebound. “What was not foreseen was the size with which this second wave has hit and above all the speed of it compared to the speed we’ve managed with vaccinations,” he said.“President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced Wednesday, 27 October 2021, as the date on which local government elections will take place,” the president’s office said. The polls, scheduled for every five years and last held in 2016, allow South Africans to vote for public representatives at metropolitan, district and the local level. Some political parties had argued for the polls to be pushed back to 2022 once the worst of Covid-19 has passed.Flights to and from Leticia were grounded at the end of January over fears about the spread of the Brazilian P1 coronavirus variant, which studies have shown to be roughly 2.5 times more contagious and more resistant to antibodies. Colombia’s Amazonas province shares a border with the Brazilian state of the same name and the decision to halt flights came after a case of the P1 variant was reported in Tabatinga, a Brazilian city next to Leticia. “In Amazonas, particularly in Leticia, the projected seroprevalence is very high, which led the advisory committee to recommend reopening flights in its last session,” Julian Fernandez, Colombia’s director of epidemiology and demographics, said in a statement released by the health ministry. Seroprevalence is the percentage of iniduals in a population who have antibodies to infectious agents such as viruses. Amazonas’ population numbers just under 80,000 and the majority live in Leticia. So far, more than 50,000 vaccine doses have been administered there, according to the health ministry. Those looking to travel from Leticia when flights restart on 1 May will have to present Covid-19 vaccination cards showing they have received necessary doses, the health ministry said. Travellers must have received their second dose at least 15 days prior and show a negative antigen result. People who have chosen not to be vaccinated will face seven-day quarantines in hotels - for which they will have to pay - if flying to or via capital Bogota, the statement added. Spain is entitled to over 93 million vaccine doses this year under an EU-coordinated purchasing scheme, mostly for double-dose inoculation, leaving it with millions of extra shots. Top UN financial and vaccine officials last week urged rich countries to donate excess Covid-19 vaccine doses to the Covax vaccine-sharing programme supplying lower income countries, which aims to buy up to 1.8 billion doses in 2021.That’s all from me for today – my colleague Lucy Campbell will be taking you through the evening’s developments shortly.

Etienne said Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, Uruguay and Argentina are currently worst-affected South American nations, while almost every country in Central America is reporting a rise in infections. Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic are the worst-affected.“We expect decisions by the CDC and FDA on Friday and then by our national committee on vaccinations in the following days. Vaccinations will begin on 5 May,” said the head of vaccinations, Marios Themistocleous, . Greece had been expected to start J\u0026ampJ vaccinations on Monday before concerns emerged over reports of very rare blood clotting disorders associated with the vaccine. It then said it would wait until the European Medicines Agency’s statement before proceeding with the rollout. While the EMA said it had found a possible link between very rare blood clotting cases and the vaccine, it advised its use, saying the benefits outweigh the risk. The agency had examined eight serious cases of clotting disorders the US, which has vaccinated more than 7 million with the shot.Singh, 88, who developed a fever on Sunday and tested positive a day later, is an economist, academic and member of the Congress party who led the country for a decade between 2004 and 2014 and was the first Sikh to hold the office.

We all pray for his quick recovery.” The cumulative toll stands at 36,975, according to data from the health ministry. A further 61,967 new cases were recorded in the same period, taking the total number of cases since the onset of the pandemic to 4,446,591. Turkey currently ranks fourth globally in the number of daily cases based on a seven-day average, according to a Reuters tally.In a statement, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the confirmed case had “self-isolated and their contacts have been identified”. The testing will focus on the Alum Rock, Glebe Farm and Tile Cross areas of the city. Health officials said that the case is not believed to be connected to a case of the same variant identified in the Birmingham and Sandwell areas last week. The DHSC said that everybody aged 16 years and over who is contacted from the new areas, announced on Wednesday, would be “strongly encouraged to take a Covid-19 PCR test”, whether or not they are symptomatic. Residents are advised to continue using twice-weekly rapid testing alongside the PCR test as part of surge-testing.Prior to Tuesday’s additions, the department advised against travel to 34 countries. 131 countries are now marked as Level Four – its highest advisory rating. The state department said on Monday that the shift is not due to a reassessment of the countries’ coronavirus situations, but rather “reflects an adjustment in the state department’s travel advisory system to rely more on (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s) existing epidemiological assessments”.Despite evidence revealing that pregnant women may be at an increased risk of severe disease and losing their baby if they contract Covid, 984 pregnant staff in 25 trusts across the UK continue to work in frontline roles, a request under freedom of information laws by the campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed has revealed.

Since then, over 240,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,800 people have died.Globally, over 140 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 88\u0026nbspdifferent vaccines in clinical development, with another 184 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine. \u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top four cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3) and\u0026nbsppeople aged 16 to 69 who are at very high risk (cohort 4).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be\u0026nbsppeople aged 65 to 69 who are at high risk (cohort 5), other people aged 65-69 (cohort 6) and\u0026nbsppeople aged 16 to 64 who are at high risk (cohort 7).

Simon Coveney said on Wednesday that ‘at some stage over the next number of months I think you will see the benefit of the potential for international travel again’ There is “good news on the horizon” about allowing non-essential travel such as holidays abroad but any changes to travel advice will be gradual, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.He said the message was still that there should be no non-essential international travel but that may change over the summer months.Mr Coveney said the Government is working towards being part of the European Commission’s green passport scheme which will make it easier for vaccinated people to travel throughout the EU. That system will likely be in place in the EU from June and the Government will have to decide when to join that in conjunction with public health officials and based on risk levels, he said.Mr Coveney said at some stage over the coming months people will see the potential for international travel again. “I think that is still some way off but certainly that is where this is going in terms of facilitating international at some point in the future.”He said people should not be booking holidays abroad at this point and said any change to travel advice in the coming months would be gradual.Mr Coveney also said the Government will be cautious in easing restrictions when the Cabinet meets to decide on the future roadmap next week. “We will be cautious because the one thing I think the public won’t accept is if we start going backwards again on the numbers because we have come out of restrictions too quickly in an effort to give people too much good news too quickly.”“You will get in the next ten days a pathway of what to expect over the summer months.We are asking people to be vigilant and stay with us even though many people are frustrated and exhausted. The months of June, July, August and September will be months of progress, of loosening restrictions.“We need to gradually emerge from those restrictions with caution. We still need to be aware are living in a global pandemic, it hasn’t gone away.”He was speaking at the launch of the Government’s Be Summer Ready public safety campaign which is focusing on water safety.“We have had a really tough year because of Covid-19 and as the weather gets better and the days get longer it is so important that we ensure that we are vigilant with regard to our personal safety when working or visiting the coast, lakes, rivers or our countryside.”“Almost half of the population of Ireland lives within 5km of the sea and practically everyone lives within 20km of either the sea, a lake or a river. We also expect that this summer will see increased visitors to these areas as people holiday at home. So we are asking everyone to be alert to water safety.”Minister of State at the Department of Transport Hildegarde Naughton said as the country emerges from “what has been a most challenging winter of restrictions, we are all looking forward to this summer with increased hope and anticipation. I think it is fair to say that our level of expectation and hope far exceeds anything we experienced for some time.”She said given the restrictions on international travel there will likely be increased levels of activity on the coastline and on water this summer. She called on holidaymakers to “make a plan” before they go near the water, let someone know where they are going and when they plan to be back.Minister Heather Humphreys outlined how there are approximately ten drownings in Ireland every month as she called on the public to report any damaged or missing ring buoys to their local authority.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"coalition candidates earn comfortable victories in seanad byelections","story":"The vacancies in the Upper House arose due to the resignations of Fine Gael’s Michael D’Arcy and Elisha McCallion, a former Sinn Féin MLA and MP.

Fine Gael candidate Maria Byrne and Fianna Fail’s Gerry Horkan, both former senators, were elected on the first count as the voting pact between both larger Government parties held strong. Ms Byrne, from Limerick, won 118 votes out 202 on the Agricultural panel exceeding the quota of 102 by 16 votes while Mr Horkan won 114 votes out of 203 on the Industrial and Commercial Panel, surpassing the quota by 12 votes. There had been some expectation that independent candidates, Ian Marshall and Billy Lawless (also former senators) might run the Government candidates close, and both were supported by Sinn Féin.In the event Mr Marshall won 69 votes and Mr Lawless an unexpectedly low 52 votes, though there were more candidates (four rather than three) in the byelection for the Industrial and Commercial panel. Green Party chair Hazel Chu, whose decision to run as an Independent candidate, led to a bitter internal row with her party, won 10 votes, which was expected. While neither Labour Party candidates was expected to challenge for a seat, the party said both had performed strongly, with Angela Feeney winning 15 votes on the Agricultural Panel and Ciaran Ahern garnering 27 votes on the Industrial and Commercial Panel. In all, there are 106 Fianna Fail and Fine Gael TDs and Senators in the Oireachtas which was over a quota. The two Coalition candidates also won the support of some Green TDs and Senators and perhaps one or two Independents who tend to vote with the Government parties when the Dail or Seanad ides. Speaking afterwards, Mr Martin said it was clear the Government is strong and working together with purpose. “We had a Cabinet meeting yesterday at which there was a wider debate and comprehensive discussion about the most important long-term policies including the economy, climate change, employment and education.“It’s clear the Government is strong and has cohesion and is working together for real change, not just on Covid-19 issues,” he said.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillJust three of the 23 candidates who applied for the position of secretary general of the Department of Health, were international applicants, the Dáil has been told.Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Michael McGrath gave details of the recruitment process and said that the job was openly advertised online and in international media.He said 10 candidates were female, 17 came from the private sector and six from the public sector and three candidates were shortlisted, all of them Irish, before Robert Watt was appointed to the position.Sinn Féin public expenditure and reform spokeswoman Mairéad Farrell said the Opposition was told an €81,000 salary increase was necessary to attract international talent but only three were international candidates and the best candidate “was right under our noses”.Mr McGrath said, however, that “you never know who’s going to apply and the fact of the matter was it was open to any person around the world to apply.“I don’t think we should discount the international experience of the 20 candidates” who were Irish.Earlier, Mr Martin defended the appointment of Mr Watt after claims from Sinn Féin it amounted to a “stroke” and a “try-on”.Mr Martin said the appointment came after an “independent process” and it spoke Mr Watt’s experience and the Government’s goal of bringing “transformative” change to the health service.He was responding to remarks by Sinn Féin TD Mary Lou McDonald who argued that the appointment was a “kick in the teeth” to other workers and called for pay increase that brings the salary on offer for the role to €292,000 to be “cancelled”.Mr Watt, who up until recently was secretary general at the Department of Public Expenditure and is currently paid the €211,000 salary attached to that post, said he would not be accepting the higher rate, for the present.He has worked as interim secretary general at the Department of Health since January before the Cabinet decided on Tuesday to appoint him to the permanent job.Open competitionThe decision came after an open competition carried out by the Top Level Appointments Committee (TLAC).After his appointment Mr Watt said: “The proposed salary for this role is higher than my current salary. I don’t think it is appropriate to take such an increase in pay given the current difficult economic conditions the country faces.”It had always been my intention that, if I were to be appointed to this role, I would waive this increase until the economy begins to recover and unemployment falls,” he added.Speaking in the Dáil Ms McDonald accused the Government of signing off on an “obscene” €81,000 pay increase and said the €292,000 on offer is “ten times the salary of a nurse starting out at the frontline fighting Covid.”She claimed: “There was no process, no rationale for this obscene pay hike”.The Sinn Féin leader said that at the time the Government said it was necessary to “attract the best and the brightest to apply for this post.”She added: “But lo and behold, the best and brightest were there all along, under your very noses.”She claimed: “This is a stroke. It’s a try-on, and it’s a kick in the teeth to workers right across the public and private sector.”Ms McDonald said: “The incoming secretary general now says that he will temporarily waive this €81,000 pay hike but the truth is that this should not be waived. It should be cancelled.“The pay hike is wrong... and I’m challenging you Taoiseach now to withdraw it and to do so immediately.”Mr Martin said the appointment was an “independent process” carried out by the TLAC.He said it was “open as an international competition for anybody to apply and quite a number of people applied.”Mr Martin said Mr Watt has served in various capacities in the public service and “would be regarded as a senior, experienced, public servant.”He reiterated: “It was an independent selection process” and told Ms McDonald: “You shouldn’t cast aspersions on the inidual implicitly as you do”.Mr Martin said that salary increases have previously occurred for the roles of Garda Commissioner and HSE chief executive.He said: “one thing we are determined to do is to make a change in health that will be of a transformative kind in terms of our health service for the future”."},{"url":null,"title":"europe kicks off a conversation about its future","story":"The 27 member states never succeeded on co-ordinating their pandemic policy. File photograph: EPAIn future could figures like European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen be elected directly by citizens instead of nominated by member state governments and approved by the European Parliament? Is the lesson of the Covid-19 pandemic that there should be greater integration of health policy across the European Union? Or should the EU do less?These are the kinds of questions posed to citizens as the EU launches a mass consultation on its future this week. Citizens are invited to make submissions on the https:futureu.europa.eu online portal, which will then feed into citizens panels in the Conference on the Future of Europe that kicks off in Strasbourg on May 9th. The aim is to produce conclusions in 2022, with the possibility of treaty changes to reform the EU structure.The pandemic posed a dilemma for the bloc because its close cross-border integration meant infection roamed the continent, but health measures to tackle infection were purely the power of national governments.“If things had been ideal we would have always had a European approach when it comes to lockdowns, confinements and restrictive measures,” German chancellor Angela Merkel reflected this week. “When there are cross-border threats you do need to have a health policy that is co-ordinated.”But the 27 member states never succeeded on co-ordinating their pandemic policy. Even on travel, the furthest they got was agreeing to base their testing and quarantine rules on a colour-coded map – and the logic of Ireland’s quarantine system appears to have departed from that.Where the EU did move into a new area of joint action, on vaccines, the results were mixed. The United States, United Kingdom and Israel have been quicker in getting their citizens vaccinated. Across the EU communications went so badly wrong that the mass rollout of safe and effective vaccines for a novel disease less than a year into a pandemic – a miraculous event – was received as a series of mishaps.This is reflected in a survey published this week by the European Movement Ireland, in which 48 per cent of respondents said they did not have confidence in the EU’s vaccines strategy, compared to 45 per cent who did. Asked whether member states should give the EU more powers over healthcare to tackle crises like coronavirus, 49 per cent disagreed while 35 per cent agreed.The pandemic has not dented Irish views on EU membership overall, according to the survey, which showed 84 per cent support for membership, an identical figure to last year. It was higher in 2018 and 2019, when support was in the 90s, but polls continue to show Ireland is one of the bloc’s most enthusiastic members.\u0026nbspGlobal warmingThe support is consistent across region and gender, but there is an interesting pattern among age groups. In various questions, the youngest 18- to 24-year-old group and the oldest, 65+ group, are the most positive towards EU issues while the 45-54 age group are the least. It would be interesting to know whether there is a link to the experience of having a young family during the bitter bailout years.And what about the bloc’s future path?A majority of respondents said the EU was not doing enough to tackle climate change, and should do more to regulate digital media platforms. The poll indicated a clear majority in favour of increased EU defence and security co-operation, with 54 per cent in favour compared to 27 per cent against. That result was almost exactly flipped for the question on whether there should be more political and economic integration in the EU if it meant member states lost control over economic policy, such as tax.In the past, attempts at EU treaty change have run aground in national referendums. But the bloc is likely to face years of change ahead. Merkel is preparing to leave office after 16 years as chancellor, the end of an era for the EU. And the bloc is ided on some of its greatest challenges, particularly the retreat of democracy in the east.The chancellor’s approach to the issue has long been one of accommodation rather than confrontation, and when asked about the future this week her message was one of gradualism. When it comes to questions such as granting more powers to the EU, views were bound to differ and progress would take time.“We have to move forward moderately. Otherwise Europe will be ided,” Merkel said. “There are societies in which there is a great deal of polarisation because everything is decided based on a majority. If you want to bring everyone along with you, the quickest route isn’t always the best one.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"derek chauvin verdict what next for policing and race relations in america","story":"People celebrate as the verdict is announced in the trial of Derek Chauvin outside the Hennepin County Government Centre in Minneapolis. Photograph: Chandan KhannaAFPThe conviction of Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd has brought to a close one of the most high-profile trials in American history. But the issue of police misconduct and race relations in the country is far from resolved.Chauvin’s trial is a watershed moment in the history of American policing – the conviction of a police officer for an on-duty killing is highly unusual in the United States. Approximately 1,000 fatal shootings involving police happen in the US each year, some of which involve suspects who are armed. But only a handful of police have ever been charged with a crime.Those who are are rarely convicted. One reason is that police have significant legal authority to use force when in the line of duty – something that juries recognise and in many cases respect.The Chauvin case differed from many other police misconduct cases in one obvious way – the video of the killing. The cellphone footage taken by teenager Darnella Frazier, who testified during the trial, provided a vital piece of evidence for the prosecution.“But it’s not what I should have done, it’s what he should have done,” she said referring to Chauvin.While the emergence of the internet and videophones may have changed the dynamics of policing, many still feared that the evidence would not be sufficient to convict Chauvin in this case. After all, the beating of Rodney King by four white police officers in Los Angeles in 1991 was captured on video camera, but the officers were cleared.‘Errant officer’In addition to the video evidence, the prosecution successfully separated Chauvin’s actions from police conduct more generally. “The defendant is on trial not for being a police officer – it’s not the state versus the police,” prosecutor Steve Schleicher said. “He’s not on trial for who he was. He’s on trial for what he did.”The argument that a conviction would actually be a pro-police move by holding to account an errant officer may have resonated. The fact that several serving and former police officers also testified against Chauvin suggested that the so-called blue wall of silence may not be as strong as it once was.The country’s largest police union welcomed the outcome of the case, stating that the trial was fair, and “due process was served”. The practices at the Minneapolis police force, however, are now under federal scrutiny.On Wednesday, attorney general Merrick Garland announced that the department of justice had launched an investigation “to determine whether the Minneapolis Police Department engages in a pattern or practice of unconstitutional or unlawful policing”.This includes examining whether there is a practice of using excessive force, including during protests whether the police department engages in discriminatory conduct and a probe into the force’s treatment of people with behavioural health difficulties.This is separate to the federal criminal investigation already under way by the department of justice into possible civil rights violations by Chauvin.\u0026nbsp  The announcement came as President Joe Biden made it clear in his address to the nation following the verdict that the Chauvin trial outcome was “not enough”.“It can’t stop here. In order to deliver real change and reform, we can and we must do more to reduce the likelihood that tragedies like this will ever happen again,” he said.Sentencing guidelinesMeanwhile, focus will now turn to the sentencing of Chauvin. His bail was revoked following his conviction, and he was led away from court in handcuffs. He is being held in a prison in Minnesota, and is being detained away from other prisoners for his own safety, officials said.Judge Peter Cahill said a sentencing hearing will take place in eight weeks’ time.Though the most serious charge on which he was convicted – second-degree murder – can command up to 40 years in prison, sentencing guidelines suggest a prison term of 12.5 years is more probable for a defendant without a criminal record.However, the state is likely to request a lengthier sentence, citing aggravating factors such as the fact that the crime took place in the presence of children, that Chauvin abused his authority as a police officer and that his actions were particularly cruel.Attention will also turn to the trial of the other three officers who witnessed the killing. Chauvin’s three colleagues are scheduled to be tried in August on aiding and abetting charges, though their attorneys are likely to request that the trial takes place outside Minneapolis.In the meantime, however, the black community in Minneapolis are hoping that Chauvin’s conviction could prove a turning point for relations with the police.

But perhaps there was never going to be a decision that pleased everyone. Had the jury found the Minnesotan police officer innocent of killing George Floyd last year, the Black Lives Matter mob would have resumed their riots – if they ever stopped. Upon finding Chauvin guilty, meanwhile, the jury was accused of appeasing the very same mob by those on the opposing side of the argument.I have no dog in this fight. It was an awful incident in a foreign land. The shocking killing of George Floyd will have sent shivers down the spine of anyone who saw the footage. The issue I have is with the drama being imported to this country. Violence by American police is an American issue that needs to be resolved by Americans. Protesting in the streets of London about something that happened thousands of miles away, chanting “end police brutality” and “ACAB”, makes little to no sense.It seems we must remind ourselves that America’s race debate is not the same as our race debate. Laws enforcing segregation and other forms of discrimination were still in place in America as late as the 1960s, when the UK was beginning to pass legislation on racial equality. “African Americans” developed their own culture, distinct from that of many people of black ethnicity in the UK. When Afro-Caribbean people from around the Commonwealth were invited to the mother country in the 1940s, 50s and 60s, they by and large integrated into British society and embraced British culture. There hasn’t been the same ide in the UK that we see in the States.Black Lives Matter is a global movement that grew out of the outrage following Floyd’s death. Yet its ideological arguments ignore any differences between nations.By contrast, Tony Sewell’s recent Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities report took an evidence-based approach to examining inequalities in the UK, looking at the multiple causes of racial disparities rather than assuming racism. This upset many race-hustlers on the hard-Left of British politics who in their self-flagellation want to proclaim this to be an institutionally racist country. But when we move away from such isive rhetoric and look at the cold, hard facts, we see a nation that has thrived on building a multi-ethnic society with equal opportunities for all.This progress is threatened by importing US debates into the UK, thereby promoting an inaccurate and damaging narrative about race in our country. Divisions are stoked where they needn’t exist and where they often didn’t exist to begin with.Dawn Butler MP’s extraordinary comments in the House of Commons this week only further highlighted this point. In her response to a statement on the Sewell report, she used the term “racial gatekeepers” apparently in reference to the Commission and the equalities minister Kemi Badenoch, and accused them of “gaslightin’ (sic) on a national scale”. This is utterly disgraceful language for an MP to use in Parliament, and the Labour Party would do well to reprimand her for it, especially if they ever intend to reconnect with the common folks of this great nation.I can only speak for myself, but I would assume many ordinary people are fed up with this sort of toxic behaviour.

Nearby, police rushed into crowds who had gathered in an adjacent park and pulled people out.Berlin police confirmed that 152 people had been arrested by the late afternoon.The lockdown sceptics had gathered to protest a law which was passed by the Bundestag later on Wednesday giving the federal government powers to impose stringent lockdown measures on Covid hotspots.Chancellor Angela Merkel argued that the national law was necessary after state governments failed to consistently apply lockdown rules that were agreed at fortnightly lockdown summits involving Ms Merkel and state leaders.For months, different rules have been in place in the 16 federal states, leading to frustration among Germans about which rules they need to obey and where they need to obey them.Most controversial among the measures is a night-time curfew that would apply from 10pm until 5am in hot post areas. Also foreseen are reductions of private contacts to one other person outside one’s own household and the closure of all shops except supermarkets.The new law would “make it easier for people to understand the rules and will thus mean more people follow the rules,” Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said in the Bundestag debate.Opposition politicians have said they will now fight the curfew order in Germany’s constitutional court, arguing that it constitutes a disproportionate constraint on inidual freedom based on shaky scientific evidence. Germany is still in the middle of a third wave of coronavirus cases which have led the country’s intensive care association to repeatedly warn in recent weeks that hospitals are reaching full capacity.The new law still needs to pass through the Bundesrat, Germany’s upper house, but is expected to come into force at the start of next week. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"french winemakers ask government move front vaccine queue covid","story":"French wine tasters have urged the government to prioritise them for vaccines after dozens were left unable to work when they lost their sense of smell and taste after being infected with Covid-19.In a survey of more than 2,600 wine workers, the Union of France Oenologists said nearly 70 per cent of those who contracted Covid-19 lost their sense of smell and over half lost their sense of taste, affecting their ability to do their job.It\u0027s like asking a musician to play without his instrument, said Didier Fages, the union\u0027s director.As France\u0027s vaccination campaign picks up speed and workers deemed essential such as teachers and police officers get jabs, the body has written to Jean Castex, the prime minister, to demand that wine tasters be moved to the front of the queue for anti-Covid shots to protect their livelihoods.Tasting is at the heart of the profession of the wine expert who makes the wine. At each stage from harvesting the grape to bottling, the appreciation of the quality of the wine and the resulting technical decisions go through tasting, Mr Fages said in the open letter.He asked the government to consider measures to make access to vaccination easier, for oenologists.The survey added that 40 per cent of wine professionals whose senses were dulled during an infection did not recover their abilities fully. The loss of smell and taste, a common symptom of a Covid infection, could also affect professional chefs, perfume makers and others.Winemakers say subtler tastes are harder to detect after re-training their noses post-Covid, finding the aromas of dark fruits and berries are simple to detect, but those of mandarines and ripe citrus fruits are more elusive.France\u0027s multi-billion pound wine industry had already been affected by restaurant closures and lockdowns since the start of the pandemic. Exports to Britain and the US have been complicated by Brexit and by tariffs slapped on by the former Trump Administration.Then in April, a wave of devastating early spring frosts ruined as much as 80 per cent of vineyards across France, posing one of the greatest threats to the industry in years.The government had promised €240 million (£207m) to help companies stay afloat throughout the pandemic. Last week, Mr Castex pledged to put in place an exceptional billion-euro fund to help wine makers whose harvests were affected by the frost.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"italian skiver draws salary 15 years job never performed","story":"In a crowded pantheon of bone-idle Italian public servants, he took the biscuit – not to mention the pay packet, the pension and all the perks.  Public health worker Salvatore Scumace allegedly managed to draw a salary and social security payments for 15 years without putting in a single day’s work, costing the Italian state no less than €538,000 (£464,410). He was supposed to be working as a fire safety officer in the Pugliese-Ciaccio Hospital in the town of Catanzaro, in the southern region of Calabria.Instead, the man hailed by one Italian newspaper on Wednesday as “the king of absenteeism”, skived off every day.He was spotted in the hospital just once – the day he went in to sign his work contract, back in 2005.Italy has for years had a chronic problem with “ghost” public officials who either never turn up for work or clock on and then promptly disappear for the day, sometimes holding down jobs in the private sector.Mr Scumace allegedly maintained the ruse by threatening the directors of the hospital, saying they and their relatives would be hurt if they revealed the fraud.He was only found out when Italian police found an anomaly when they compared a list of the hospital’s staff with the shifts that they worked.After an internal investigation, he was sacked last September from the job he had never performed.The 66-year-old has now been charged with aggravated extortion, fraud and abuse of office. Six of his bosses face charges of abuse of office for not having investigated the alleged fraud.Mr Scumace was not the only skiver on the hospital’s books. Another 57 employees of the hospital were recently denounced for absenteeism and are under investigation.On the days when they bunked off work, they were allegedly seen playing slot machines, drinking in bars or shopping at the supermarket.In 2015, a town on the Italian Riviera was swept up in a scandal over absenteeism after it emerged that council employees were clocking on for work and then heading to the beach, to the shops or even back to bed.A months-long covert investigation by police found that up to 75 per cent of council employees in San Remo, which is famed for its annual music festival and lies just across the border from Monaco and Nice, failed to show up for work.In one particularly brazen case, a security guard regularly turned up in his underpants, punched his time card and then promptly went back to bed.The guard lived on the premises of Palazzo Bellevue, the council’s main office, enabling him to clock in and then return to his flat.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jacinda ardern now wests woke weak link","story":"Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s tiresomely woke prime minister, often complains that one of the biggest challenges her country faces in promoting its interests overseas is that, owing to its remote geographical location, it sometimes finds itself left off maps of the world. Now, thanks to Wellington’s naive decision to prioritise trade with China over its membership of the elite Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network, Ms Ardern can expect her country’s isolation to deepen further as New Zealand faces the very real prospect of expulsion from the alliance over its pro-Beijing stance.The New Zealand Labour leader’s preference for cosying up to China’s communist rulers comes at a time when the consensus among the world’s leading democracies is that Beijing poses the greatest threat to their long-term well-being and prosperity. It is for this reason that leaders of the other members of the Five Eyes alliance – Britain, the US, Canada and Australia – have been pressing for the group to issue a joint communique denouncing Beijing’s suppression of liberty in Hong Kong, as well as its repression of the Uyghur Muslims.This follows the alliance’s decision last year to expand its remit beyond its core role, dating back to its formation during the Second World War, of collecting and sharing intelligence. The network now also seeks to promote “shared values” on democracy and human rights. Yet attempts by the Five Eyes to present a united front against Beijing have been thwarted by the New Zealand government’s preference for maintaining cordial ties with Beijing.It transpires that, rather than supporting efforts by other alliance members to hold Beijing to account over human rights abuses, New Zealand has been reluctant to sign joint Five Eyes statements criticising China.Explaining the decision, the country’s foreign minister, Nanaia Mahuta, says her country is “uncomfortable” with expanding the alliance’s role, and that New Zealand should instead pursue its own bilateral relationship with Beijing. At the heart of it is a desire to forge closer trade ties with China, which presently accounts for 29 per cent of New Zealand exports.Wellington’s willingness to ally itself more closely with Beijing has also resulted in accusations that New Zealand is not fulfilling its obligations to protect smaller nations in the Pacific, which have been the target of Beijing’s expansionist designs in the region. However, by pursuing such a patently pro-Beijing outlook, Ms Ardern not only risks undermining Western attempts to present a united front against China. New Zealand’s reluctance to cooperate with other Five Eyes members raises serious questions about its continued membership of the alliance.This is not the first time that the country’s relations with the alliance have been strained. In 2003, serious consideration was given in both London and Washington to ending New Zealand’s Five Eyes membership after Helen Clark, the country’s then Labour prime minister (and Ms Ardern’s political mentor), ordered her country’s intelligence services to scale down their cooperation with Five Eyes because of her opposition to the Iraq war.Ms Ardern’s ill-judged preference for fostering closer ties with Beijing will inevitably reignite the debate in Western intelligence circles as to whether New Zealand, which has long been regarded as the weakest link in the alliance, should retain its membership.While New Zealand’s geographical location makes it a good listening post for the Pacific region, the country’s national security focus is much closer to home, and mainly involves curbing the activities of Maori gangs. The calculation for Western intelligence chiefs, therefore, is whether it is worth persevering with New Zealand’s membership when the Ardern administration has a very different set of policy objectives.Ms Ardern can also expect her pro-human rights credentials to come under closer scrutiny. Previously, Ms Ardern has declared her support for “the values of human rights, social justice, equality, democracy and the role of communities”. How this squares with her aspiration to befriend a Chinese regime that is persisting with its crackdown on Hong Kong’s democracy movement by detaining and imprisoning activists is for the New Zealand electorate to decide.What is not in doubt is that, by seeking closer ties with Beijing, Ms Ardern risks isolating her country from allies like neighbouring Australia, whose own trading relationship with Beijing has suffered heavily because of Canberra’s criticism of China’s attempts to cover up the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as its assault on Hong Kong.We live in an age when, as US President Joe Biden has warned, countries that value democracy need to work together to counter the threat posed by authoritarian regimes like China. By choosing Beijing at the expense of her Five Eyes allies, Ms Ardern risks eroding New Zealand’s credibility on the global political map.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mass covid screening obscene waste scant resources","story":"In medicine, as with so much in life, it’s important not to run before you can walk. Get the basics right and the rest will follow. If you try to catch two rabbits at once, more often than not you’ll get neither and end up falling flat on your face.The Government should be capable of chasing several rabbits but, as we’ve seen time and time again, this has simply not happened. Vaccine passports may be in the pipeline but how are they really going to be used when we just don’t know how long immunity will last? There are of course other ethical and practical issues. Mass testing is now being prioritised and is consuming gargantuan resources when the benefits are unclear.Original reports on moonshot testing estimated the cost at £100 billion. More recently it has been reported that every positive case found in schools is costing £120,000. Whatever the precise cost is, there is little doubt that it is eye-watering. Anybody can go on the gov.uk website and order dozens of lateral flow tests a week – are we sure this is a good idea, and even if it is, are there not better ways to spend such outrageous amounts of money?Testing vast numbers of asymptomatic people is an enormous undertaking, especially if this is going to continue indefinitely. Even with a tiny false-positive rate, there are going to be thousands of people every day being told incorrectly that they have Covid. Guidance has changed so a confirmatory PCR test is needed, but we are using some extremely blunt and expensive methods to pick up a tiny number of asymptomatic cases.These kits aren’t easy to use. We’re trusting millions of untrained people to push a swab far enough up their nose to collect enough sample. It’s an unpleasant experience. Can we be sure that they’re being used properly? On a small, targeted scale these kits are of use. At our Rutherford cancer centre network anyone entering the building has to take one, administered or overseen by trained staff. We’ve made a careful plan of how to ensure we are getting the best, most accurate and useful information out of our kits. Can the Government honestly say the same?Test, test, test – that now famous exclamation from the World Health Organisation’s Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesushas – has been taken a little too literally by some. Coincidentally, those people are also the ones running the country. Many public health professionals have aired their serious concerns, but the moonshot mentality persists regardless.Mass screening has always been a contentious issue in medicine. Over-diagnosis has been a concern for many and at a time when NHS waiting lists are bursting, thousands are missing their cancer diagnosis, the waiting times for heart operations are far too long and mental health issues are rife, there are surely better ways we could be using our limited resources.Forget mass testing and focus on getting those with symptoms tested, isolated and supported. Estimates are as low as 18 per cent of people with Covid symptoms are following the proper procedures. Even if it’s nearer to half, there’s the crucial weakness. Meagre financial help is available to some, but it’s pitiful. If you were a self-employed worker and the only way you could put food on the table for your family was to continue working with a slight cough, could you honestly say you would get tested at the risk of missing half a month’s work?Some would, but many wouldn’t. Politicians need to get their heads in the real world. A sizeable number of symptomatic people are continuing daily life and spreading this virus – there’s the issue. Throwing billions at testing anything that moves is an obscene waste of time, effort and money when the benefits are so unclear and there are other far more pressing issues to tackle.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"next derek chauvin","story":"Derek Chauvin was convicted of murdering George Floyd on Tuesday, in what was seen as a rebuke of law enforcement\u0027s treatment of black Americans. A 12-member jury delivered guilty verdicts on each of the three charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter against the former Minneapolis police officer.Mr Chauvin was handcuffed immediately after the verdicts were read and was taken into custody. Mr Chauvin, 45, could be sent to prison for decades - but we will not know exactly how long until he is sentenced in June.Under Minnesota sentencing guidelines, Mr Chauvin faces at least 12-and-a-half years in prison for his conviction as a first-time criminal offender. But prosecutors could seek a longer sentence of up to 40 years if Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill, who presided over the trial, determines that there were aggravating factors. He will consider that the killing was committed in front of children and that Mr Floyd was treated with “particular cruelty” during the incident, according to court filings by the state. With aggravating factors taken into account Judge Cahill could hand out a maximum sentence of 40 years for second-degree murder, 25 years for third-degree murder and 10 years for second-degree manslaughter.It will be up to Judge Hill whether the sentences are run consecutively or concurrently, meaning there is a chance Mr Chauvin could be in prison for up to 75 years.Mr Chauvin\u0027s defense team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the verdict, but is considered likely to appeal the conviction.According to legal experts, the former police officer could argue that the jury was prejudiced by media coverage and a settlement in the civil case brought by Mr Floyd\u0027s family, though his odds of success are slim. Mr Chauvin\u0027s attorneys will have to notify the trial court within 60 days if they plan to appeal. His lawyers then have months to review transcripts and court filings dating from the start of the case to build their arguments.A financial settlement was reached with the family while jury selection in the criminal case was under way, something Mr Chauvin\u0027s attorney Eric Nelson said had an incredible propensity to taint a jury pool.Mr Chauvin\u0027s lawyers may also cite Judge Cahill\u0027s decision to hold the trial in Minneapolis as a reason to overturn the conviction. The defence had argued it was impossible to find an impartial jury in the city, which was rocked by protests over Mr Floyd\u0027s death.Another potential point of appeal could be comments made by US Representative Maxine Waters following the police shooting of black man Daunte Wright. Ms Waters urged protesters to get more confrontational if Mr Chauvin was found not guilty during a visit to Brooklyn Centre, Minnesota, over the weekend. On Monday Judge Cahill called her comments abhorrent, though he also denied a request by defence lawyer Mr Nelson to declare a mistrial.I\u0027ll give you that Congresswoman Waters may have given you something on appeal that may result on this whole trial being overturned, Judge Cahill said.The Minnesota Department of Corrections said Tuesday night that Mr Chauvin was at the state\u0027s maximum security prison in Oak Park Heights, due to an arrangement with the county sheriff and the Department of Corrections. Oak Park Heights is Minnesota’s only Level 5 maximum security facility and is regarded as safest for high-risk offenders. It is highly likely Mr Chauvin will serve his entire sentence in the prison, although there is a chance he could also be transferred to another of Minnesota\u0027s nine state prisons. As Mr Chauvin was convicted in a high profile case and as a police officer it is likely concerns surrounding his safety will need to be addressed. He will be closely monitored and is likely to be considered a suicide risk, meaning officers will conduct regular welfare checks. Mr Chauvin’s cell could also be kept lit at all times. According to a lawsuit in February, eight prison guards filed a lawsuit alleging racial discrimination after they were barred from working on the floor where Mr Chauvin had been held at the Ramsey County Adult Detention Center, before he was transferred to a state prison.They claimed their supervisor believed they could not be trusted to professionally perform their duties around Mr Chauvin because of their racial identities. Now Mr Chauvin has been found guilty, prosecutors will switch their focus to the cases against three other police officers who played a role in Mr Floyd’s arrest. Tou Thao, Thomas Lane, and J. Alexander Kueng, who were all fired and arrested following Mr Floyd’s death last May, face charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.The charge is punishable by up to 40 years in prison, although sentencing guidelines can reduce the maximum to 15 years. The three are currently free on $750,000 bail and their trial is set for August 23.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pass first time wait 8 months driving test ultimatum piling","story":"Learner drivers have reported facing waits of eight months when booking tests and those who fail now face an average wait of 17 weeks to get a new slot.The backlog has prompted the DVSA to warn learners to only attempt their test when they are “completely ready to pass”.Learners are now complaining of feeling added pressure to pass, knowing failure could mean they must wait months to retake their test.Jade Bone, 24, is taking a test in Southampton on Thursday and is concerned at the consequences of not passing.“It’s going to be so long before I’m able to get another test if this one doesn’t go to plan,” she said. “That’s quite frustrating and a scary prospect, especially because it’s an expensive thing to do, having lessons.”Jack Hayes, 25, an AA Driving School pupil who is taking a test in Cardiff on Thursday, admitted he “really panicked” when it was announced that lessons would only resume last week.He said: “I booked (the test) back in October thinking there was plenty of time to learn before then.“I feel lucky to be one of the first people given the chance to take it, but I’ve had much less time to practise and prepare with my instructor.“There is also more pressure to actually pass than normal because the waiting list is so long before I can try to retake it, and more money would have to be spent on lessons to stay test-ready.”Only 46 per cent of tests in the year to March 2020 were passed, leading the DVSA to caution candidates that they should be “properly prepared”.The most common reasons for failing include not looking properly at a junction (22  per cent), not using mirrors correctly when changing lane or direction (17 per cent), and not moving off safely (8 per cent).Mark Winn, the DVSA chief driving examiner, said: “Learners should only take their driving test if they are completely ready to pass, and feel they’ve had sufficient practice driving on a variety of roads and in different conditions.“Thousands of people fail their test every year because of common errors which are potentially dangerous and avoidable.”Tests can be rescheduled free of charge if learners feel they need more time to prepare.Recent analysis found that the number of young people holding a driving licence numbers has fallen to the lowest level since current records began.

The average for a person using the calculator was 13.7 tonnes a year. More than 20 per cent of respondents spend nothing on clothing in a given month, and 10 per cent have solar panels. People who live there have a low carbon footprint across all areas of life, including travel and consumption, which could be linked to the rural lifestyle in the sparsely-populated area. It is full of wildlife, including seals and bottlenose dolphins.Dr Chris West at the Stockholm Environment Institute, University of York, said: The carbon calculator analysis showed people’s desire for a lower carbon future. Meeting our climate targets will require a combination of small and big changes, such as maintaining a reduction in international travel, which is needed to bring down personal footprints. “Changing consumer behaviours are a very important component of moving towards a low-carbon future, but these must also be complemented by a rapid transition towards renewable energy and a circular economy. The scientists also worked out the top five towns cities with a population of more than 250,000 which had the lowest carbon footprints.   Exeter, with 11.6 CO2e, was the best-scoring town or city, because more than 25 per cent of respondents sourced food locally, and 12 per cent had solar panels“Travel is another important area for carbon savings and as we come out of lockdown, making deliberate decisions to walk, cycle and safely use public transport are small choices that make a big difference. “In this critical year for environmental action, it’s vital that people also use their voices to ask businesses and governme nt to commit to the scale of transformation needed to tackle climate change and limit warming to 1.5°C.” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeons vaccine embarrassment highlights serious strategic","story":"Not that it is likely to make much of a difference to the result of the Scottish Parliament elections next month, but Nicola Sturgeon finds herself in a bit of a quandary.An online hustings event organised by NUS Scotland became the talk of Twitter as videos of a very rattled first minister were gleefully shared. What brought her to the point where she seemed keen to deliver a Glasgow kiss to her Conservative opponent, Douglas Ross? The SNP have been put on the defensive for their insistence that an independent Scotland, as a fully-fledged member of the EU, would have chosen to abandon the European Medicines Agency and the EU approval and procurement process for the Covid vaccine, and would instead have joined the UK’s rather more successful efforts. This, of course, is untrue. We know this not just because not a single existing EU member exploited the rules to go it alone, and not just because Scotland, having just achieved EU membership, would be vanishingly unlikely to side with the rest of the UK it had just abandoned in favour of its newfound allies on the continent.No, we know the true SNP position because they told us so. In the wake of the government’s decision to forego the services of the European Medicines Agency and pursue its own approval system for the covid vaccine, the SNP health spokesperson in the Commons, Philippa Whitford, said: “The UK is losing the European Medicines Agency – one of the great advantages was working together to have a single licensing system that licensed new drugs right across Europe.”That seems a pretty straightforward and honest statement about the SNP’s approach to the EMA. But last night Sturgeon argued that, since it was at least legally possible for inidual EU members to have pursued their own path, nothing would have stopped Scotland doing the same. And she is right, of course. But that is hardly the point. The point is, would they have chosen to?Why is it that the first minister now refutes what her health spokesperson said? Was Whitford’s assertion that a single system to licence drugs across Europe was one of the EMA’s “great advantages” wrong? Was she reprimanded at the time for saying it? Did Sturgeon herself rush to the media to disown Whitford’s comments and to demand that she be removed from her front bench position?Of course, had Britain’s approach to securing the vaccine proved to be the disaster that the SNP – and every other opposition party – predicted, Sturgeon would not have been put on the defensive. She could have smugly (but with more sorrow than anger, obviously) regretted the vaccine nationalism of the UK government and offered future, closer co-operation with the EU as an incentive to vote SNP in May. That’s politics and few other party leaders would have resisted the temptation to take advantage of such calamitous consequences arising from an unforced error.Instead, with the UK’s (and therefore Scotland’s) vaccine rollout programme soaring ahead of the EU’s, the first minister doubled down and asked her audience to believe that she was always on TeamUK’s side anyway – what on earth would lead us to believe otherwise?The SNP are not the only party to regret their opposition to Britain’s withdrawal from the EMA. But for them it’s a more serious strategic issue than the one that confronts UK parties. Sturgeon has pinned her entire political career on attracting those who voted No in 2014 and Remain in 2016 to her cause. She is beloved in parts of the London-based media because she has given the impression that she is, at heart, a fully signed-up advocate of the European project. Unfortunately for her fanbase, this is far from the case. Her party spent more money and resources on a single parliamentary by-election in Shetland in 2019 than it did campaigning for a Remain vote in 2016. SNP campaigners for Remain were notable only by their absence, for they knew that a Leave vote across the whole UK would suit their short-term political purposes rather nicely, so long as a majority of Scots voted to remain. Just as Sturgeon only discovered her feminist credentials after she replaced Alex Salmond as first minister in 2014, so she has only found an enthusiasm for the EU since June 2016. Her party opposed Britain’s leaving the EMA because it fitted nicely into the “evil Tories abandoning nice, progressive Europe and taking Scotland with them” narrative. And when that narrative turned out to be wholly false, when it was proved that ministers’ decision to pursue an independent vaccine approval process was the right one, Sturgeon found herself either having to defend the indefensible (the position taken by Whitford in the Commons) or deny that such had ever been her party’s policy in the first place.Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative leader, is clearly getting under her skin with his constant attacks on her, while the new Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, seems to be having a good campaign by ostentatiously remaining above the fray and condescendingly criticising both Sturgeon and Ross for being a bad example to children – a comment that further irritated Sturgeon. It emerged today that the first minister, usually so assured in her media performances, has opted out of appearing in person on a BBC Question Time Holyrood election special, while every other party leader will be present. This campaign is proving much tougher for her than most expected, even though she remains virtually guaranteed to still be in her job come May 7.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vladimir putin make major policy announcement ahead navalny","story":"Thousands of supporters of jailed opposition figure Alexei Navalny took to the streets across Russia on Wednesday evening in a final bid to secure his freedom amid reports that he was in a “critical” condition.Hundreds of demonstrators packed the main thoroughfare across from the Kremlin, chanting “Navalny” and “We need changes!” just a few hundred meters from Russia’s seat of power. Black-clad riot police put on a formidable show of force, with hundreds of officers in full gear lining the curb throughout the capital, but largely stood by and watched, a significant contrast to the violence of previous demonstrations.Moscow police said some 6,000 people took part in the protest in Moscow, reported the Interfax news agency. Russia’s police tends to under-report the turnout at opposition rallies, however. Other estimates on social media put the figure higher at 10,000 but attendance was hard to estimate accurately because protesters were spread across several parts of the city.However, the numbers appeared to fall short of the organizers’ hopes to match the crowds of tens of thousands seen earlier in January, the largest demonstrations in the country in years.The protests came as a group of UN human rights experts called on Russia to allow Mr Navalny to be medically evacuated abroad, saying they believed his life was in serious danger.The outspoken Kremlin critic has been in prison since he returned to Moscow in January following several months in Germany where he was evacuated for emergency medical treatment after being poisoned with Novichok nerve agent on a Russian flight last summer.Mr Navalny went on hunger strike three weeks ago after the prison administration refused to let him see a civilian doctor as he began to feel intense pain in his back and numbness in his legs and was finally moved to a prison hospital on Sunday.“Alexei\u0027s health has sharply deteriorated, and he is in a rather critical condition,” Vladimir Ashurkov, a close Navalny ally, told AP. He has been kept in harsh conditions in a high-security penal colony and denied access to adequate medical care, conditions that may amount to torture, the UN experts said in a statement.In a major speech earlier Wednesday, however, President Vladimir Putin warned the West against any interference, threatening a “swift and tough” response for any country that crossed unspecified “red lines”.“Anyone who threatens the core interests of our security will come to regret it like they never regretted anything,” he said in a 90-minute speech in Moscow.Despite condemnation from abroad, Russian authorities have escalated their crackdown on Mr Navalny\u0027s allies and supporters since his return.In Moscow, Mr Navalny spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh and Lyubov Sobol, one of his most prominent associates, were detained by police in the morning before the demonstrations had even begun.Members of Mr Navalny\u0027s anti-corruption foundation, which prosecutors are seeking to designate an extremist organisation, said the protests were a “final battle” with the Kremlin and could be Russia\u0027s last rallies for years to come.For many attending, it wasn’t just about Mr Navalny’s plight, but about the state of Russia more broadly.“Alexei is the person who has put the spotlight on the problems that have been in Russia for years like corruption. We can’t just stand by and do nothing,” said Leon, 35, an English teacher in a village 500 km away from Moscow.“I’m here because this is now the only way to express what we think about the government. Our courts and penitentiary system needs a complete overhaul,” added Olga, 46. The crowds who braved explicit government threats of violence were somewhat perplexed that the police were largely peaceful. Just 18 arrests were reported in Moscow.Thousands of protesters, mostly in their 20s and 30s thronged the city’s central area, lined with luxury stores and riot police, to clap and shout “Free Navalny!”, their chants echoing against the streets’ 19th-century mansions.“Anyone can be in Navalny’s shoes. I’m here not just for Navalny but for human rights,” said Kristina Yakovleva, a 21-year-old undergraduate studentDemonstrations took place in dozens of cities across the country, including in Siberia\u0027s Novosibirsk, Irkutsk and Tomsk.More than 400 people were detained across the country, according to OVD-Info, a group that monitors protests and detentions.In a speech earlier on Wednesday, Mr Putin made no mention of Mr Navalny, nor did he make a major foreign policy announcement that many were expecting. Aside from issuing a stark warning to the West, saying that “Russia’s response will always be swift, asymmetrical and tough”, he devoted most of this speech to domestic issues such as Covid vaccines. The rouble firmed after Mr Putin\u0027s speech, with markets interpreting it as not escalating tensions with the West.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dwp admit thousands retired women","story":"NewsDWP admit thousands of retired women face -year wait for crucial pension payoutDWP officials are tripling the number of staff to trawl through years of systematic underpayments to retired women - but it will still take until the end of  to sort outmirrorShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsDWP chiefs are hiring a -strong team to trawl through £bn of systematic pension underpayments \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer said he was forced to resign shortly after telling MPs campaigning for recognition of the Cold War heroes to “keep going” because “I am sure we will get there in the end. We will arrive at the right answer”. It came at the end of a Commons debate in which Tory grandee Sir John Hayes united with the SNP ’s Carol Monaghan and the DUP’s Jim Shannon to insist the veterans be awarded a gong. A review refused them one in December, on the grounds there was not enough “risk and rigour” for men who took part in  nuclear weapons tests held in America, Australia and the South Pacic between  and . What is your view  Have your say in the comment section But it took no eyewitness evidence and was loaded with people who had links to the Ministry of Defence. Mercer said at the time: “Whilst disappointed with their decision, I understand it.” Last night, Parliament was told that the nuclear test veterans’ service was “of inestimable value” and they now suffer a legacy of radiation-related ill health for themselves and their families. In , science established for the first time that survivors of British nuclear tests had similar rates of genetic damage as clean-up workers at Chernobyl. Sir John said: “Atomic veterans not only risked le and limb then, during the course of their duties, but those brave British personnel faced radioactive smog and searing nuclear heat which altered their very DNA… In the darkness of our ignorance, nuclear test veterans were drafted into a programme in which they stood just a few miles from apocalyptic explosions, flew through nuclear winds, walked through radioactive sand and drank contaminated water.” He said “the debt does not disappear just because the years roll by” and added: “The fruits of that mission defend the realm to this very day.”  SNP Armed Forces spokesman Ms Monaghan said the idea the veterans were not at risk was “obviously ludicrous” and that today “we would not ask any service personnel to do what they did, because of the danger”. The debate followed massive ratings of .million for Sunday’s Call The Midwe, which featured a plot about a stillbirth to a nuclear test veteran loosely based on the story of Sir John’s constituent, former navy chef Doug Hern, of Spalding, Lincs, whose lost two children to stillbirth, a third to cancer at , and a fourth has serious mental illness. Mr Shannon said the show had “illustrated the effect not only on the soldiers, airmen and navy personnel, but the families” and demanded to knowthe minister had wached it.Mr Mercer said he had seen the show and called it an “emotive production”, but insisted there was no scientic proof of a connection between radiation and subsequent illness.  The Commons heard recognition for the veterans had been blocked “time and again” by top brass and the “military establishment” despite cross-party support. Sir John said: “These men flew fighter planes through mushroom clouds and felt the heat of nuclear explosions on their bare skin. Knowing what we know now of the le-altering effects of radiation exposure, to state that serving in that environment did not amount to risk and rigour sufficient to deserve a medal is - I put it as mildly as I can - bewildering, baffling, astonishing.  “There is clear evidence of a legacy of heartache and of pain - literally and metaphorically - that spans generations. There is a legacy of cancers that cut great men down to size before their time, wives who suffered the unimaginable pain of infant mortality, and a generation of children born with le-altering conditions.” Mr Mercer claimed it was not within his power to order a medal but the Commons heard that RAF remote drone operators, Ebola volunteers, and Arctic Convoy veterans all got gongs after ministerial intervention. * Read the full story of Britainaposs nuclear weapons tests at DAMNED  Sir John told him the medal was “a bang to rights case” and went on: “It is time to step up for those who stepped forward when their country needed them... it should be our privilege to present our nuclear test veterans with an emblem of our gratitude for what was endured in the name of Queen and country. Not to honour these good and true people who served their nation would disappoint them, but it would dishonour all of us.”  Mr Mercer replied: “Those veterans made a huge contribution to ensuring the security of each and every one of us by ensuring that we had a capable and resilient nuclear deterrent during the height of the Cold War. I reiterate my absolute support for those service people and I pay tribute to their service.” The minister concluded his speech saying: “Awards and medals always have been inherently dficult and at times isive, but I am sure we will get there in the end. We will arrive at the right answer, and I urge my right honourable friend to keep going with his campaign.” Shortly afterwards he said he felt “forced” to resign over a new law that limits the MoD’s legal liability towards its own troops, and said the Prime Minister had “abandoned our people”. He also revealed that he had not had a face-to-face meeting with Boris Johnson since being appointed a minister in July , until last month. He said was sacked by text message after leaving the Despatch Box. For more than  years the Mirror has campaigned for justice for the brave men who took part in Britain’s nuclear weapons tests. The Ministry of Defence has fought back every step of the way. We have told countless heartbreaking stories of grieving mums, children with deformities, men aged before their time and widows struggling to hold their families together, all while campaigning for recognition. Two years ago we launched an appeal for a medal for the , survivors. For the first time we were able to prove some were unwittingly used in experiments. Our appeal was backed by then-Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson but his review foundered after he lost his job. It had only six meetings in two years. They never asked to meet veterans. They never questioned the evidence. Instead they asked for information from the MoD, which has a track record of denying what its own paperwork later proves. And as our medal campaign gathered steam, civil servants simultaneously withdrew public documents from the National Archives. Would anyone working in Whitehall today stay there, megatons of plutonium exploded south of the river  The test veterans and their families will never stop fighting. The Mirror will never cease to demand they are heard. Prime Minister, listen to them.

Lucy Stevens, , and Glen Carloss, , bonded over their love of American cars on their first date and even spoke about a shared dream of converting a big bus. Just a few months later they shipped the ft x ft yellow bus from New York to Southampton. It still contained kidsapos toys, discarded school jumpers and sick notes, and they spent nearly a year converting it into a mobile home. Out came the seats and in went heating, a cinema room, a bathroom, a fireplace and a king size bed - but crucially the iconic yellow exterior remains untouched. Videos show their entire process - and the months of blood, sweat and tears that went into the transformation. Would you live in a bus  Share your thoughts in the comments below... Lucy, from Addlestone, Surrey, said: We both shared the same dream of owning a big vehicle to do a road trip for a year or longer. Iaposve always be obsessed with Grand Designs so to achieve something like that, to totally transform something into a liveable home for someone, itaposs mad. We worked so hard on it, itaposs been blood, sweat and tears just because weaposd never taken on anything like that before.  How we achieved the look we wanted to achieve, Iaposm really proud of it. Lucy, a nanny, went on her first date to a rooftop bar in Southbank, London, with tattoo artist Glen in July of , and they quickly discovered they had a lot in common. She said: I told him about my dream of having an American school bus. Glen already had a passion for American cars.  It was absolutely mental, I thought he was joking - we both had the same dream! So, a few months after that first date we started looking into getting one. They found a company who helped ship the iconic buses from the States, and after one look at their yard, the pair paid £, to get their very own in November .  The bus arrived in Southampton four months later in its original condition - with pupilsapos names scribbled on seats and toys, hair bands, and handwritten sick notes strewn inside. Lucy said: It was mind-blowing to see it in person and to think about its previous use, and what we were about to turn it into. And it was huge, itaposs so much more daunting in real le but I absolutely loved it, I couldnapost actually believe I owned it.  The couple got to work with a full renovation - tearing out the seats and flooring before installing electrics, plumbing and heating and partitioning off the bathroom and bedroom. They spent another £, turning the old bus into a liveable space - the only one like it in the UK, they said. They added a king-sized bed, sofa bed, dining area, compostable toilet, indoor shower, fridge, hob, oven, work desk and garage space for outdoor equipment. The transformed vehicle also boasts a cinema room with a projector, as well as a a king-size bed, shower and electric fireplace.

If we prepare ourselves and talk about this more, we will be more prepared to support ourselves but also to support our loved ones as well, says Carina.  How to REALLY listen to someone whoaposs grieving Supporting a friend through their grief is important - but itaposs often hard to know how. Sometimes saying nothing at all and simply listening is the best approach, according to the experts. What it does is show the bereaved person that the relationship they have with the person who has died really, really matters, Andy explains.  How has the pandemic changed the way we grieve  Itaposs unlikely weaposll know the full effects of the past yearaposs events on bereavement, but it has certainly had an impact. People have been hugely imaginative in terms of the types of services theyaposve arranged, reveals Helen. Lots of families have said that they would be having a memorial service or some kind of event in the future when hopefully the pandemic is over and we are free to move on and that tells me something really important. Those families certainly donapost intend for their grief journeys to be over.

George then askedthey could buy some dinosaur slime – a popular school playground fad in Britain – but Mrs Daniels said she didn’t register a response from the Prince’s mother.

Landlords Sarah and Andy House were left out of pocket after the scammers targeted the Kings Arms in Elham, Kent, just days after pubs were allowed to reopen their beer gardens.Like other publicans they had been shut for months because of the coronavirus pandemic, until April  where they were able to serve food and drink to punters outside. The couple confessed it had been frantic coming up with a new way of operating and were suddenly liable for full rent payments, reports Kent Live.The challenge didnapost get any easier when a table of four left with without paying a penny of their bill on their first Saturday after reopening.Are you a pub landlord who has suffered an increase in people fleeing without paying since reopening  Email webnews@mirror Sarah was so incensed she took to Facebook to call them out.Her post read: Thank you to the table of four, booked in under the name of Josh, who took up a reserved table that we turned customers away from as standing room only. You were  minutes late, keeping the kitchen staff on, you received excellent service, food and drinks, however we will put your leaving very quickly before settling your £ bill down as an oversight, because we are decent people working hard to earn a living, oh and you left in such a hurry you might want to come back and pick your cigarettes up. The post sparked a deluge of support, with people calling the behaviour utterly disgusting to good hard working good people after a dficult year due to the lockdown.  To make matters worse, the table in question were not the only customers to walk away that week without paying. This meant Sarah and Andy were forced to keep peopleaposs bank cards as deposits when they take their table. Liam Jenner, a -year-old who lives in nearby Folkestone and used to work with Sarah at the council, spotted the post and decided to act. He went straight down to the pub and discreetly left £ in an envelope behind the bar.  KentLive tracked Liam down after getting his details from Sarah.He said: Sarah used to be my manager at the council a few years back so I’ve known her for a while and often travel to the pub to help her out by buying meals and drinks. I just thought it was very unfair that after such a struggle for pubs during the last year or so with COVID and lockdown that people could do such a thing to struggling businesses. So I thought her business could probably do with the money a lot more than I needed it right now.

A study found the average British home has  unused items plugged in and switched on at any one time. And three in  even have electrical gadgets on standby despite not using them in more than a year. According to energy experts, leaving a TV on standby can waste up to £ of electricity over a year. Across the UKaposs millions of homes, those with at least one TV waste a staggering £ million on unnecessary energy every year by leaving the set on standby. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section The energy intelligence report, released by Utilita, also reveals the cost of leaving other household items on standby. According to the energy supplier famed for its Energy High  education campaign, leaving a kettle switched on at the wall adds £. to an end-of-year energy bill. And even the microwave will use juice worth £. before itaposs even started heating something up.  A spokesman for Utilita said: The cost of leaving items on standby, or aposalways onapos might seem trivial per household, but when we look at the collective toll this behaviour is having on Mother Earth, itaposs really very problematic. Weaposre all guilty of it, so togetherwe all make a concerted effort to turn just one unused item off overnight, our planet will thank us. Households that have a printer, an item that is commonly left on, are wasting around £. in electricity every year, evenitaposs never used.  And mobile phone chargers left in at the wall - even when they arenapost charging - will use p each of energy annually - which can add up quickly for a multiple phone household. A thirdof Brits put their phone on charge overnight, evenit has  per cent battery or more, meaning they are paying for seven hours of unnecessary energy every night. And one in five have no idea thatan electrical item is plugged in, but not being used, it still uses energy.  Around four in of those polled via OnePoll said the main reason they donapost unplug items is because they just donapost think about it.

And Vickyaposs name is not the only notable absence from the cast list.  Kelly Macdonald who plays DSI Joanne Davidson and Gregory Piper who plays OCG member Ryan are also mysteriously missing. Interestingly, all three were involved in the late night meet-up at the lorry park that culminated in two gun shots being fired before the episode came to an agonisingly abrupt end. Fans have been speculatingthe fates of the trio have been accidentally sealed by the cast list. However, it appears unlikely the three will characters will not appear in the sixth episode of the series, hinting that creator Jed Mercurio is doing all he can to throw viewers off the scent by having the names omitted.  Fans have been guessing whether Kate, Ryan or both will end up in a critical situation orSteve Arnott and the AC- gang will get to the scene on time. Adrian Dunbar, who plays Supt Ted Hastings, caused a storm when he revealed some of the theories heaposs seen this week have been bang on. During an appearance on Good Morning Britain this week, Susanna Reid asked the actorhe knows what happens to Kate. I know... and a lot of Line Of Duty fans know, teased Adrian.

The annual Lyrid meteor shower is described as one of the most signicant showers of the year as people can see up to  meteors in one hour.The shower, which has stunned populations around the world for more than , years, will run from April  to April . But the peak is expected to be in the early hours of April .Nasaaposs website recommends you look out for the striking phenomena in the Northern Hemisphere between moonset and dawn so the moonlight doesnapost obscure your view. While no binoculars or telescopes are needed, gazers should seek to move away from the city to avoid light pollution and bring with them a sleeping bag or a blanket so they can keep warm during the spectacle.Lie flat on your back with your feet facing east and look up, taking in as much of the sky as possible, NASA said. After about  minutes in the dark, your eyes will adapt and you will begin to see meteors. Be patient—the show will last until dawn, so you have plenty of time to catch a glimpse.While The Royal Greenwich Observatory echoed this as it previously said: The later in the morning you wait, the higher the radiant will rise and the fewer meteors will be hidden below the horizon.But the closer you get to sunrise the brighter the sky is going to become so plan accordingly!  The Lyrid meteors radiate from the constellation Lyra, which can easily be spotted. You’ll want to look for Vega, which is the brightest star in the constellation. The meteors come from cometsapos debris exploding once it enter Earthaposs atmosphere. The cometsapos remains then disintegrate, creating fiery streaks in the sky.

Mr Brandreth, , suggested Philip wasnapost happy with the way the Royal Family was being portrayed and he would have thought the Sussexes should have kept to themselves instead of giving an explosive interview to Oprah Winfrey. The duke died aged  at Windsor Castle on April  and was laid to rest at St Georgeaposs Chapel on Saturday. The Queen turned  on Wednesday, four days after the service, marking the first birthday of her reign and the first in almost eight decades without her strength and stay. She spoke out for the first time since the death of her husband of  years, thinking well-wishers across the globe for the tributes paid to Philip which have “deeply touched” the royal family. Her birthday was due to be a private and low-key affair, with a number of events cancelled or scaled back as the royals remain in an official two-week period of mourning. She was expected to have lunch with close family members at the castle, though grandson Harry would not be among them. It appears he ed to his suburban Los Angeles home on Tuesday to be with pregnant we Meghan and their son Archie, who turns two in May.  Philip, who underwent heart surgery, was in a London hospital when the Oprah interview was watched by millions of TV viewers in March.Speaking to Dame Esther Rantzen and Adrian Mills on the Thataposs After Le! podcast, Mr Brandreth said he thought the duke would have given a blunt response to the interview, given one of the messages he preached to his children and grandchildren.Philip was interested in the philosophy of Carl Jung, the Swiss psychiatrist and father of analytical psychology, who found that his happiest patients were those who looked outwards rather than inwards. Mr Brandreth, asked about Philipaposs take on Harry and Meghan, said theduke was saddened that the Royals had become a soap opera.

He said: aposMy hope is that it all ends happily, but having interviewed the Duke of Edinburgh and written about him a great deal, I know that one of his rules, and a piece of advice that he gave to his own children, and I imagine would have given to his grandchildren, is aposdonapost talk about yourselfapos. Thataposs the general rule in le. He was interested… in well-being and mental health, and he read a lot of Carl Jung, the founder of analytical psychology. Jung looked at the history of his patients towards the end of his career and came to the conclusion that the happiest of them were the ones who are outward looking - people who didnapost look down and in but up and out. And the Duke of Edinburghaposs philosophy is look up and out, take an interest in the world around you, be interested in art, nature and science in the world around you.  Donapost think too much about yourself, donapost brood about yourself. Indeed, the Duke of Edinburgh said, aposdonapost talk about yourself, nobodyaposs interestedapos. And though he pioneered interviews, he was the first member of the Royal Family to be interviewed on television for example, as he said he was always talking about what he was doing not about who he was. The author added: So I think he would see risks in talking about yourself, both for yourself, and also because it then begs the next question once you begin talking about yourself - where does it end  And I know because he told me that he regretted in recent years that the way the Royal Family had become they were portrayed as a bit of a soap opera and that saddened him.

They said that Harry also got to meet his cousin Princess Eugenieaposs baby son, August, during the nine-day trip. They told the site: “This trip was to honour the le of his grandfather and support his grandmother and relatives. “It was very much a family-focused period of time.

The family simply put their issues to one side to focus on what mattered.” After the funeral, Harry was seen speaking to Harry and Kate as they walked from St Georgeaposs Chapel to Windsor Castleaposs private apartments. Harry had to sit alone during the service as Meghan was unable to fly following medical advice. Sheaposs currently heavily pregnant with the coupleaposs second child, a baby girl believed to be due in early June.  However she sent a handwritten note back with her husband, which was placed on a wreath from the couple at Philipaposs funeral. In a moving tribute, Harry labelled his grandfather the legend of banter and master of the barbecue. He wrote: “My grandfather was a man of service, honour and great humour. He was authentically himself, with a seriously sharp wit, and could hold the attention of any room due to his charm—and also because you never knew what he might say next. He will be remembered as the longest reigning consort to the Monarch, a decorated serviceman, a Prince and a Duke.  But to me, like many of you who have lost a loved one or grandparent over the pain of this past year, he was my grandpa: master of the barbecue, legend of banter, and cheeky right ‘til the end. He has been a rock for Her Majesty The Queen with unparalleled devotion, by her side for  years of marriage, and while I could go on, I know that right now he would say to all of us, beer in hand, ‘Oh do get on with it!’ "},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry returns home meghan","story":"NewsPrince Harry s home to Meghan Markle in LA as he misses Queens th birthdayPrince Harry is understood to have flown into Los Angeles airport on an American Airlines flight as he s to we Meghan Markle, who is expecting their second child this summermirrorShareCommentsBySam Elliott-GibbsChris KitchingSenior News Reporter:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video harry-chats-kate-william-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:CHKgpEkk,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

A study of , adults revealed  per cent have felt guilty for not always doing their bit - with large amounts of food waste the most common thing to feel bad about. A third feel responsible because they choose to drive a car instead of walk, while  per cent feel remorse for using plastic bottles. On average, adults feel guilty four times a week for not acting as environmentally friendly as they could. But  per cent keep their aposgreen guiltapos a secret and donapost even tell friends and family about their bad habits. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section A spokesman from Budweiser, which commissioned the research ahead of Earth Day to highlight how every keg, bottle and can of Budweiser are now brewed using  per cent renewable electricity, said: The pressure to be more environmentally friendly is huge, and people often feel powerless to act. The study also found that leaving electronics on standby , putting recycling in the general waste bin , and even eating meatwere also among the things people feel most guilty about. But while  per cent still want to do more to be green, almost a quarter admit to having a lack of knowledge around sustainability.  And one in eight lack confidence in making more environmentally friendly choices. Despite this,  per cent want a brighter future for the planet, with the average adult doing a sustainable act eight times a week. The study, conducted via OnePoll, showed  per cent feel there is a lot of pressure on everyone to be more environmentally friendly.  But almost one in six would be motivated to do morethey were praised for the little changes they make. Nearly halfstill believe that even the smallest of dferences have a big impact overall. It also emerged that two thirds reckon people should be praised for the environmental changes they make rather than being made to feel guilty for what they are not doing, with  per cent commending others for doing their little bit.  However, despite  per cent believing they are more environmentally friendly now than they were five years ago,  per cent still want to do more to be green. Sustainable habits that Brits plan on adopting in the future include buying an electric car, growing their own fruit and veg, purchasing from packaging-free stores, and installing a smart meter.

We hope this campaign will help others feel confident and inspired to join us on this journey to a brighter future.Professor Green has teamed up with Budweiser to create a aposPro Green Guideapos, to help inspire people about some of the everyday changes they can make to start living more sustainably.Professor Green said: When it comes to living sustainably, I believe we can all be more conscious of the decisions that we make and our impact on the planet.  We can all take small steps by considering simple things like the beer that we drink, the clothes we buy, the food that we eat, how we wash our clothes and how we travel. Itaposs great to see brands like Budweiser, who are now brewing  per cent of their beers in the UK with renewable electricity, calling out others for the progress theyaposre making and praising their efforts. I hope that in doing so, it will encourage other people and other businesses to take steps to become more sustainable and feel good about doing it at the same time.

And as coronavirus restrictions continue it is unclear who,anyone, will be allowed to mark this poignant milestone with her.Even the traditional gun salute will be silenced as the period of royal mourning for Philip lasts until tomorrow. So, as the Queen prepares to celebrate a birthday like no other, we look back at some of her most memorable birthday moments... First birthday What would you like to say the Queen on her birthday  Let us know in the comment section  The Queen spent her first birthday with her grandmother Queen Mary at Windsor Castle while her parents continued a y tour of Fiji, New Zealand and Australia in . th birthday To mark reaching double figures in , she received a miniature car, a bicycle, a big doll, books, a riding crop and furniture for her doll’s house. She spent the morning riding her white pony, Snowball, before an afternoon party. The teen years Turning  in , the young Elizabeth posed for a photo with her family at Windsor Castle. Royal commentator Marcia Moody said: “It was her first birthday since the country had gone to war, and the family portrait would likely to have been to remind the British public that there was a stable and reassuring family unit at the head of the country.” She devoted her th birthday to her duties and carried out her first engagement as honorary Colonel of the Grenadier Guards.  She inspected the soldiers with her father, King George VI, and later attended a reception with entertainers including Vera Lynn. As a gt on her th birthday she was given her first corgi, named Susan. st birthday Elizabeth spent her st birthday on tour in South Africa with her parents and sister Margaret. She made a speech dedicating her le to the commonwealth, saying: “I declare before you all that my whole le whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service.” Her father had made her wait until she turned  to announce her engagement to Prince Philip – which she did in July , three months after her birthday.  th birthday A set of family photos marked the milestone in . As well as a dinner for family and friends, the Queen hosted a ball for  people. A year later she celebrated her Silver Jubilee. th birthday  On the big day in  the Queen appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace alongside Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, who got married later that year. They were greeted with delight and , children holding daffodils sang Happy Birthday to the Queen. th birthday The big day came just months after Princess Diana’s explosive Panorama interview, and the palace decided to keep a low profile. Even the Queen’s planned birthday dinner at the Waterside Inn in Bray, Berkshire, had to be cancelled after plans were leaked to a newspaper. So the meal was transferred to Frogmore House instead. th birthday In  the Queen carried out a traditional -minute walkabout down the main high street in Windsor in front of crowds of , well-wishers. Prince Charles made a televised tribute to his mother, saying she was “an example to so many of service, duty and devotion in a world of sometimes bewildering change and disorientation”. Fans of the royal also showered her with , cards and , emails. In the evening she attended a black-tie dinner of smoked salmon, venison and chocolate cake in Kew Palace, which was hosted by Prince Charles. th birthday  In  the Queen became the first British monarch to celebrate her th birthday. Thousands of well-wishers lined the streets as a national service of thanksgiving was held at St Paul’s Cathedral. The Queen lit the first of hundreds of beacons set up across the country and overseas to mark the day. th birthday  Last year heralded a break from birthday traditions due to the pandemic. The Queen’s birthdays are usually marked by gun salutes in Hyde Park and at the Tower of London. But in , for the first time since she began her reign, they did not go ahead. The Queen was adamant that there “would be no special measures which would go against government coronavirus restrictions”.  Instead, she and Prince Philip spent lockdown at Windsor Castle together and marked the Queen’s milestone in private – with a slice of her favourite chocolate cake. Her Majesty was sorely missed by other members of her family. Royal author Leslie Carroll said at the time: “Both William and Kate are very close to their respective families, so it must be extremely dficult for them not to see them, and for their children not to be able to spend time with them as well.” Instead, the Queen enjoyed several video calls with family members. And as lockdown continues, this seems likely to be the case today, too.Queenaposs f avourite cake recipe Former royal chef Darren McGrady reveals the Queen’s favourite chocolate cake recipe that dates back to .

He wrote: I do not believe the Queen felt alone at her beloved husband’s funeral. She is accustomed to walking in procession and being seated on her own: she has been doing it all her le. She is Queen after all. She sat as she sat at Saturday’s funeral because of the current Covid regulations she would not have dreamt of doing so otherwise. He added to the : She leads by example. But she does not feel alone in the house of God – it is perhaps where she feels most at ease, for her a place of comfort and consolation. The Queenaposs love of her animals is also said to be a likely source of comfort to her - with Brandreth claiming her corgis and horses will help sustain her in the years ahead.She has already been seen walking her dogs in the grounds outside Frogmore Cottage in Windsor. The Queen and senior royals mourned Prince Philip at St Georgeaposs Chapel on Saturday after a funeral procession with the Dukeaposs coffin. The service came after the nation observed a minuteaposs silence for the Duke of Edinburgh. A handwritten note, reportedly signed with the monarchaposs childhood nickname aposLillibetapos, was left on top of the Dukeaposs coffin. Prince Harry and Prince William, who sat opposite each other in the chapel, have also been pictured together as part of the procession, and were seen talking after leaving the service.Earlier the dukeaposs coffin was loaded onto his custom-made Land Rover for his final journey. The Queen followed in a car behind the Duke of Edinburghaposs coffin while other members of the royal family walked alongside it on route to Windsor Castleaposs St Georgeaposs Chapel.  After the service, Kate and William paid tribute saying: The Duke of Edinburgh was a devoted consort to Her Majesty The Queen for nearly  years, from Her Majesty’s Accession in  until his death. The Duke of Edinburghaposs funeral was typically Philip and all the better for it, a royal author has said. Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty magazine, pointed to the quirky touches and very moving aspects, such as the dukeaposs carriage with his gloves, cap and jar of sugar lumps for the horses and the Land Rover hearse. It was a very fitting tribute and send off in the most dficult circumstances, Mr Little told the PA news agency.

Once someone wanted it I thought I better freshen it up a bit and give it a bit of a Febreze spray and take off the cushions to make sure nothing had fallen down the side. I put my hand down the side of the sofa and thought: aposOh whataposs that apos  Shirley was stunned when she found the -inch Rambo machete.

But whatthere was a way that could speed up the process or even allow you to skip it altogether  A mum has shared a simple washing trick she saw Stacey Solomon use to cut down on the amount of ironing she has.Emma Louise Cooper posted the hack in the Stacey Solomon Inspired Organising Clean Home Tips And Tricks group on Facebook, where she said: I saw Stacey do this once on her story and decided to give it a go, game-changer.Rather than pegging her clothes on her washing line or putting them over the airer, Emma put them all on hangers whilst they were still wet and hung them on the line. This meant that not only were her clothes wrinkle-free when they were dry, but she also didnapost have to think about folding all of the clothes away either. Explaining why she loves it so much, Emma wrote in the comments: For me and my family it is, less ironing, more on top of washing as more space on the line, kids easily put their clothes away, one is autistic and canapost manage to coordinate hanging clothes on hangers and itaposs now the weekend and I havenapost got a big pile of clothes to put away!  in our household and working - hour weeks so for me it is exactly that, a game-changer.

Three cases of the new highly ergent iant were discovered in people who landed in Angola from Tanzania in mid-February. Both countries have been on Britainaposs travel aposred listapos since January.According to a new research paper, the apparent new iant contains the EK change which can help the virus overcome antibodies.Scientists have warned previously that a new mutation could spread rapidly worldwide and even affect young people. The new strain, called A.VOI.V and designated as a iant of interest , should now be probed immediately, the paper, which has not been peer-reviewed, said. In comparison, the Brazilian iant has mutated  times and the UK iant has transformed  times.  The paper reads: While we have only detected three cases with this new VOI, this warrants urgent investigation as the source country has a largely undocumented epidemic and few public health measures in place to prevent spread within and out of the country. It adds that the group of experts behind the study decided to label the new iant as a VOI as it has mutations known to neutralise antibodies and potentially be more transmissible.Tanzania has had a troubled relationship with coronavirus, with it rumoured that the countryaposs president died from the disease last month.John Magafuli, , passed away from heart complications in hospital, a state address said.

He didn’t have much to do but he’s a very capable goalkeeper.“We are blessed with two very good goalkeepers and Deniz will move ahead with that now.“We’re a bit short now, obviously, but we’ll see how that goes.”With a Scottish Cup quarter-final against Aberdeen on the horizon, at Pittodrie on Sunday, and United sitting safely in seventh spot, Mellon would be forgiven for ringing the changes at Rugby Park.However, he insists, Deniz aside, it will be a very familiar starting XI that head for second-bottom Killie in midweek as they target #another valuable three points#.“We need to be careful because we will not, in any way, do anything that will go against the integrity of the league,# Mellon stated.“We know how important the result is for everyone concerned in it.“So we’ll be putting out a team we think is capable of getting us a result down there.“I’ll be expecting them to try to get the three points, it’s important to say that.“We have a squad of players here I trust and, yes, we have another important game on Sunday, but I can assure everyone we’ll be putting out a team I believe can get the three points.“We’re trying to keep the momentum of the club going forward.“We’re looking forward to going down and battling for another valuable three points.“We’ll go and attack that.”The Tangerines are on a six-game unbeaten run in all competitions, with the last two coming on a G surface #

He made me vice-captain at the club and I am always grateful for that.“Neil is a very good coach so I know exactly what he will be doing with the players up at Inverness.“I know the dangers he will pose with his team on us but our staff and players have worked on what we need to do to win up there.“We know how tough a game it is going to be.“But it is one we can into with a bit of confidence and try to win.“It is the business end of the season with pundits and fans all trying to work out what could happen in the coming weeks.“If you start predicting things and looking too far ahead, that’s when you can get caught up in yourself.“We don’t want to get too ahead of ourselves.“Yes, we knowwe win at Inverness, that’s us in the play-offs and the attention will turn to the weekend.“But first and foremost we need to get the result.”Kerr captained Dundee the last time they won at Inverness – a Scottish Cup match in  which saw the Premiership side run out - winners, thanks to Scott Allan’s winner.That proved to be Allan’s only goal for Dundee in his final match on loan from Celtic.Now, the mercurial midfielder is getting game time on loan at Inverness after recovering from a heart problem at Hibs.Kerr said: “I enjoyed having Scotty here. He is a very good player and I will shake his hand after the game.“But during the match I will be out to fight and win the battle.“He is a good player but at the same time we have lads who can combat what he has and he isn’t the only threat.“I was captain that night when we won - there.“It was a really tough game but got the job done that night so we are hoping for the same again now.“We will go up there with the right attitude and application to hopefully get the three points.”Starts have been few and far between for Kerr this season in his eighth season at Dens Park.However, it’s likely he’ll be used in place of the injured Jordan Marshall at Inverness tonight at left-back.With his contract coming to an end this term, Kerr is determined to take his chance back in the team.Whether that means playing full-back, centre-back or midfield – all roles he’s been used in this season.Kerr said: “If I get the No. shirt next, that will be me got the set!“It has been a frustrating season for myself in terms of game time.“But I will play anywhere for the team.“I wouldn’t say left-back is my natural position but I will go there and give everything. I have played there a number of times.”He added: “I am out of contract at the end of the season.“There is nothing as of yet. I will deal with that when the season is finished.“I am focused on the job at hand and then we will see what happens.“My job is to give the best I can on the pitch and hope there is a contract there for me.”The day Dundee played a home match at Tannadice: ‘We thought it was a great place to play!’\" title\"#The day Dundee played a home match at Tannadice: ‘We thought it was a great place to

from Dundee United tomorrow night – all their focus now has to be on the Scottish Cup.Micky Mellon’s men take on Kilmarnock in the Premiership on Wednesday.Then it’s a trip to Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup quarter-final at Pittodrie on Sunday.And I know which match I would be focusing heavily on.I wouldn’t pretend to know Mellon’s mind but I’d be playing some fringe players and youngsters at Rugby Park.Premiership safety is assured already and one bad result can be rectiedthey want to finish seventh.Measure up a seventh-placed Premiership finish and a cup run, though, and there is no comparison.Getting to the semi-finals – and maybe beyond – would cap what has been a very fineto top-flight football for Dundee United.The Dons will be tough opponents at the weekend but there’s no reason United can’t win up there.They’ve shown this season they can raise their game against better opposition and have done well against Aberdeen already.It’ll be interesting to see the impact Stephen Glass has on things at Pittodrie.They’ll get a bounce with a new boss in charge but I think it might be a good thing for the Tangerines the game is coming around so soon.The Dons scored twice at the weekend but they are not a free-scoring side.Neither are United, to be fair.But I see no reason why the Tangerines can’t get a semi-final place booked.Performances lately haven’t been great but they are still picking up points and grinding out wins.The victory at Forfar wasn’t exactly a classic but they got the job done and that’s all that matters in the cup.The same can be said about the win at Hamilton the week before – all that mattered was assuring Premiership football for another season.With that in mind, I’ve not too many worries about United at Aberdeen.Because they’ve shown under Mellon they can pick up points whether playing well or not.They also have men up front who are needing to get on the scoresheet.Marc McNulty will be thinking about where he might be next season and wouldn’t mind finishing off with some goals.And Lawrence Shankland most certainly needs to find goalscoring formhe is to find his way back into the Scotland squad for the Euros.Grabbing a key goal in the big Scottish Cup match at Pittodrie wouldn’t go amiss.I do think he will be in the squad this summer still.There is competition for him, which is why he needs to hit the goal trail.I said before the last squad was announced I thought Shankland had done enough to be included.Steve Clarke went another way so you never really know.But the only way for the striker to make sure is to fire in some goals in key matches.I wrote last week that Dundee couldn’t afford any slip-ups in the chase for second place.And last Tuesday showed exactly why I was worried.The Dark Blues played OK at Dunfermline but were held to a draw.And I fully expected Raith Rovers to kick on in their matches.Now they have a five-point lead ahead of tonight’s meeting between Dundee and Inverness.What a great position for John McGlynn’s side to be in.However, despite James McPake’s side falling further behind Raith, not much has changed for Dundee.It was always the case that they would have to win these gamesthey were to finish in second.And they’ve done alright against Inverness so far this term, beating them last month and drawing - up there earlier in the season.However, there is always a psychological barrier ahead of the long journey to Ross County or Inverness.And that means Dundee will have to be mentally strong to go up there and get the result they need.The good thing is they’ve been showing some mental strength in recent weeks with some good comebacks.Then it’s Raith on Saturday.SoDundee don’t get second place they can only blame themselves.However, I do have a good feeling about the Dark Blues – I think they’ll come good.This European Super League idea just sums up football right now – it’s all about money.There’s no consideration made for the traditional football fan or the history of the game, it’s just about squeezing as much dosh out of the business as possible.In Scotland, we’re lucky to still have local fanbases and you can tell when you’re at matches because of the atmosphere.When you go to English Premier League matches, it is sterile and there is a distinct lack of identity.This is another step away from that. Now the EPL is just a tourist destination. CALUM WOODGER: Whatever happens with Doncaster Micky Mellon has Dundee United in a better place and why Lee Ashcroft is Dundee#s Michael Jordan\" title\"#CALUM WOODGER: Whatever happens with Doncaster Micky Mellon has Dundee United in a better place and why Lee Ashcroft is Dundee#s Michael Jordan# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp calum-woodger-dundee-united-micky-mellon-doncaster-dundee-fc-lee-ashcroft embed # secretyDzMRFKV\" data-secret\"yDzMRFKV\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-memories-happened-city-tried-lead-way-housing","story":"IN , housing in Glasgow changed forever."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-memories-dior-models-rock-runway-1955","story":"RENFREW Airport had never looked quite so stylishhellip"},{"url":null,"title":"susan-baird-glasgow-lord-provost-never-forgot-east-end-roots","story":" GLASGOWrsquoS longest serving councillor of modern times and the cityrsquos second female Lord Provost was a bold and bright breath of fresh air in local politics.

Kosmische band Seas, Starry have released a four-track EP self-recorded during lockdown.The Anatomy EP was released on Friday April   in CD format on Ripcord Records and digitally on make-that-a-take-records.Self-recorded in the Granite City the release includes a unique collaboration with Unorms singer songwriter Derrick Johnston.A pioneer of the Scottish DIY underground scene Johnston appears on Nun The Wiser.Seas, Starry vocalist  guitarist bassist Claire Stewart said: “We have known Derrick for quite a long time through the DIY gig circuit.“As well as being good friends and sharing similar values we really like his vocal style.“Derrick has such an interesting voice as it is quite polyphonic with a lot of tones.“We had a song which we thought he might be able to put a dferent spin on.“We had the arrangement in terms of the music but weren’t sure what to do with the vocals.“We reached out to Derrick to see what he could do and he sent us back some vocal tracks.“It completely changed the whole dynamic of the song in a really exciting way.“That meant I was able to do something quite dferent from what I originally planned to do.“Collaboration has been really healthy for us.”Formed in  Seas Starry comprise Claire along with husband Jan Stewart ,  Chris Bissett #and Ross Macbeath .“I sent Derrick an instrumental version of the song and he said he walked around Dundee for a week just thinking.“Then he sent me a glut of vocal tracks – it was a wall of Derrick.#He told us to do what we wanted with it.#Jan Stewart, Seas, Starry guitaristThey have shared bills with similar envelope-pushing bands such as Dylan Carlson , Cosmic Dead, Happy Meals, Acid Cannibals and Hot Club de Paris.Seas, Starry have also played live alongside Dundee cathartic melodic punk band Unorms – fronted by Johnston.Jan explained the DIY punk trail-blazer fully embraced the opportunity of collaboration with Seas, Starry.He said: “I sent Derrick an instrumental version of the song and he said he walked around Dundee for a week just thinking.“Then he sent me a glut of vocal tracks – it was a wall of Derrick.#He told us to do what we wanted with it.“He was so enthusiastic and curious to see how it turned out.#We are really pleased with how it worked.#Seas, Starry have released two full- albums so far with debut Tyto Albainfluenced by My Bloody Valentine and LaBradford.Recorded over  intense hours follow up Triangle Teethwas far more discordant and aggressive.New release The Anatomy EP has the noisy, immediate rush of punk with tracks like Nun the Wiser alongside the cinematic pysch of tracks Skull Tone Skull and New Ruins.Jan said: “There was a period during the restrictions where two households were allowed to meet.“That meant we could meet at our rehearsal space and since Claire and I are married we could get one of the others in.“Then we could track it and then share things online to get it finalised.“It was all done ourselves  # just DIY.“When we had a bit recorded we would sent it off to the other guys and wouldn’t really know what was coming back.“They would sit at home and think about what they wanted to do.“With the songs we hadn’t yet properly arranged or fleshed out it allowed them to take completely new directions.“We might try to do that sort of things in the future.“Previously we would just be in a room trying to come up with dferent things on the spot and then worked on them organically.“However having this time away was almost like taking a step back and looking at everything which was quite good.“In the past someone would come in with an idea and we would play it for however many hours and decideit was good or not.“With this, we bounced off each other in a completely dferent way.” As well as the two full- albums Tyto Alba and Triangle Teeth the ground-breaking four-piece have also recorded a number of EP#s.“Knowing a lot more about the recording process has helped us as a band as well.“We are a lot more clued up on what sounds or dynamics we want when recording.#Claire Stewart, Seas Starry vocalist, guitarist, bassist.Released in October  Spooky Witch is a vital two track Ep whilst Yell Soundz is a collection of home recordings inspired by minimalist Steve Reich who composed influential pieces Dferent Trains and Music for  Musicians.The sound of Seas, Starry has developed and mutated considerably since their debut show a decade ago.Claire explained: #We have progressed because I think there is stronger songwriting.“We have pared back as we had a lot of pedals back then but have since simplied the equipment we use.“That has been good because it makes us focus on what we are using and why.“There is maybe a little bit less whistles and bells.“Christian’s drum style is a lot more direct and aggressive which suits us.“Knowing a lot more about the recording process has helped us as a band as well.“We are a lot more clued up on what sounds or dynamics we want when recording.#Jan believes a change in the band dynamic in recent years has been fundamental to Seas, Starry development.Each musician brings something unique to the band both in terms of sound and ideas.Jan explained: #One of the biggest dferences from when we first started was that the band was essentially ideas I had that were fleshed out.“Now it really is four people and much more collaborative rather than me coming in with ideas and little four-track demos.“Now pretty much everything is worked out in a room together and that makes the band sound completely dferent.“Everyone has an input and we all appreciate what everyone brings to the band.“There is a really good mix and chemistry.#Claire and Jan have been at the forefront of the Aberdeen DIY music scene for years by running concerts as Laika Come Home Music Promotions.There have been no concerts for more than a year since venues shut last March due to the coronavirus outbreak.There is light at the end of the tunnel as venues are beginning to book, and announce, concerts for the future in the hope lockdown restrictions will ease enough to allow audiences inside venues.Jan said: “Even before the pandemic Aberdeen was suffering a little bit as there was never a venue that replaced Downstairs.“There are still good promoters in Aberdeen as there is IMP ,  Punch Face  Champion and AGPwho are all putting on gigs.“In terms of when things start up again, I am concerned that what we will be left with will be larger venues that are attached to larger booking agents.“Meaning that you have to be in with a larger booking agent so there might be less chance for smaller bands to get a leg up.“My concern is that it becomes more corporatized when things get up and going again.“Limiting opportunities for DIY younger bands.“Unfortunately what we might see is the balance power sht even more towards these larger booking agents.“You might not be able to get remunerated in a fair way or there can be awful  deals.“All these things that may mean the smaller bands and smaller venues will suffer.”mdash Seas,Starry 🇪🇺🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇮🇪March ,  There have been green shoots of recovery for the live music scene in Aberdeen with the Blue Lamp recently running regular online shows.In a positive light there are promoters in Aberdeen that are doing really positive things.“For example The Blue Lamp have started putting on virtual gigs.“We have been asked  to do one of those which we are very excited about.#Claire Stewart, Seas, Starry vocalist, guitarist, bassist.Already artists including Craig John Davidson, The Ghost Tape, Moons of Mercury and Doghouse Roses have been involved.The shows are performed under strict Covid- guidelines with no audience and later streamed.The Blue Lamp also did pre-recorded streams to great success, and acclaim, during the Aberdeen Jazz Festival last month including a show from legend Tommy Smith.Claire said: #In a positive light there are promoters in Aberdeen that are doing really positive things.“For example, The Blue Lamp has started putting on virtual gigs.“We have been asked to do one of those which we are very excited about.“We are also excited to see the iety of other bands in the city that are jumping on that  that the Blue Lamp has provided.#It is exciting.“It is not all doom and gloom and there are pockets where people are trying to do their best.#The Anatomy EP is out now on CD via Ripcord Records.It can also be purchased for digital download from make-that-a-take-records. For as little as £. a month you can access all of our

have frustrated our natural desire to “get away from it all”, recent announcements suggest that holidays and travel may become part of our lives once again. To whet your appetite, let’s escape to some exotic destinations with local artist James McBey.McBeywas an Aberdeenshire-born etcher, draughtsman and painter. Born in Newburgh, McBey was self-taught, learning about art from library books.After reading about etching, he focused on printmaking, but with no printing press available, he produced his first etching using a domestic mangle. vw, px\"  McBey rose to become one of the most important printmakers in Britain during the th Century. Aberdeen Archives, Art Gallery and Museums holds the world’s largest archive of his work.By , McBey had abandoned his job in a local bank and launched his artistic career by travelling to the Netherlands. It was while he was there that he realised the merits of using antique papers with their soft, velvety texture and he ed with two sketchbooks filled with pen drawings and small oil paintings. vw, px\"  McBey moved to London in , later visiting Spain where he created seven etchings about bull fighting. In the same year, McBey’s first exhibition of prints in London was a huge success and confirmed his place in the art world.Working towards his next exhibition, McBey visited Morocco in . His love of travel was strengthened still further during the First World War when serving as an official war artist in the Middle East with the Egyptian Expeditionary Force.After touring and living in Europe and America, he and his we, Marguerite, were lured back to settle in Morocco because of their fascination with the place and its people.There is incredible depth and vitality in McBey’s realistic interpretations. I am always amazed by his subtle application of light and shade. His pictures make me want to discover Venice, New York or some other faraway destination all for myself.Why not feel inspired to see other locations and works by James McBey online at aberdeencity.gov.uk AAGMFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/04/P2_3_36128247-scaled-4-300x180.jpg class=attachment-part-medium size-part-medium wp-post-image ","title":"coronavirus in scotland track the spread in these charts and maps2001","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remWe#ve put together a collection of daily updated charts and maps to track the coronavirus crisis in Scotland. The table below shows an at-a-glance view of the situation in each local authority. It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began. After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus. The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-. Use the dropdown to navigate to your health board. The chart below shows the number of new tests reported each day. This figure shows all tests carried out, regardless of the result.In October, Public Health Scotland released testing data at a regional level.

This is mainly due to massive insecticide use and habitat loss caused by intensication of agriculture.Up to  per cent of flowering plants and  per cent of commercial crops require insects for pollination, with honeybees and hoverflies most often doing the job.But with declining numbers of these species, farmers may employ hives of bees to prevent crop yields falling.Wild honeybees forage within three miles of their nest, and onthey perform the #waggle dance# that advertises the location of productive foraging sites to other bees. Also, odours from scented flowers picked up inside the nest while unloading pollen act as cues to guide nest-mates to specic flowers.Now scientists have articially imprinted bees with flower odours in an attempt to improve crop yields*.In trying to establish long-term memory for flower odours, the scientists offered bees in three separate groups of hives alternative odours:  sucrose solution scented with synthetic sunflower odours,  sucrose solution scented with jasmine odours,  sucrose solution alone. They then relocated the hives to a sunflower plantation and compared the foraging activities of bees exposed to the three solutions.First, scientists decoded waggle dances to identy sunflower-specic dances. Using this information, they observed bees from hives fed with sunflower odours performing sunflower dances one hour after hive relocation.Contrastingly, the control bees fed jasmine odours took - hours and control sucrose-fed bees took  hours to perform sunflower dances.This resulted in the sunflower odour-imprinted bees performing signicantly more sunflower-specic waggle dances during the first day of relocation, peaking at  per cent increase over control hives preferentially visiting sunflowers and bringing in more sunflower pollen loads than the control bees.The scientists then measured the all-important crop yields in five plots containing dferent sunflower hybrid plants pollinated by sunflower odour-imprinted compared to control bees.Seed yields in all five plots were highest when pollinated by sunflower odour-fed bees, with increased production up to  per cent above control bees.They conclude that providing bees pre-programmed to forage on specic crops could circumvent wild pollinator shortages and signicantly increase crop yields.*Current Biology , -.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tons of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m stated by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast-track decision making.John Gurr  Sir,I heard that there was work going on in Lochgilphead town centre, and that some people were complaining, about mess and upheaval. No change there then!When I observed the work, I was so surprised at the dference this will make to the town and to the moaners I say #you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs#.When I spoke to them, the workforce were polite and commented that they were looking forward to the end result.For too long now Lochgilphead has been the Cinderella of Argyll and Bute now it seems she will go to the Ball.From a very satisfied resident.Name and address suppliedSir,Just ahead of WWF’S Earth Hour last year, the country was put into lockdown due to the Covid- pandemic. As we look ahead to this year’s event on Saturday March  at .pm, many of us are reflecting on the future, as we emerge from the latest, and hopefully last #stay at home# period.With that in mind, we are asking people to use Earth Hour by helping us to create the #Great Scottish Canvas#. Switch off your lights and by candlelight or torchlight, use the hour to paint a picture, craft a poem, doodle or write something which illustrates the future Scotland you want to live in.With so many eyes on Scotland this year, due to Scottish Parliament elections in May and the vital COP climate talks in November, we want to show the world the vision of the Scottish people, for a greener and fairer society for us all. Find out more at the www.wwf.org.uk website.I look forward to seeing the things you believe will make Scotland a better place, perhaps changing the way we heat our homes, how we travel around our towns and cities, or even how we grow the food we eat.Lang Banks, director, WWF Scotland, EdinburghSir,Tuesday March  marked the anniversary of the day the UK entered lockdown. We have lived through what is probably the most extraordinary year in most people#s letimes.Blind and partially sighted people have had to adjust, like everyone , to the daily challenges this  has created. Thankfully, there#s now light at the end of the tunnel. But some ongoing measures could continue to be barriers to their independence and confidence.People with sight loss can sometimes find it dficult to judge space, so we’re asking everyone to maintain their own distance, be patient and be helpful.Just getting out and about can be more hazardous for those without sight. The government#s #Spaces for People# initiative has already transformed many of our streets and thoroughfares. We must take care that this doesn#t inadvertently create new obstacles for those with disabilities.Let#s make one positive legacy of this crisis a resolve to make sure we re-emerge as a society in which no one is left at the margins.James Adams, director, Royal National Institute of Blind PeopleScotland, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures march 26 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

While saving in some areas of expenditure, it has incurred extra costs in tackling the pandemic and faces an uncertain funding future while the national economy tries to recover. The drive to save money in services where bringing in a little more through, for example, parking fees and fines, is understandable up to a point.But when the economy is on le support after a pandemic, surely the relatively paltry sums to be made are not worth the potential damage to Inveraray#s recovery, as seems to be the view of locals Perhaps councillors could look at this a little dferently. If they are determined to push this through for control traffic purposes, why not donate the proceeds, which would be a by-product of well-behaved traffic, to the town  The pier fund could certainly use it. Both the community council and Inspire Inveraray would no doubt welcome the cash and find many uses for public benefit.Just a thought.Congratulations to Cameron on his award. This is a huge achievement among a group of young people who each work hard for others.It is also  a great achievement for MacLeod Construction to be shortlisted for a national award. We wish them all the best in the final decision.We also wish Shona Brechin a long and happy retirement after many, many knots tied and wedding day smiles created."},{"url":null,"title":"vice presidents win the day at tarbert opener","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

However, on further reading, this was yet another unsurprising disappointment. The preferred corridor through Glen Croe is still to be announced and there is still no timetable for completion.Landslips at the Rest and be Thankful have frequently seen much of Argyll isolated from central Scotland, or journeys delayed by endless roadworks or convoys along the old military road. Most of these problems have occurred during the SNP’s  years in government and the continued failure to provide a permanent solution is yet more proof of how little the SNP cares about or understand the needs of people and businesses outside the central belt.It was clear long ago that patchwork schemes were not a solution but, rather than provide a new corridor which would have resulted in major capital expenditure, tens of millions of pounds have instead been wasted on years of ineffective schemes which nature evades in next to no time.In the meantime, the SNP has had no dficulty finding money to prop up central belt vanity projects like the Edinburgh trams.Mike Russell, SNP MSP for Argyll and Bute, has been far more concerned with Indyref and Brexit than the day to day concerns of his constituents and has done nothing to ensure that providing a reliable road connection to Argyll is a top priority for Michael Matheson, the Cabinet Secretary for Transport.The Holyrood elections on May  are an ideal opportunity for the residents and business owners in Argyll, whose daily lives are affected by such an unreliable road, to voice their dissatisfaction and vote for anyone other than the SNP or the Greens who oppose any road building on principle.A dferent government might not guarantee a speedy resolution, but after  years of failed sticking-plaster attempts to patch up the existing road, it certainly couldn’t be worse.Donald McCallum, Strathaven.Sir,Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signage.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples. In my opinion in the future Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs.Road signs help to regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important previews, especially during night-time conditions.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I write further to correspondence on Lochgilphead#s expensive new pavements.When they are finally finished, could somebody seethey have a bucket or two of tarry stones left over that could be chucked into the tank trap that passes for a roundabout, next to the Tesco garage David Hay, MinardSir,I have immense pleasure in communicating to your readers our new address following our successful relocation of our main office premises.Our email, website and telephone numbers remain the same as before.Email: info@abcab.org.uk and phone  .We have had no break in service and continue to provide advice and support to clients across Argyll and Bute, with our advisers all working from home under current government guidance.We are also available to provide advice to those who find themselves in a vulnerable position and require face-to-face advice by appointment in our Helensburgh and Lochgilphead offices.We commence our second volunteer adviser training programme next month and look forward to welcoming our new trainees.Jen Broadhurst, Bureau Manager, Argyll and Bute Citizens Advice BureauSir,Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year. Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.James O’Connell, Unite regional officer for Scotland.Sir,I work for a TV company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who are wanting to live a simpler le.

The disciples were huddled indoors in fear of their lives when suddenly the resurrected Jesus was there among them.Thomas hadn#t been with the others when it happened. He just could not bring himself to believe without seeing him for himself. Thomas gets a bad press because of this.We often react to this wee excerpt from Thomas#s story aswe would have been less reluctant to believe. We carry our willingness to believe as a badge of faith. Poor old Doubting Thomas.But is doubt a weakness  Or is it simply an opportunity, a space, a fertile ground in which faith might grow and ultimately blossom A week later, the disciples were gathered again in the same house where they had last seen Jesus. This time, Thomas was with them. Once again, Jesus came and stood among them. He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side. Do not doubt but believe.#Jesus#s words are aimed not only at Thomas, but at everyone who encounters this story, and struggles to believe that God is capable of doing the very thing that God has promised — call our world into new and unending, resurrected le.#Do not doubt but believe.#"},{"url":null,"title":"american dream continues for bob","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

You can also plant the first early potatoes, weather dependent.For beginners, some of the easiest fruits to grow are berries. Strawberries and blueberries love containers or open ground and both will crop heavily once established.A simple garden solution for April is to create your very own veg patch. Mark out the area well, prepare the soil, dig in compost and then sow a iety of seeds that will provide you with veg all year round.It’s a common misconception that you need a lot of space to be able to grow vegetables. You can still achieve real success with container grown plants. Tomatoes will thrive in pots and grow bags and can also be grown in the ground.Another plant that loves container leis Lavender – and it’s the perfect time to plant it so that you can enjoy it throughout the summer. It’s a favourite with gardeners not just for its beautul form and fragrance but also because it attracts essential pollinators such as bees and butterflies.It’s considered a romantic flower that most gardeners get the urge to plant in their garden sooner or later and can add real value with its scent and shades of purple flowers and silver leaf backdrop. To successfully grow lavender, it needs to be planted in a warm, well drained soil with full sun. It is often planted as an edging plant with roses or grown as an informal hedge. However, lavender does not like ‘wet feet’ as it promotes root rot and dampness is often the reason that it doesn’t perform well. It’s a tough plant though and once established only requires regular pruning after flowering has finished in the autumn.April not only sees the start of National Gardening Week , but it really kicks off the gardening season.Top April tips from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of .  The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we’re delighted this funding means they can continue. Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet. This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le. It’s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans’ community give each other, helping each other through dficult time. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we’d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.Brian Sloan, Age Scotland chief executive "},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It was not the practice to make public the particulars in cases where those responsible for criminal investigation were satisfied that no crime had been committed but he might mention, for the satisfaction of the honourable member and those on whose behalf the question was put, that on recovery of the body what was observed tended strongly to confirm the accuracy of the statements which had been made at the time by those who were with the deceased when the accident took place.#PICS:Alexander McNab, born Argyll in , at two stages in le. no_aMcNab_story_AlexClare#s great grandmother, Grace McNab Bridge, as a young woman in the early th century. no_aMcNab_story_GraceGrace in later years. no_aMcNab_story_GraceClare Frith has been researching her family history. no_aMcNab_story_ClarePrivate Andrew McNab, one of three McNab brothers killed during the First World War. no_aMcNab_story_Andrew"},{"url":null,"title":"shorter racing only scottish series planned","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Each route takes visitors on a real pilgrimage to ancient Christian landmarks, through remote and impressive landscapes.#Whilst Faith in Cowal is a Christian organisation, the routes are open to people of all faiths and none and provide the perfect way to connect with the wild beauty Cowal has to offer. Some of the sites that book-end each trail date as far back as the th and th centuries as well as more ancient landmarks such as Auchnaha Cairn that are thought to be Neolithic in origin.#The walks take in locations close to the major settlements and population centres of Cowal including Strachur, Dunoon, Kilfinan and Colintraive but they#re unlike any other path you#ll find. These are not all neatly manicured and waymarked trails. We have deliberately kept them dynamic and wild by making use of forestry roads and ancient heritage paths. Many of the routes require short, improvised hikes between paths so you#ll feel like a real pilgrim forging your way through the landscape.#There are detailed guides on our website as well as downloadable GPS tracks. We hope as many visitors to Cowal as possible will take this opportunity to step in the footsteps of ancient pilgrims and travellers, enjoy the wonderful scenery of Argyll and explore fascinating sites of genuine spiritual and religious importance,# added Dan.PICS:A map of the routes. no_aFootstepsFaithPhotos: subtlesensorHistoric Kilmun church, on the shores of the Holy Loch. no_aFootstepsFaith_©subtlesensor_Kilmorich graveyard, Cairndow. no_aFootstepsFaith_KilmorichGraveyard©subtlesensor"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 16 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

One of the highlights from last year’s event included celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by the lockdown for just over a year.

Other villagers have complained, among other things, about current noise levels from the quarry already being far too high and being heard inside homes # including a th century castle.According to some residents, retired villagers can no longer enjoy sitting outside their homes because of the sound of crushing machines.There was upset recently when the quarry upped its noise limit to  decibels without the nearby community getting a say.#That is the limit for quarries in rural areas but this is not a rural area, this is a village. The quarry is just  metres away,# said Simon Hunt, who runs  luxury accommodation at Kilmartin Castle with his partner Stef Burgeon. The couple have expressed fears the racket from the quarry could damage their business and threaten future growth plans.However, a report from council officers said noise mitigation measures had been invested in by the quarry  and that the most recent assessment demonstrated that it was having the desired effect with the works #practically inaudible# at the survey locations. Environmental Health was also content with those findings.Ms Burgeon and Mr Hunt say the only sound-proofing that has gone up so far at the quarry is scaffolding with insulation board cable tied to it.A council spokesperson told The Oban Times: #There are separate ongoing investigations by the council’s environmental health service under the Environmental Protection Act  which are still to be concluded. The determination of the planning application and Environmental Health investigation are not interdependent. In the event of noise levels being determined to be a statutory nuisance, the council can initiate formal action under this Act.#Yesterdayofficers were recommending members of the Planning, Protective Services and Licensing Committee approve MacLeod#s application subject to  conditions but were also recommending a discretionary hearing so any objectors and supporters can speak.Ms Burgeon said calls for a public meeting had previously been ignored.#This could be a win-win situation as long as the quarry puts in proper noise control like other quarries do around the world.#If they put up proper sound baffling that actually works then everyone would be happy. They could continue quarrying and the villagers could get on with enjoying their lives in peace.#Jane MacLeod from MacLeod Construction Limited said as part of the planning process sound tests had been carried out by a leading environmental consultancy firm approved by the council.Baffles and other noise reduction steps taken by the company have reduced noise levels signicantly, although previous noise levels were #very close to and often within permitted levels,# she said, adding the consultant#s report sent to the council indicated that noise levels are now #below background noise# such as passing vehicles and birdsong, and are well within permitted levels.There are no rock breakers in the quarry and #we do not crush rock in the quarry,# she said."},{"url":null,"title":"new door to door vaccine bus","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

what now WeaskedDr Georgia Perona-Wright, who is a senior lecturer in Immunology at the University of Glasgow, to weigh in.Can I still get Covid, after Irsquom vaccinated Yes, you can. The good news though is that itrsquos very much less likelythat you will get covidyoursquore vaccinated, compared to someone who isnrsquot.Even better, in the unlikely event that you do catch Covid after being vaccinated, you are much less likely to get severe symptoms or be hospitalised thanyou had not been vaccinated.The clinical trials for the Pfizer vaccine reported a % efficacy, which means that the number of people who showed symptoms of covid during the time of the trial was % lower in the vaccinated group than in a comparison group who were not vaccinated.Data collected since the trials, as the vaccines have begun to be used widely, has confirmed these numbers, so the vaccines are very effective on a population scale. On a inidual scale, though, there is still a chance that you might be one of the very few people who is vaccinated and still gets infected it is possible, just very much less likely than without a vaccine.One extra point to add here is that the vaccines take time to work.The vaccine is not a instant shot of protectionit is a way to train your immune system, so that your immune system will then protect you. It takes - weeks or so for the immune system to respond so, evenyou are someone who has a superb immune response to the vaccine, you are still not protected until - weeks after the jag.Some cases of people being infected with covid after the vaccination are because they were exposed to the virus during this - week window. Be especially cautious during this time.Can I still infect other people Just as the vaccines make it much less likely that yoursquoll get infected, they also make it much less likely that you will be able to infect others ndash but in both cases the answer is that the chances are much reduced, but not zero.We donrsquot fully understand why some people are fully protected and others are not it might be that you have a slightly quirky immune system, or are immunosuppressed it might be that you are exposed to an unusually high dose of the virus.It might be something in your genes or environment that makes you a particularly good target for the virus.When the first trials were conducted to test how well the vaccines work, the data that was collected measured the number of people who showed symptoms of disease. This number was reduced % in the Pfizer trial.The trials did not attempt to measure whether vaccinated people could still be infectious. We have some really encouraging data now, collected after the trials from countries where vaccines have been used widely, showing that vaccination does also reduce transmission ndash meaning that vaccinated people are less likely to infect othersthan people who are not vaccinated.This is what we expected and hoped for, and itrsquos really good to see. This is why being vaccinated not only protects ourselves, but also others.Viruses cannot live for long periods on their ownthey need a person to provide a home.If you are successfully vaccinated, then your body is trained to refuse entry to the virus, denying it that home.When only a few people are vaccinated, the virus can fairly easily find another person, another home to occupy. When very many people are vaccinated, finding a home becomes much more of a challenge, and the virus is condemned to a lonely death outside.The idea of working together by using our immune systems to reduce the number of opportunities that the virus has to gain a foothold and spread is whatrsquos called ldquoherd immunity.Even the rare people in whom the vaccine didnrsquot work very well can be protected this way, as other peoplersquos vaccinations mean that they too are less likely to encounter the virus.Can I stop wearing a facemask when Irsquom vaccinated No. The importance of a face mask is that it is a barrier to stop you infecting other people.We still need to be cautious to avoid infection, and to avoid infecting others, until the amount of virus circulating in our communities falls.The Covid vaccines are one part of our toolkit for reducing the amount of virus circulating. They make it less likely yoursquoll get infected, less likely yoursquoll get sick, and less likely yoursquoll breathe out the virus and spread it to others.But there is still a small chance that each of these steps can happen, and so facemasks, space and distance are all still needed just now.The gradual easing of restrictions that is beginning just now is possible because wersquove successfully driven case numbers down, in part through the vaccination programme.If we can keep this up, then we will get to a point when case numbers are low enough that restrictions will ease yet further, and facemasks might then become optionalin more places.Will immunity last We are optimisticthat immunity will last ndash but not yet certain.The first people to receive the Covid vaccines were only vaccinated  months ago, so we know that vaccines can generate immunity that lasts at least  months.We know that the majority of people who have been infected with the SARS-CoV virus, that causes Covid, also have persistent immune cells and good antibody levels, even a year after infection.There was a lot of fear that immunity would not last, and there are been some prominent cases where people have been shown to be infected twice ndash so in those particualr people, immunity was either not persistent or not ever good enough.But for the majority of people, infection has led to persistent immunity, so far.Another piece of encouraging news is that particular immune cells, essential for protection, were still detectable last year in people who were infected in  with SARS, which was a severe infection caused by a similar coronavirus to the one that causes Covid.So we are optimistic, but will only know for certain when more time has passed.Another twisthere, is whether immunity generated by having one of the current vaccines will be effective against any virus iants: lasting immunity might not be useful,the virus mutates and can escape that immunity. But there are grounds for optimism here toohellipWill I need a booster ... There are two situations in which a booster might be useful.The first one is immunity doesnrsquot last long enoughwithout a booster, and in that case a third jag is definitely a possible solution.The second one is the virus mutates or ies, and we need to update our vaccines to match the new iants. The coronavirus that causes Covid is one that is known to mutate ndash thatrsquos a normal part of its biology.The flu virus is another example of a virus that we know mutates, and thatrsquos why flu vaccines are updated and given every year.But the Covid vaccines have held up well so far: the vaccines currently being used in the UK were designed against the original version of the virus, but have done very well in reducing disease and blocking transmission of the B.. Kent iant, for example.The immune response generated by the vaccines is strong, and evenit is two fold less effective against a new iant, there is a good chance the remaining immune response will still be enough to prevent severe disease and slow the spread of the virus.Another piece of good news is the way that these new vaccines have been designed makes it a relatively simple process to update them,new iants make that necessary.If we do need boosters, that too should be achievable.Will everything go back to normal once everyone has had both doses The gradual easing of restrictionsthat have begun now reflects the success of our collective ability to reduce the amount of virus circulating, and getting people fully vaccinated is a large part of this success.I hope that this gradual process will continue as the vaccination programme is completed, and more normality will be achieved in each step.That said, we are still a long way away from everyone having both doses, as we need vaccinations to be completed globally before any inidual country can fully relax.Within the UK, the vaccination programme is currently planned for all adults, but vaccines for teenagers and younger children are only in the stage of clinical trials.Globally, some restrictions on international travelmight need to persist until global vaccination rates increase, and those gobal vaccination rates depend on politics and cooperation between nations.Another aspect to this question is what normal really means.The pandemic hit us hard and for people whorsquove been bereaved, who have persistent symptoms or Long Covid, or whose jobs and livelihoods have been affected, normal wonrsquot ever be as it was.And as communities, there are also changes both good and bad.Will hand sanitiser provision in supermarkets continue  Will working from home always be more possible  Will high streets rejuvenate  There are opportunities for change here,we want to grasp them but there may also need to be time to heal and recover."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-peeblesshire-tests-people-without-symptoms","story":"CORONAVIRUS tests for people without symptoms are being offered in Peeblesshire again from today.In a press release issued by NHS Borders last week, the health board outlined plans for rapid testing sites toacross the region.Tests will be offered in West Lintontodayand tomorrow.COVIDtesting will alsoin Peeblesand Innerleithenover the weekend.:Fire started deliberately in Peeblesshire, suspect police ndash appeal issuedTesting will take place at the fire stations of all the above locations between .am-pm.NHS Bordersrsquo director of public health, Dr Tim Patterson, said: ldquoCommunity testing of those who feel well and do not have any typical COVID- symptoms is one of the key ways that we can keep each other safe.

Some indication of Scott Parkrsquos status within the current and proposed Development Plans would also have aided transparency.ldquoNowhere do I see any attempt to reuse any of the existing buildings, which you might think might be a compelling reason in sustainability terms to examine this site rather more closely in the initial site search.ldquoAnd without a detailed brief being indicated, not only is it dficult to look at the fit and design options of the ious sites, but also it is unclear as to the centralisation of community facilities proposed here.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe council has made use of an online digital exercise supplemented with an unmanned exhibition in the Galashiels Transport Interchange to provide a robust consultation.ldquoWe would like to place on record our thanks to all of the people that have taken the time to submit comments on the proposals since the consultation went live on March .Anyone interested in making a comment can do so through the link on the councilrsquos website or directly to Galacampus@scotborders.gov.ukldquoFollowing the closure of this initial phase of the consultation, the feedback will be reflected upon and used to help prepare a report to the council in late spring recommending the next steps for the project.The full letter from Charles StrangI write on behalf of Scottish Borders Greens to draw your readersrsquo attention to the imminent closing date for submissions on the proposals for the ldquonew Gala Academy.Comments are due in on or before Monday  April. It has been suggested where, and in the columns of local newspapers, that this consultation is a sham.Why is it important that readers take the time and make the effort to respond to this consultation  It is not because the consultation itself has great merit.The Council itself has taken planning advice from consultants which tells them effectively that they need pay no attention to the results of any consultation.It may be that they have sought this independent advice because their own planners have maintained their professional judgements that the proposed site, given in perpetuity to the people of Galashiels as a ldquopleasure ground, is a key green space which should continue to be maintained as such.That is how they have described it in the recent consultative draft Local Development Plan, and no doubt in Development Plans before that.The Council appears reluctant to share their brief for this major improvement in secondary school provision for the Galashiels catchment area.It seems unlikely that, as has been suggested, there is no brief for this multi million pound expenditure: some form of brief would be essential to assess even one single option, never mind a range.Another useful role for any brief would be to examine the potential for retention of any of the educational facilities which already comprise the secondary school campus. This is a particularly important aspect when one considers the amount of embodied energy present in the existing buildings on the site. Plainly when one is addressing the sustainability of any development the existing buildings and site characteristics are critical factors.No, on the face of it this is not a genuine consultation, but a hollow exercise seeking to justy an Education Authority taking the easy option of expanding onto a greenfield site just because they think they can.The people who care about public open space, and trust in local government, should still be seeking to make their voices heard."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-borders-sees-no-cases-recorded-last-24-hours","story":"NO cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Borders over the last  hours.The Scottish Government released the latest data at pm today .There have now been , cases of COVID-in the region since the start of the pandemic ndash an increase of one over the weekend.Nationally, , positive cases have been recorded since March last year.According to the most recent data, there are still fewer than five people in hospital in the Borders with the virus.This has been the case every day through March and April, .You might also be interested in:Borders could get pound.m boost from major eventset for region, says councilBorders considers hiring empty homes officerto bring end to vacant propertiesMan assaulted partner and then gave abuse to nursesat Borders General Hospital"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-parliament-election-borders-candidates-hustings","story":"IN the lead-up to next monthrsquos Scottish Parliament elections, three hustings relevant to Borders voters will be held in the coming days.Tomorrowat .pm a virtual hustings over Zoom will be hosted by Borders environmental group Tweedgreen and Tweeddale Peace Group.This meeting will cover the constituency of Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale.All constituency candidates have been invited, with organisers saying questions will ldquofocus on the climate, peace and justice ndash all fundamental issues that are interlinked with the climate crisis, the COVID pandemic, and a green and just recovery from their effects.On Thursday eveningthe Liberal Democratsrsquo candidate for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale, Catriona Bhatia, will participate in a National Farmers Unionhustings at pm .A spokesperson for the NFU said: ldquoThis webinar will give members the opportunity to hear from and question the lead rural affairs candidates from each of the five main parties.And on April  there will be a West Linton event held over Zoom between .pm-pm.The third Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale hustings will welcome candidates from the five main parties represented at this yearrsquos election ndash more candidates could be added before the event.To join tomorrows Tweedgreen event and submit questions, email: tweedgreenpeebles@googlemail visit the NFU Scotland Facebook page to access the Zoom link for Thursdayrsquos hustings and to join the West Linton meeting, register at: tinyurl wlhustings and send questions to westlintonhustings@gmail"},{"url":null,"title":"broughton-john-buchan-way-trees-plan-opposed-campaigners","story":"PROPOSALS to plant trees in a National Scenic Areain the Borders have been met with opposition from locals.The plans for Peeblesshires John Buchan Way involve afforestation across  hectares, mainly for commercial purposes to produce timber, while native broadleaves will also be planted.The new woodland creation would be set ldquowithin the property at Broughton Hope and would see trees planted in one of the Borders two National Scenic Areas.With the consultation process having started, Broughton Community Council was contacted by RDS Forestry, leading to opposition from the community.Fiona Pagett, who has lived in Broughton for  years, has set up a Facebook group called lsquoSave our Glen - JBWrsquo which now has more than  members.:Outcry over bizarre plans to demolish historic mansion near the BordersldquoIrsquom incredibly heartened, though not remotely surprised, at the immediate and enormous opposition to the planting proposal at Broughton Hope, said Ms Pagett, an estate agent.ldquoWe are becoming engulfed in Sitka spruce plantations as the Scottish Government ploughs towards its spurious target of mass planting in the belief this will solve climate change.ldquoIt is disregarding our treasured and erse landscape and threatening much flora and fauna, added Ms Pagett, who lives in the village with her son Angus and daughter Katie.ldquoI have high hopes that this particular proposal, which affects the John Buchan Way, local residents, the shepherd and would negatively impact tourism, will gain the attention of those able to stop it in its tracks.According to Ms Pagett, -year-old shepherd Geordie Wilsonrsquos role ldquowill be removedthe proposals on the land go ahead.

In this instalment ndash the last of the series ndash we speak to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the SNP.Q. What is your party planning to do in the Borders A. Obviously for the Borders, as with the whole of the country, recovery from COVID is a top priority.To get the economy growing again, to support retail, to support tourism.Central to that, of course, will be infrastructure.The SNP has already delivered a signicant infrastructure project, which is very important to the Borders, in terms of the railway.Our manesto will set out plans to build on that and to go further. But to get the economy of the Borders up and running again, and to support growth and the overall wellbeing of people living in the Borders, will be a top priority.Q. Like many local authorities, Scottish Borders Council has declared a climate emergency. What is your party doing on that front A. I think the Scottish Government led the way in declaring a climate emergency.The Scottish Parliament in the last term of parliament has passed what, by any standards, are considered to be world-leading targets to become a net zero emissions country by . And to achieve by  a  per cent reduction in emissions.That puts us right at the leading edge of ambition in terms of ending our contribution to climate change. Setting the targets is the easy bit.Delivering that is, obviously, much more challenging. At the end of last year we published an updated climate change plan including about  dferent policies across how we heat our homes, how we travel around, agriculture, reducing emissions in industry, that will be necessary to meet those targets.Government has a leadership role to play, but to succeed we have to work in partnership with local authorities and, indeed, with the private sector.Obviously, hosting the COP  in Glasgow later this year will be a real catalyst, I think, for the Scottish Government and everybody in Scotland to showcase our ambition, but also to showcase what we are doing and encourage the rest of the world to join with us.Q. You have said that you would like an independent Scotland to join the EU. Would that mean a potentially damaging hard border between Scotland and the rest of the UK A. I donrsquot want a border. I have never wanted a border. I donrsquot want a hard border in future.In terms of the free movement of people, an independent Scotland would continue to be in the common travel area.So there would be no hard border in terms of people.Obviously, in terms of goods and services, our priority would be to keep trade flowing.It is Brexit that has created the issues of borders and many of our exports right now are facing real dficulty and losing a lot of business and a lot of money because of the border dficulties from the UK to the rest of Europe.Independence gives us the opportunity to become part of the European single market again ndash seven times the size of the UK market ndash but to continue to work with the UK and EU to keep trade flowing in both directions between Scotland and England.Q. What would you say your biggest goal was in an independent Scotland A. My biggest goal right now and in an independent Scotland is to make Scotland the best place in the world to grow up.Make it a great country for children to learn in, to grow up in, to make sure we can eradicate child poverty and for Scotland to be a confident, prosperous, fair and equal country.We know that is possible becausewe look across Europe right now at countries very similar in size to Scotland, but often without the vast natural resources that Scotland has, these are countries that are amongst the wealthiest, the fairest and the happiest countries in the world.If places like Norway and Denmark can do that, there is absolutely no reason why Scotland canrsquot as well.Q. Why do you think Scotland voted lsquonorsquo in  A. There is no doubt a iety of reasons.Scotland came closer to voting lsquoyesrsquo than many people would ever have predicted.For people like me, we have to continue to build support, trust and confidence and persuade people. In ,  per cent of people voted lsquoyesrsquo. Most opinion polls right now, including one just published in the last hour [the Border spoke to Ms Sturgeon on April ], show that independence is now supported by a majority of people in Scotland. So already we have moved on signicantly from .Once the COVID pandemic is over, I think people in Scotland should have the right to consider that again and make their choice.Readersrsquo questionsQ. Scotlandrsquos PISAresults in science and maths have dropped under SNP governments. Why has education got worse under the SNP A. We look at the data for exam results in Scotland, we see both attainment rising and the attainment gap closing.We have still got more work to do.That is why we are investing heavily in education and in education recovery, in more teachers.We have invested, over the last parliament, three quarters of a billion pounds specically closing the attainment gap.When we publish our manesto next week, we will set out our plans for the next parliament. Scottish education is high quality.There is work to do to make sure it continues to improve and that we close the poverty-related attainment gap. Part, of course, closing the poverty-related attainment gap is not just focusing on attainment in schools, but focusing on poverty.And we have already taken more action than any previous government in Scotland ndash establishing the Scottish Child Payment, for example, and wersquove put forward plans in this election to double that in the next parliament.A key part in raising educational attainment is to lt children out of poverty.Q. Would there be an Indyref ,you were to lose a second independence referendum A. I donrsquot intend for that to be the situation, so it is a completely hypothetical question."},{"url":null,"title":"queen-issues-statement-time-great-sadness-birthday","story":"The Queen has sent a message to people across the world to mark her th birthday.In a statement released by the Royal Family on behalf of the Queen, Her Majesty thanked people across the UK, the Commonwealth and around the world for their kindness and support during a time of ldquogreat sadness.The statement read: ldquoI have, on the occasion of my th birthday today, received many messages of good wishes, which I very much appreciate.ldquoWhile as a family we are in a period of great sadness, it has been a comfort to us all to see and hear the tributes paid to my husband, from those withing the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and around the world.ldquoMy family and I would like to thank you for all the support and kindness shown to us in recent days.ldquoWe have been deeply touched, and continue to be reminded that Philip had such an extraordinary impact on countless people throughout his le.The Queenrsquos message to people across the world who have sent tributes and messages of condolence following the death of The Duke of Edinburgh. pic apWszXSmdash The Royal FamilyApril , Members of the monarchy have been supporting the Queen throughout the mourning period for Philip, and some of her family are expected to be with her at Windsor Castle.It is the first birthday she has celebrated without her husband for more than  years.Boris Johnson said he is ldquoproud to serve as the Queenrsquos Prime Minister as the monarch marks her th birthday privately following the death of her ldquobeloved husband the Duke of Edinburgh.The Prime Minister wrote on Twitter: ldquoI would like to send my warm wishes to Her Majesty The Queen on her th birthday.ldquoI have always had the highest admiration for Her Majesty and her service to this country and the Commonwealth.ldquoI am proud to serve as her Prime Minister.Philiprsquos family and friends gathered at St Georgersquos Chapel in Windsor on Saturday to say their final farewell to the duke, who died peacefully on April .His death came a few months before his th birthday, which was due to be the focus of royal celebrations this year, while the Queenrsquos th was to be more low-key.After  years of married le the Queen now reigns alone without the support of her ldquostrength and stay, as she famously described her late husband."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-borders-cases-update-included-official-data","story":"NO cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Borders over the last  hours.The Scottish Government released the latest data at pm today .A total of , cases of COVID-have been recorded in the region since the start of the pandemic.Nationally, , people have tested positive since March last year.According to the most recent data, there are still fewer than five people in hospital in the Borders with the virus.This has been the case every day through March and April, .You might also be interested in:Fresh attack on Galashiels Academy planssees consultation dubbed disingenuousUnderage drinkers in Borders town have no fear of the police, meeting hearsOutraged Borders residents slam plans for new treeson treasured land"},{"url":null,"title":"enduro-world-series-scottish-borders-council-give-funds","story":"ORGANISERS of a major event ing to the Borders this year will receive up to pound, of council support.During a meeting yesterday , Scottish Borders Councils executive committee agreed to help mountain bikings Enduro World Series .Rob Dickson, the councilrsquos executive director, said the money was ldquoconsistent with funding given to other events.:Borders could get pound.m boost from major event set for region, says councilldquoThe consequences of COVID-have been far-reaching and responding to that has been challenging, Mr Dickson told members.ldquoWe think itrsquos right and proper to provide dedicated funding for planning an event.Tweeddale East councillor Robin Tatler, an independent member, said: ldquoThe Enduro World Series would be a fantastic start to building back our events programme.ldquoItrsquos important that we get behind that this year and the coming years.:Outraged Borders residents slam plans for new trees on treasured landThe EWS is scheduled to come to the Tweed Valley in the autumn.It was previously hosted in the region in .Organisers are said to be keen for the event tofor a further four years after the forthcoming edition."},{"url":null,"title":"junior rugby club pays tribute to dedicated coach","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It underlines the fact that it is communities who know best what is best for them.Argyll and Bute Council was at the centre of ensuring our resilience teams got support and Scottish Government funding dispersed quickly and efficiently.That is why I find the decision of the Tory Lib Dem Independent ruling administration to remove the recycling service from Kintyre Recycling Ltdand taking it in-house as short-sighted. And giving them only six months notice is disgraceful.KRL has provided a reliable service for the community since  and given employment opportunities to people with barriers to work. It has a committed board and management team who have ersied the projects it does to ensure sustainability. But this decision leaves a gaping hole in its business plan and a workforce unsurethey will still have jobs.There is a projected increase in cost of £, to supply recycling bins across Kintyre. But this does not take account of the possible social and welfare cost of the impact on the workforce. This is yet another blow to the community already hammered by unemployment.I urge the council to work closely with KRL to find a solution that ensures that all of the KRL employees at risk of redundancy are found suitable employment and that this valuable organisation can continue to employ vulnerable people providing services from which everyone benefits.In , the SNP published a coloured map showing options for the route of the A at the Rest and Be Thankful. Nine years later, all they have done is colour in the map slightly dferently. We are no further forward.Whoever is in government after the election must stump up the money needed to construct a road protected from landslides. This must be done a lot quicker than the  years the SNP say it will take them.Without urgent action, many businesses in Argyll will not survive.Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signs.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside of Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples.In my opinion, in the future, Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs. Road signs help regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important preview especially during night-time conditions.I will continue to campaign for more frequent road sign maintenance for every corner of my ward.Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason, Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year.Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.I work for a television company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who want to live a simpler le. The filming will take place over a number of months this year in rural Britain.The idea behind the series is about saying goodbye to smartphones, Zoom calls, social media # all the distractions and pressures of normal le # to go and live a simpler le, experience the #good le# fantasy and think about what our modern le and its multitude of choices has really given us. We will explore the idea of whether, in fact, less is more.We are looking for people of all ages to apply families, couples, single people # to take time out from their normal le and step into a dferent way of living.If any of your readers are interested in finding out more, they should email simplele@fivemilefilms, telling us briefly why you would like to live a simpler le.Since the UK was first officially plunged into lockdown, we have lived through what is probably the most extraordinary year in most people#s letimes.Blind and partially sighted people have had to adjust like everyone  to the daily challenges this has created. Thankfully, there#s now light at the end of the tunnel. But some ongoing measures could continue to be barriers to their independence and confidence.People with sight-loss can sometimes find it dficult to judge space, so we#re asking everyone to maintain their own distance, be patient and be helpful.Just getting out and about can be more hazardous for those without sight. The government#s #Spaces for People# initiative has already transformed many of our streets and thoroughfares.We must take care that this doesn#t inadvertently create new obstacles for those with disabilities.The Covid crisis has given all of us a sense of uncertainty and vulnerability, of what it#s like to depend more on others. So let#s make one positive legacy of this crisis a resolve to make sure we re-emerge as a society in which no one is left at the margins.Following publication of his poem #On Distant Shore# in last week#s Courier, Jim McRobert, originally from Campbeltown but now living in Musselburgh, has sent in another one of his self-penned verses.

It is not depression it is more subtle and has spiritual overtones – I would say it is most profoundly a spiritual phenomenon.Looking into it, I clearly identied aspects of it in myself today! It appears to be the most #underdiagnosed# and unacknowledged spiritual illness of this age.I found that Pope Francis also came across it. Commenting in the context of healing the paralytic by the pool, he said the #first illness# is the one afflicting the paralysed man. He had #resigned himself to it,# the Pope said, #perhaps saying to himself: #Le is unfair, others are more fortunate than I am#. There is a plaintive tone in this way of speaking # there is resignation but there is also bitterness.#He added that it is an attitude reminiscent of #many [Christians] who lack enthusiasm and who are bitter#, who repeatedly say to themselves: #I go to [church] every Sunday but it is better not to become involved! I believe for my own sake, but I don#t feel the need to give it to others: each one peacefully at his own home.#These people, the Pope added, also take the attitude that # you do something well in le, they#ll reprove you: so, it#s better not to take the risk#.Good Friday, Easter Sunday # excellent days to take the risk and resolve to do something well in le, to set sensible goals to be better than I am now.

In summary, the society was to promote the study of the archaeology of Kintyre and adjacent islands, to investigate the history and antiquities of the area and to preserve and publish relevant records and documents.The office-bearers were: President, Macdonald of Largie Vice-presidents, Sherf Macmaster Campbell, Colonel Mactaggart and Thomas Lindsay Galloway Hon secretary and treasurer, Duncan Colville Council, Mrs T L Galloway , Latimer MacInnes, Dean of Guild Neil McArthur, Major W Macalister Hall of Torrisdale, Mrs Macneal of Lossit , Archibald Dunlop Armour and Rev Norman Mackenzie.Of these, Macmaster Campbell, Mactaggart, MacInnes and Colville would power the research engine of the society in the early decades of its existence with studies on archaeology, history, place-names and local dialect.The scholarly talents of two of the founder-members, Macdonald of Largie and Lindsay Galloway, were almost immediately annulled by the time of the society#s first annual general meeting on November  , both were dead.Macdonald, a product of Eton and Oxford, was the author of a three-volume History of France, and Galloway, a distinguished mining engineer and protégé of Lord Kelvin, in  graduated MA at Glasgow University with first class honours in mathematics and natural philosophy, #a very rare distinction#."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Sadly we have all heard of someone who has been affected by stroke and many people like me have tragically lost someone too.Almost five years ago, my wonderful mum, Diana, suffered a severe stroke. She died four weeks later. My mum was the most active, #full of le# person I knew. She LOVED le. She was my best friend and I miss her every day. That#s why I want to ask your readers to take part in the Stroke Association#s A Walk to Remember.This wonderful event is a special way to celebrate the le of your loved one whilst raising money in their memory.Simply pick a special place that is filled with memories, create your route, and on June  take part in your own walk to remember to raise funds for the Stroke Association.Stroke strikes every five minutes in the UK, and there are around , survivors in Scotland living with its devastating effects who really need our help.Like so many charities, the pandemic has drastically affected the Stroke Association#s income.However the charity has still been supporting stroke survivors as much as they can with support and advice, while continuing to fund vital research into the condition.Please join me and do something amazing in your loved one#s memory by taking part in A Walk to Remember.It#s bound to be an emotional but amazing day for all of us that have lost someone to stroke. Walk in their memory and raise funds to rebuild more lives after stroke.To sign up, please visit https:www.stroke.org.uk fundraising a-walk-to-rememberChildren#s lives have been turned upside over the last year due to challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, with many spending extended periods of time out of school and behind closed doors.The NSPCC#s Childline service has heard from thousands of children who have found this time really challenging.Some have felt overwhelmed with home schooling and struggled to access their learning due to a lack of technology, whilst others have missed their friends and family and many have seen their mental health deteriorate.The NSPCC and Childline adapted during the pandemic so our frontline staff could continue to be here as a vital source of support for those children who felt like they had nowhere  to turn.Even though many children in Scotland are now back at school, it remains vital that we are still here to support those who are struggling with the impact that the pandemic has had on them.To help us be here for children and to remind them that Childline is a source of support they can turn to, we are encouraging schools across the country to get involved in the NSPCC#s Number Day.This annual fundraising day, which is based around fun maths activities, will take place in primary and secondary schools across the country on May  in aid of the children#s charity.As part of the day, schools can sign up to enjoy puzzles, games and challenges to raise vital funds.There are a range of activities for dferent age groups and teachers will also be provided with resources including information on supporting their school#s safeguarding.It#s now more essential than ever that children aren#t left alone, isolated and unsupported with their worries, and the money raised from Number Day will help the NSPCC in its mission to make  a better year for children.To sign up, visit the NSPCC#s website and search for Number Day and fill in your school#s details using the registration form.Age Scotland has won a £, grant for an innovative telephone friendship service which links older members of the ex-services community.Our Comradeship Circles service has helped to connect hundreds of older veterans for regular group calls since the pilot scheme was launched six months ago.The funding from the Armed Forces Covenant Fund Trust#s Tackling Loneliness Programme will enable our service to expand and continue until autumn , reaching even more older people. We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of . The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we#re delighted this funding means they can continue.Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet.This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le.It#s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans# community gives each other, helping each other through dficult times. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we#d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.I have been contacted by many of my constituents about the concerning condition of Ballymartin road on Islay.It has gradually been getting worse over the years but is now as bad as it has ever been and is getting to the stage that it#s nearly not passable for a small car without risking damage.I have raised this with our roads department and although funds are stretched, this road is clearly in need of some desperate repairs and,left unmaintained for any longer, will only end up costing the hard-pressed council taxpayer more to fix in the long-run."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The disciples were huddled indoors in fear of their lives when suddenly the resurrected Jesus was there among them.Thomas hadn#t been with the others when it happened. He just could not bring himself to believe without seeing him for himself. Thomas gets a bad press because of this.We often react to this wee excerpt from Thomas#s story aswe would have been less reluctant to believe. We carry our willingness to believe as a badge of faith. Poor old Doubting Thomas.But is doubt a weakness  Or is it simply an opportunity, a space, a fertile ground in which faith might grow and ultimately blossom A week later, the disciples were gathered again in the same house where they had last seen Jesus. This time, Thomas was with them. Once again, Jesus came and stood among them. He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side. Do not doubt but believe.#Jesus#s words are aimed not only at Thomas, but at everyone who encounters this story, and struggles to believe that God is capable of doing the very thing that God has promised — call our world into new and unending, resurrected le.#Do not doubt but believe.#"},{"url":null,"title":"two pairs triumph at dunaverty","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

All money raised will be kept in the area.She said: #Unfortunately, the diagnosis for Dad was too late, but I know how crucial the service Macmillan provides within the rural community is for all families.#Therefore, my aim is to raise awareness and as much money as possible for Macmillan Cancer Support with all money staying in Argyll and Bute. This money is invaluable in supporting families living with cancer locally.#Lindsay is inviting as many people as possible to join her — in a socially distanced manner — for the full walk or as many or few sections as they like.It will be an early rise for those wanting to do the first leg, as the walk is set to begin at .am.The approximate leaving times from Westport for the remaining sections are: .am, .am, .pm and .pm. Further details will be shared nearer the time.There is no need to sign up. Those wishing to join Lindsay on her walk should just show up at one or all of the starting times. Light refreshments will be provided throughout the day.Lindsay#s sister-in-law Leighann Burns, who has been helping promote the challenge, said: #This is a great opportunity for people of all ages to get together to raise money for an invaluable community service.#It would be lovely to see as many people locally take part on the day, socially distanced of course.#Donations can be made on the day or via Lindsay#s JustGiving page. Search #Lindsay Ramsay Walk at Westport# on www.justgivingLindsay is well on her way towards her fundraising target, having already received donations amounting to more than £ by the time the Courier went to press.A Macmillan Cancer support spokesperson said: #At Macmillan, we give people with cancer everything we#ve got. If you are diagnosed, your worries are our worries. We do whatever it takes. But without your help, we can#t support everyone who needs us.#The charity#s Kintyre fundraising group usually holds annual events to raise essential funds but this has not been possible during the Covid- pandemic, so Lindsay#s challenge will provide a welcome boost."},{"url":null,"title":"tennis players return to the sport they love","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Meantime, however, with the exception of the magazine, all society activities remain in a state of suspension."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And now, more than a week later and despite updates in the interim about the reopening of schools, they#re still waiting – and it#s not acceptable.Like everyone , islanders are desperate to know when they can reconnect with family and friends. Island businesses are equally frantic to know when and how they can make plans for the weeks ahead.But, unlike everyone , our islands are at a complete disadvantage. They still don#t know what is happening, or when. They deserve better. The Scottish Government needs to respond to our islands# call for clarity and let them, like the rest of the country, start to think and plan ahead.Now in its nd year, the Big Garden Birdwatch is a chance for people of all ages to count the number of birds that visit their garden helping the Royal Society for the Protection of Birdsto build up a picture of how they are doing.This year, more than a million people across the UK, including more than , in Scotland, took part, counting  million birds.The event, held over the last weekend in January, revealed the house sparrow held on to its number one spot. But  out of the top  bird species showed declines in average numbers in Scotland compared to last year.Starlings remained in second place, but numbers were down  per cent compared to . Goldfinches saw the greatest decline in Scotland’s top , falling four places from sixth position last year, with reported numbers  per cent fewer than .I am absolutely delighted with the number of people who have taken part, making it the biggest year ever for RSPB Scotland.This has generated a massive amount of data which will help our scientists with important conservation work, but it also shows how many of us have turned to nature after what has been a dficult  months.We need every voice raised to stand up for nature. The wildle that brings us so much interest and solace is now just a fraction of what should be there.Big Garden Birdwatch has shown that people across Scotland have a real passion for their wildle. We now need government to take the global leadership, policy and legislative opportunities open to it this year to reverse the decline and restore nature.It#s no exaggeration to say that when a dog goes missing or is stolen, it is heart-breaking.Dogs for Good has put together some tips to reduce the likelihood of your dog being taken.If the unthinkable happens and your dog is taken, remember, you are not alone. There are plenty online groups and pages offering guidance and support. DogLost is an excellent charity which provides a free lost and found service.You should also noty police, dog wardens, vets and local rescue centres.Tables for Dementia UK#s annual cake and tea event, Time for a Cuppa, have been reset.Dementia UK is the only charity dedicated to supporting the whole family through dementia specialist Admiral Nurses.The charity#s annual fundraising event takes place between May  and May .Since its launch, it has raised more than £ million with the support of fundraisers, Dementia UK staff and celebrities.One of the highlights of last year#s event was celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by lockdown for just over a year now. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness have disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever. We are so grateful to all our fundraisers who will be whipping up treats, enthusiasm, funds and who are giving their time for others – in a socially distanced way of course – in what will be a special and important Time for a Cuppa.For more information about Time for a Cuppa and how to host your own tea party with our free fundraising pack, visit the dementiauk.org timeforacuppa webpage."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In our desire to understand it, we have created starry patterns in our minds like the Plough, the Bull and so on, however, the signs of the Zodiac were already known to the Babylonians in  BC so that is not something new.Today, constellations like Aries, Gemini and others continue to fascinate followers of both astronomy and astrology.One of the most interesting star formations is the Pleiades, better known as the Seven Sisters. Positioned a little to the right of Taurus, they are an unmistakable sight in the winter sky.Even a modest pair of binoculars will reveal that there are many more stars in that cluster than the naked eye can discern. The Pleiades along with Orion, are even mentioned in the bible, in the Book of Job, chapter ..With the aid of binoculars these stars are a truly dazzling sight.The bible is a collection of books coming from the pens of many dferent authors over a long period of time.

Any forward player will tell you that. If you have a terrible game and score a goal or play fantastic and not score ndash you are judged on your goals as a forward.ldquoHopefully, I will get another goal but I need to make sure I am in the team.

ndash sometimes at great personal cost.I believe that offering our NHS staff an inflation-busting four per cent pay rise is well deserved, although I wish it could be more.South of the Border, one per cent is being imposed.This is simply an insult.There is a perception that our NHS is lsquobrokenrsquo in some way.I do not believe this, but I do see a huge organisation which now needs to re-invent itself, not for the first time, into an efficient, modern support for us all.However, our NHS is genuinely under threat.Privatisation is not just a scare word.The Transatlantic Trade Deal being negotiated with the USA leaves our NHS vulnerable and available for sale.Our SNP MPs proposed an amendment which would have ensured that our NHS remained in the public ownership.The Westminster Government rejected that safeguard.Since GP surgeries are independent contractors, not run by the NHS, they are vulnerable to being sold to the highest bidder.This is how the system was set up in .It may have made sense at the time but no longer.We must review the deal with doctors and ensure that creeping privatisation cannot take place.In Scotland, we have control over our NHS.However, the UK Government passed the Internal Markets Act, which allows UK Government ministers to arbitrarily enforce a lsquolevelling outrsquo of regulations and dferences between the nations of the UK.This would allow London to make NHS Scotland available for sale regardless of our wishes.I will fight to prevent the loss of our NHS and the best way to be sure of that is to take back control of our own

Edinburgh ndash a dedicated public servant.I send my condolences to Her Majesty The Queen and her family.The quality of our social care system should be a key issue at this election.The speed with which the failings of our social care system were exposed last spring was ghastly.The Covid crisis didnrsquot bring about the crisis in social care, it was already there.It simply brought it to the top of the agenda.The challenge of Covid- has made the crisis in care even more acute.The movement of people from hospital settings, without consultation and without being tested, into care homes to accommodate Covid patients was a human rights scandal.This contributed to the devastating reality of care homes becoming the epicentre of the pandemic and almost a third of deaths across the country being people from care homes.Scotlandrsquos social care workers have also been on the frontline in the fight against Covid.Their commitment, alongside all our other frontline workers, to help keep us safe during this public health emergency has been heroic.Scottish Labour has been calling for a National Care Service for some years now, a service that will include local governmentrsquos social care staff as partners in the service delivery.It will put the dignity of iniduals and the quality of services before profit.We must address the inequalities in the sector as it deals with the shortcomings highlighted in the recent Feeley Report, which I donrsquot think goes far enough.Scotland urgently needs a plan to transform social care. Scottish Labour knows that urgent reform and investment is needed and thatrsquos why we are working with the public to make our vision for a National Care Service a reality.We donrsquot want to just talk about the problems, we want a plan for how things could be better.Charles Dundas A QUESTION which I keep being asked during this campaign is what will the Scottish Liberal Democrats do for those in our communities who are struggling to make ends meet, especially those with children I know that all parties are committed to reducing child poverty, but here is what I want to do about it.Willie Rennie and the Scottish Liberal Democrats will commit to doubling the Scottish Child Payment.This is currently available at pound per week to eligible children under six.This will rise to take in under-s in the next few years and we will pay pound per week.We are also keen to listen to campaigners who want to extend the payments to include disabled children or those with disabled parents.It was Liberal Democrats who reintroduced free school meals and targeted extra money to schools who needed it most in England, and in Scotland we will extend free school meals to cover all primary school pupils all through the year, including school holidays.This will also help these children with their education since a hungry child finds it dficult to focus and learn.The Scottish Lib Dems also pledge to increase the amount of free childcare Scotland offers, increasing it to a full , hours for every two-year-old.At the moment only some twoyear-olds are eligible, and takeup of the places is very low.By expanding the scheme, wersquod hope it would be more useful to more and more working parents, helping them get back to work and all the benefits that brings to society and the economy.We will also extend the number of summer clubs on offer to eligible children to help parents on low incomes with the costs of childcare during the school holidays.Plus, our manesto pledge on fuel poverty will also help us with child poverty.Warm homes with lower heating costs undoubtedly help the families who need it most, and I think that Midlothian North and Musselburgh would benefit from more Liberal Democrat policies like these in place after the election.Iain Whyte AS PART of my campaign, I have been highlighting the need for more local policing and ato locally based crime prevention across the constituency.This should be backed by visible local police patrols in our neighbourhoods to deter and detect crime.So, it was disappointing to read news articles this week highlighting police advice to Musselburgh householders about securing their garden sheds due to a spate of breakins.The crimes seem to have been concentrated in the Stoneybank area but the advice is valuable for everyone.Police say you should make sure your shed is secure and should fit an alarmthere is anything valuable inside.The alarms can be provided free to elderly and vulnerable residents: email MusselburghWestCPT@scotland.pnn.police.ukSince Police Scotland was formed, there has been a centralisation of our policing that I want to see reversed.During that time, public awareness of police patrols fell from  to  per cent.I know from my time as chair of Lothian and Borders Police Board that locally based crime prevention had a really positive impact.Crime fell and communities felt far more connected to their local officers, who they knew were working on their priorities.Thatrsquos why I want to see beefed-up neighbourhood policing teams and theirin the parts of the constituency where they have been reduced or removed.These teams work well on a preventative agenda.They solve problem issues and work with the community sorting things like housebreaking sprees and anti-social behaviour.I also strongly support the wider Scottish Conservative campaign to introduce a Local Policing Act to boost local police patrols and increase community engagement with policing decisions.This goes alongside our plan to tackle more serious crime by introducing a Victims Law to end the SNPrsquos soft-touch justice system.This would give judges the ability to put the very worst criminals behind bars for le.It would also end automatic early release, so that criminals must earn parole.Musselburgh residents need to see a more visible, local and responsive police service.That would be my aimyou elect me as your MSP."},{"url":null,"title":"groundwork-begins-new-46m-high-school-wallyford","story":"The new Wallyford Secondary Learning Campus will be built on farmland west of Masons Way and is expected to take about two years to build.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said that the preparatory groundworks would include the erection of fencing around the perimeter, and excavation and removal of topsoil.

If yoursquove never tried growing tomatoes, this could be the year to have a go!Getting startedSome gardeners begin with seed but ensuring the correct temperatures for germinating tomato seeds can be tricky. We find that most people prefer to buy their tomatoes as young plants, and these are available in pots at this time of year. Buying tomatoes as young plants also gives gardeners the opportunity to mix and match dferent ieties.Therersquos a vast range of ieties to choose from, which at first may seem quite disconcerting. So start by considering the type of tomato you prefer and the space you have available to grow them.Generally speaking, tomatoes are either grown on a single, upright stemor as a bush.If itrsquos your first time growing tomatoes, it might be easier to begin with one of the bush ieties, but read on and decide for yourself!Bush tomatoesTwo of our most popular bush-type ieties are lsquoTumblerrsquo and lsquoTumbling Tom Redrsquo but seedsmen are always improving ieties so take time to read the labels on the plants in the garden centre before making your choice.Bush tomatoes tend to have a slightly weeping habit, making them well-suited to being grown in pots, window boxes or hanging baskets. They tend to be relatively compact plants with numerous sideshoots producing clusters of tomatoes.Upright tomatoesAmongst the upright ieties lsquoAlicantersquo, lsquoMoneymakerrsquo and lsquoShirleyrsquo are well tried-and-tested, producing a good crop of full size, red tomatoes.For cherry tomatoes, lsquoGardenerrsquos Delightrsquo is by far the most popular choice amongst our customers.Upright tomatoes can be grown in pots, grow-bags or directly into the ground. As the plant grows, the stem needs to be kept straight so that it can bear the weight of the tomatoes and will require support either by canes or string.To maintain the strength of the main stem, sideshoots need to be nipped out. Sideshoots are the little shoots that appear in the angle between the leaf and the main stem and, as any tomato grower will tell you, itrsquos a job that requires to be done very regularly!Other ietiesTherersquos also a wide selection of yellow, beef-steak, plum and other distinctive ieties to choose from, so take your time to read the labels and choose the ieties that will best suit you, your garden and your family.CultivationAll tomatoes like a warm, sunny location to grow. Outdoor-grown tomatoeswill have to be well-sheltered, although there still needs to be some movement of air to avoid disease.Watering needs to be consistent and regular, and tomatoes growing in pots or growbags will benefit from having a tray underneath to provide a reservoir that they can draw from between waterings.

the site where legend tells he was killed by a giant.Then, at Finnrsquos request, they walked to nearby Finlarig Castle.Izzy had always felt the castle had a sombre atmosphere, and so it did, even on this sun-drenched afternoon.Maybe itrsquos because it is quietly hidden away from the tourist trail, its unstable ruins concealed by old trees.Normally a tranquil place feels magical, but the grim deeds said to have been committed here darken the feelings.Izzy had already told Finn of the castle and he wanted to see the beheading pit and hanging tree.It was another built by the Campbell chief lsquoBlack Duncan of the castlesrsquo at the beginning of the s ndash such a ruthless man, andaccounts of him were true, very cruel even for his time.At Finlarig, it is said, he enacted his lsquojusticersquo, in particular against the MacGregors, whose land he had taken and whom he hunted mercilessly.Finn stood in the pit where, according to tradition, noble victims were executed.Their Campbell persecutors could watch and gloat from a window above in the tower.Nearby was the hanging tree, where people of lesser status were said to have met their end.Finn found the overgrown steps that led to the summit of the small hill on which the tree grew.They stood on the spot where so many condemned men would have had their last view of this world.ldquoYoursquore right, aunty, this place does have a bit of a gothic atmosphere, especially when you know that so many people were hanged on the branches of this tree.Izzy nodded: ldquoBut remember, Finn, eventhis is the original hanging tree, then it is innocent, she said as they stood under its boughs.ldquoThe poor thing was used to commit terrible crimes, she put her hand on its trunk, ldquobut it wasnrsquot the treersquos fault.Finn wasnrsquot sureshe was joking itrsquos just a tree, how could it be blamed He put it down to his auntrsquos love of nature.She often spoke asplants and animals were like people.Finn looked around.ldquoCan you tell me a story about this place  he asked.Izzy thought for a moment, then agreed.They sat on a stone by an old holly tree in the sunshine and Izzy told two stories.First, the tale of a wedding at the castle interrupted by MacDonalds lting cattle.Then she told the tale of Marion Campbell, a daughter of a powerful Campbell chief.She had been promised to a man she didnrsquot love, but instead she eloped with Gregor Roy MacGregor, the chief of the MacGregors.ldquoThe sad thing is, explained Izzy, ldquothat beforehand the MacGregors and Campbells had been close allies for many generations, but then a feud over land and power developed.So Gregor Roy was forced into the hills as an outlaw, and Marion willingly joined him, marrying him against her fatherrsquos wishes.ldquoDespite their tough le, said Izzy, ldquothey deeply loved each other.Finn was fascinated as Izzy told Finn stories of their adventures of how they lived in the wilds, living in secret hideouts, hunted by the warriors of Marionrsquos father.She told the tale of how Gregor once escaped his pursuers by leaping over a river and how Marion gave birth to their first son in a cave.ldquoThey wrought vengeance on the Campbells, lting their cattle, said Izzy, ldquobut eventually they were found and Gregor was beheaded by a Campbell chief called Grey Colin in .ldquoIn the beheading pit  asked Finn.ldquoNo, not here, said Izzy, ldquobut at another castle at the east end of Loch Tay.\"Some accounts say poor Marion was forced to watch, and afterwards she composed a beautul lament, which is a sad song.\"She wrote it for her son, to explain to him what had happened to his father.Izzy recited a verse she could remember: ldquoEven in snow and blizzards, And days with all the seasons, Gregor would find a hollow for me, In which we would sleep cosily.ldquoWow, what a story. What happened to her after  asked Finn.Izzy shook her head: ldquoNobody knows, she disappears from history, but her son Alistair later avenged his fatherrsquos death and so the feuding continued, which explains the grim deeds at this castle.ldquoMaybe her son protected her after and hid her to keep her safe, wondered Finn.ldquoThatrsquos a nice thought, maybe.Finn stood up and walked around.ldquoIt would be betterfolks could just get on, donrsquot you think! he announced.ldquoAgreed! said Izzy.They walked back to the village.They had a much-needed wash with hot water and Finn called his mum.After a while, he poked his head out of the phone box: ldquoMum wants to talk to you.Izzy knew how dficult this time was for her sister, being separated from her son overnight for the first time in four years.But Izzy was trusted by her and Finnrsquos attachment to his aunt was very strong and made him feel safe.He was obviously missing his mother, but he seemed to be enjoying the journey and his moods had been better, so it was decided the journey could continue.ldquoRemember, mumrsquos back from Spain on Monday eve.ldquoI know, smiled Izzy, ldquowe will be there to meet her, I promise.After the call, they did some shopping and made a quick visit to the Folk Museum, which was housed in the old mill by the side of the river.Izzy wanted to show Finn St Fillanrsquos Stones, which were on display there ndash a tale to tell later when they went for a swim in his pool.As they walked back onto the bridge, Izzy had a surprise.She unlocked the gate which led to the old MacNab burial ground, where chiefs of the clan lie in a walled enclosure, their clan folk in the surrounding ground.ldquoItrsquos actually an island in the middle of the river, explained Izzy.ldquoIts name means yellow island. It was a prehistoric fort before it was a burial ground.Finn nodded as he walked round the edge, looking through the trees down at the river as it roared, then calmed its way to Loch Tay.Izzy spotted a carving of the MacNab crest, with an image of the head of a MacNeish chief, a reminder of a famous incident in the clanrsquos history.ldquoIrsquom getting hungry, aunty, said Finn.She had a plan for tea.They would eat within the ruins of Rob Royrsquos house at Auchinchisallen in Glen Dochart.It was a -minute drive west of Killin.They parked at a small layby just past the small bridge that took the busy traffic over the burn called Allt Coire Chaorach.ldquoThat there  asked Finn, pointing at the ruins.ldquoLooks like mostly a pile of stones with a chimney.ldquoItrsquos called Rob Royrsquos house, letrsquos have our tea there, said Izzy.ldquoReally, it was his house  How do we get to it It was a good question.Once they got over the gate, they followed a narrow bracken-covered path.They got scratched as they scrambled up a steep slope, but suddenly they were on the top and the ruined house was in front of them.They were only a short distance from the road, but it felt like a dferent world.Finn stood on a large stone that once formed part of the foundations and looked up at the one gable end that was still standing.No, it wasnrsquot just a pile of stones, he thought, he could see it had been a house.Finn scanned the landscape around him.Occasional traffic could be heard not far below, but the road seemed engulfed and made insignicant by the mountains and hills that dominated the view.A herd of highland cattle were grazing nearby.ldquoLook, look! We have our own Highland cows! Finn called to his aunt.ldquoPerfect, she said as she her puffed her way to the house.Finn jumped from the stone down to his aunt.ldquoSorry, let me help, he said.ldquoLetrsquos get set up said Izzy, laying the heavy rucksack down.Finn went for a closer look at the cattle while Izzy found a safe place to sit within the ruins.She got out the camping stove and began to cook.Finn joined her and they stared at the pasta as it twirled in the boiling water.The cows came to watch, standing in a row, tails twitching with a fascinated look on their faces.ldquoYoursquore right in what you said, aunty, remarked Finn between mouthfuls of pasta.Izzy curled her eyebrows not sure what he was referring to.ldquoFood tastes much better when itrsquos cooked outside, in a place like this, he explained with a big sauce-covered grin.The sun was now lowering in the sky and Izzy could feel the air finally cooling.The huge presence of Ben More was casting shadows in the glen.She took out her small fire dish, screwed on its legs and placed it carefully within the ruins, away from any vegetation.Finn suggested moving some stones to make more comfortable seats.ldquoWe are guests here, said Izzy, ldquowe are sitting amongst old ruins, and we must leave them exactly as we found them. Even our wee fire must leave no trace. There used to be a sign here telling people about this place, but people just didnrsquot respect it, theyrsquod damaged it or trash it, so the sign was taken away. We know better, so we are welcome guests.Finn nodded. He initially felt upbraided, but his aunt gave him a kind smile which changed the meaning of her words.Instead of feeling scolded, he felt a strange sense of privilege that hersquod been taught something important.ldquoThink how long this house has been here, said Izzy, who looked up at the gable end with the chimney.ldquoThat standing wall was added later, but it is said Rob built the original house here in . It was a time when he was a hunted outlaw. This was Campbell country when he lived here, but he was under the protection of a Campbell chief, how ironic was that  Robrsquos mother had been a Campbell, and yoursquove seen how MacGregors could be both enemies and family with Campbells.She pointed at the base of the ruins: ldquoThose stones are the foundations of the old walls. Now close your eyes for a moment, Finn. Imagine we are in the house in Robrsquos time. There are no windows, a thatched roof above us and a peat fire is in the middle, with a smoky heat filling the room. Now open your eyes, can you see the house as it used to be Finn opened his eyes and looked around.ldquoYes, I think so.ldquoCan you smell the peat smoke in your imagination ldquoI donrsquot know what it smells like aunty.ldquoItrsquos a sweet smoke.ldquoI smell it now.ldquoNow look up, can you see how the soot from the fire has made the rafters of the roof all black ldquoYeah, itrsquos all sooty.ldquoWe are sitting in the very place of the story, said Izzy. ldquoRight where you are, sat Rob Roy himself.ldquoNo aunty, hersquos next to me, otherwise hersquoll be on my knee, joked Finn.ldquoAll right then, of course, hersquos next to you, chuckled his aunt. She pointed to the small fire crackling in the fire dish.ldquoHersquos looking into the peat fire, thinking about his we and children.

The good news though is that itrsquos very much less likely that you will get covidyoursquore vaccinated, compared to someone who isnrsquot.Even better, in the unlikely event that you do catch Covid after being vaccinated, you are much less likely to get severe symptoms or be hospitalised thanyou had not been vaccinated.The clinical trials for the Pfizer vaccine reported a % efficacy, which means that the number of people who showed symptoms of covid during the time of the trial was % lower in the vaccinated group than in a comparison group who were not vaccinated.Data collected since the trials, as the vaccines have begun to be used widely, has confirmed these numbers, so the vaccines are very effective on a population scale. On a inidual scale, though, there is still a chance that you might be one of the very few people who is vaccinated and still gets infected it is possible, just very much less likely than without a vaccine.One extra point to add here is that the vaccines take time to work.The vaccine is not a instant shot of protection it is a way to train your immune system, so that your immune system will then protect you. It takes - weeks or so for the immune system to respond so, evenyou are someone who has a superb immune response to the vaccine, you are still not protected until - weeks after the jag.Some cases of people being infected with covid after the vaccination are because they were exposed to the virus during this - week window. Be especially cautious during this time.Just as the vaccines make it much less likely that yoursquoll get infected, they also make it much less likely that you will be able to infect others ndash but in both cases the answer is that the chances are much reduced, but not zero.We donrsquot fully understand why some people are fully protected and others are not it might be that you have a slightly quirky immune system, or are immunosuppressed it might be that you are exposed to an unusually high dose of the virus.It might be something in your genes or environment that makes you a particularly good target for the virus.When the first trials were conducted to test how well the vaccines work, the data that was collected measured the number of people who showed symptoms of disease. This number was reduced % in the Pfizer trial.The trials did not attempt to measure whether vaccinated people could still be infectious. We have some really encouraging data now, collected after the trials from countries where vaccines have been used widely, showing that vaccination does also reduce transmission ndash meaning that vaccinated people are less likely to infect others than people who are not vaccinated.This is what we expected and hoped for, and itrsquos really good to see. This is why being vaccinated not only protects ourselves, but also others.Viruses cannot live for long periods on their own they need a person to provide a home.If you are successfully vaccinated, then your body is trained to refuse entry to the virus, denying it that home.When only a few people are vaccinated, the virus can fairly easily find another person, another home to occupy. When very many people are vaccinated, finding a home becomes much more of a challenge, and the virus is condemned to a lonely death outside.The idea of working together by using our immune systems to reduce the number of opportunities that the virus has to gain a foothold and spread is whatrsquos called ldquoherd immunity.Even the rare people in whom the vaccine didnrsquot work very well can be protected this way, as other peoplersquos vaccinations mean that they too are less likely to encounter the virus.No. The importance of a face mask is that it is a barrier to stop you infecting other people.We still need to be cautious to avoid infection, and to avoid infecting others, until the amount of virus circulating in our communities falls.The Covid vaccines are one part of our toolkit for reducing the amount of virus circulating. They make it less likely yoursquoll get infected, less likely yoursquoll get sick, and less likely yoursquoll breathe out the virus and spread it to others.But there is still a small chance that each of these steps can happen, and so facemasks, space and distance are all still needed just now.The gradual easing of restrictions that is beginning just now is possible because wersquove successfully driven case numbers down, in part through the vaccination programme.If we can keep this up, then we will get to a point when case numbers are low enough that restrictions will ease yet further, and facemasks might then become optional in more places.We are optimistic that immunity will last ndash but not yet certain.The first people to receive the Covid vaccines were only vaccinated  months ago, so we know that vaccines can generate immunity that lasts at least  months.We know that the majority of people who have been infected with the SARS-CoV virus, that causes Covid, also have persistent immune cells and good antibody levels, even a year after infection.There was a lot of fear that immunity would not last, and there are been some prominent cases where people have been shown to be infected twice ndash so in those particualr people, immunity was either not persistent or not ever good enough.But for the majority of people, infection has led to persistent immunity, so far.Another piece of encouraging news is that particular immune cells, essential for protection, were still detectable last year in people who were infected in  with SARS, which was a severe infection caused by a similar coronavirus to the one that causes Covid.So we are optimistic, but will only know for certain when more time has passed.Another twist here, is whether immunity generated by having one of the current vaccines will be effective against any virus iants: lasting immunity might not be useful,the virus mutates and can escape that immunity. But there are grounds for optimism here toohellip... There are two situations in which a booster might be useful.The first one isimmunity doesnrsquot last long enough without a booster, and in that case a third jag is definitely a possible solution.The second one isthe virus mutates or ies, and we need to update our vaccines to match the new iants. The coronavirus that causes Covid is one that is known to mutate ndash thatrsquos a normal part of its biology.The flu virus is another example of a virus that we know mutates, and thatrsquos why flu vaccines are updated and given every year.But the Covid vaccines have held up well so far: the vaccines currently being used in the UK were designed against the original version of the virus, but have done very well in reducing disease and blocking transmission of the B.. Kent iant, for example.The immune response generated by the vaccines is strong, and evenit is two fold less effective against a new iant, there is a good chance the remaining immune response will still be enough to prevent severe disease and slow the spread of the virus.Another piece of good news is the way that these new vaccines have been designed makes it a relatively simple process to update them,new iants make that necessary.If we do need boosters, that too should be achievable.The gradual easing of restrictions that have begun now reflects the success of our collective ability to reduce the amount of virus circulating, and getting people fully vaccinated is a large part of this success.I hope that this gradual process will continue as the vaccination programme is completed, and more normality will be achieved in each step.That said, we are still a long way away from everyone having both doses, as we need vaccinations to be completed globally before any inidual country can fully relax.Within the UK, the vaccination programme is currently planned for all adults, but vaccines for teenagers and younger children are only in the stage of clinical trials.Globally, some restrictions on international travel might need to persist until global vaccination rates increase, and those gobal vaccination rates depend on politics and cooperation between nations.Another aspect to this question is what normal really means.The pandemic hit us hard and for people whorsquove been bereaved, who have persistent symptoms or Long Covid, or whose jobs and livelihoods have been affected, normal wonrsquot ever be as it was.And as communities, there are also changes both good and bad.Will hand sanitiser provision in supermarkets continue  Will working from home always be more possible  Will high streets rejuvenate  There are opportunities for change here,we want to grasp them but there may also need to be time to heal and recover."},{"url":null,"title":"work-progressing-400-home-development-longniddry","story":"Work at the site ndash being marketed as lsquoLongniddry Villagersquo ndash has been ongoing for more than a year.The East Coast Main Line railway is all that separates the new development from the existing Longniddry settlement.But the site of the new homes is actually where lsquooldrsquo Longniddry once stood, hence its lsquoLongniddry Villagersquo name.This week, ZeroC, part of Places for People, opened the doors to its new show home in the development.Longniddry Village is being developed in partnership with landowners Wemyss and March Estates.Maps dating back to the s show that half of the old village of Longniddry was to the south of where the railway now runs, on the site of the present Longniddry Farm.When John Glassell acquired most of the lands of the village in , the pace of change increased and many of the remaining houses and buildings in the village were cleared for agriculture.The railway arrived in  and land previously owned by Mr Glassell was passed firstly to the House of Argyll and then to the Wemyss and March Estates, with the many new homes being built to the north of the railway line in the s.Allison Sutherland, regional sales and marketing director for Places for People in Scotland, said: ldquoItrsquos been an exciting time for Places for People to deliver our first ZeroC development in East Lothian, which delivers a fresh approach to building homes in the area.

So, with Secrets Of The Whales, it was really about bringing people into the lives of these whales.Are humans and whales more similar than we think Weve often been very clinical and how we view wildle - we see ourselves apart from it or above it. Butwe begin to understand that whales have personality, they give each other names, they isolate by dialect, they have singing competitions, they have food preferences, they mourn their dead, they do all of these things that used to be thought of as only the domain of humans but are not so. So, were sharing this planet with this alien intellectual species that does things much like we do.Is there anything that might surprise viewers So, in the place whereare catching sea lion pups, Patagonia, theyre the only orca in the world that do that. The orca in New Zealand are eating stingrays and the ones in the Norwegian Arctic are eating herring. So, its this ethnic food preferences, international cuisine, that makes that culture.How did Avatar director James Cameron become involved in the project I knew Jim - we had met several times over the years, I think there was a bit of mutual respect I certainly had great admiration for his genius and his work. He is a National Geographic Explorer... Hes a master storyteller. He can create everything from fictional characters and scenes and sets and story narratives, he can invent the equipment thats needed to film it in D and do things that havent been done before. But hes also a pioneering ocean explorer who, you know, builds his own submarines and goes to the deepest part of the ocean to understand.And you managed to get Alien and Avatar actress Sigourney Weaver involved Bringing in Sigourney Weaver as the narrator was fantastic. I always thought that would have been fantastic because that female voice, especially for these whales, that are often led by females, was brilliant. So yeah, on every level, it was sort of organic.At one point, we see you intervene and help a trapped orca do you ever worry about upsetting the natural balance of the oceans How can humans play their part in helping save the oceans We have to realise that all of our actions have consequences. That we dont live on this planet in a vacuum, that we are intricately connected to nature and everything we do matters. Were dumping  billion pounds of plastic every year into the ocean, and weve lost % of the big fish in the ocean post-World War Two and weve lost half the worlds coral reefs... It can be as simple as finding better ways of fishing and not having vertical lines that animals get entangled in - and thats going to take some collaborative efforts. Or it could be just being better consumers, informed consumers, voting for people who care about conservation and science.Does the feeling of awe ever wear off when you interact with these ocean giants I mean, it never gets old -anything, its addictive. Ive been doing this for decades and every year I swear, it gets better. As a young boy, I had dreams and fantasies of doing this kind of thing and you have certain preconceived notions, but the reality ends up being better than those fantasies... You have to get the footage, but theres a scene in the sperm whale film where I put my camera down - Im playing with a six-month-old calf out in the middle of the ocean. And at some point, you just have to stop working and just soak it up.Secrets Of The Whales from National Geographic premieres on Earth Day, Thursday, on Disney+"},{"url":null,"title":"recipe-asparagus-guanciale-carbonara-creamy-sublime-flavour","story":"Try this familiar pasta dish with guanciale, Tuscan smoked pigsrsquo cheek.

Seriously, Ms Sturgeon was making a pertinent point. Which is that a staged fight over who is the most avid for independence might momentarily amuse the zealous, as they formed a ring, chanting ldquofight, fight, fight.She noted, however, that it would do nothing to impress those who remain unpersuaded by the merits of independence in the first place. They might simply turn away, faintly nauseated.Which is why the leitmot of Ms Sturgeonrsquos launch was continuity. As it has been for the entire campaign thus far.That seems to me particularly apt this week. Today brings the funeral service for the Duke of Edinburgh. The arrangements are, inevitably and rightly, suppressed by Covid.But, still, the gathering at Windsor offers a visible reminder of the core constitutional continuity presented by the Royal Family, alongside the collective desire to give thanks for a le of long and devoted service.Events occasionally conspire, Oprah Winfrey et al, to make many of us contemplate the Royal Family asthey were stars in a soap opera, a source of innocent merriment or exaggerated empathy.They are, of course, much more. They are ldquothe firm. They are the much-altered but still salient Royal prerogative. They are the palpable core of the United Kingdom.When party leaders at Holyrood paid tribute this week, it was left to Patrick Harvie of the Greens to note, en passant, that support for the institution of Monarchy was not universal in Scotland. However, he subsumed this Republican thought beneath personal sympathy for the Queen and her family.:Coronavirus: From Indias double mutant to vaccine hesitancy and the supply slowdownNicola Sturgeon sounded a genuine, personal note as she evinced admiration for the wit and intellect of the Duke, whom she met frequently at Balmoral and where. They shared, she disclosed, an intense interest in books.But her general theme was, again, one of continuity. The Dukersquos role as a constant companion to the Queen, the cherry trees they planted in the grounds of Canongate Kirk, which she hoped would thrive and bloom for many years.Of all the sundry institutions which comprise the UK State, it has long struck me that the Palace gets devolution best. Perhaps alongside the Foreign and Commonwealth Office which, as one mandarin once told me with a wry grin, is well used to dealing with troublesome colonies.The Palace appreciates the need to work with the UKrsquos devolved apparatus. For example, the Sovereign regularly travels to her palace of Holyroodhouse to welcome new First Ministers from over the road, rather than obliging them to sojourn to London.While representing continuity, the Palace is adaptable. Within limits, it moves with the times, often cajoled down the decades by the Duke of Edinburgh. The Queenrsquos own speeches to the Scottish Parliament constantly endorse devolved governance.However, the Queen has also been known, very occasionally, to express disquiet at potential constitutional change.In , as Scottish devolution was under active discourse, the Sovereign said she could readily understand such aspirations but could not forget that she was ldquocrowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.More recently, in , days before the independence referendum, the Queen was also in contemplative mood, perhaps prompted by advisers. Asked about the ballot by a by-stander outside Crathie Kirk, she said that she hoped people would think very carefully about the future.Nicola Sturgeon thoroughly understands this nuanced approach by the wary Palace to the malleable UK constitution.She studiously avoids placing any question marks against the Regal Union of . She is not about to pick a fight, arm wrestling or otherwise, with the Monarchy.However, she does maintain a standing challenge to the Parliamentary Union of . She does want, in the word of the moment, to affect transformational change there.Yet she also understands that, right now, the people of Scotland remain deeply, deeply apprehensive and unsure about their future.:Kevin McKenna: Recover from the virus and a referendum  We can do bothThey contemplate the pandemic, this hideous plague, and they fret. They also cast their minds back to the banking crisis of , from which we have yet to recover. They consider too the disruption of Brexit, which may or may not resolve itself.Folk need reassurance. Which is precisely what Nicola Sturgeon was attempting to offer this week, most notably with regard to indyref but also in her policies on income tax.Ms Sturgeon declared that tackling Covid must come first, with indyref on hold until the middle of the new Parliament. She opts for popular pragmatism. She calculates that there is little to be gained from evoking the spirit of William Wallace, or even Robert the Bruce.Once more, it is easy to understand why this might exasperate the most eager adherents of the independence cause. Incidentally, it also irks the Conservatives who yearn for constitutional wrestling arms, feet, whatever.This week, also, there was some passing interest in a poll which suggested that fewer than one in five of the Scottish population ranked independence as among the most important issues at this election.That did not surprise me. Constitutional questions, even independence, are generally second order matters, unless a population is actively experiencing oppression, either physical or spiritual.By ldquosecond order, I do not remotely intend to say that such matters are unimportant.

Theyrsquove re-tuned the political consciousness of Middle England.Once there was an assumption, even amongst the most cynical of us, that after overweening ambition and self-aggrandisement politicians still retained a desire deep within their beings to serve the public.

David Cameron and his family are already rich beyond the imaginations of the overwhelming majority of voters in this country. Did he not feel just a little tawdry and humiliated as he went from minister to minister advisor to advisor, seeking favour for his billionaire clients  Perhaps his reported bonus of pound million carried him well past the point where self-esteem ceases to be a consideration.Was Health Secretary Matt Hancock so driven by a desire to wring every penny of financial leverage from his limited time in a great office of state that he didnrsquot consider his stake in a NHS-approved contractor to be immoral  Perhaps, having observed how ineffective Keir Starmerrsquos Labour opposition has been, they felt that the public were there for the taking without any consequences. After all their friends and colleagues who helped themselves to multi-million PPE contracts seem not to have encountered any backlash in the polls.Labour politicians in the Tony Blair era were slightly more circumspect in the process of capitalising on their time in office. Blair himself built a massive property portfolio while pimping himself out as a sort of international, travelling peace salesman. In office, Blair committed British troops to seven wars, all of which provided him with ample opportunity to make the connections in the Arab world that would provide a few extra zeroes in his pension.

But now the privatising zeal of Margaret Thatcher has combined with Boris Johnsonrsquos contracts for cronies, to make this size issue more extreme.There are a lot more contracts knocking about and theyrsquove grown steadily larger, more complex and consequently lie even further beyond the reach of local firms.Big is automatically seen as a guarantor of success ndash even though banks that were \"too big\" did fail and small countries, with ultra-local government and a highly developed instinct for self-reliance have been held up as exemplars during the pandemic.EU procurement rules have been blamedfor carving local suppliers out, since contracts over a certain size had to be advertised across the whole European Union.

Even the ones who end up in jail somehow manage to keep the nice car, nice house, nice holidays, and find a nice gig on the board of some unscrupulous company once the prison unorm comes off. Theyrsquore like rubber balls ndash always rebounding.Largely thatrsquos because Holyrood and the House of Commons are like universities back in the good old days of the full grant. We pay politicians handsomely to go to parliament, where they learn all sorts of handy skills that prove very lucrative for le after office: how to navigate public contracts, deal with civil servants, avoid scrutiny, who to suck up to, which palms to grease and with what particular unction.When their careers end ndash in ignominy and failure as most iniably do ndash politicians know theyrsquore a strong commodity to peddle to the highest bidder. So eventheyrsquove seen the inside of a jail, therersquos always some shyster whorsquoll realise an ex-politician is a valuable asset for the payroll.Therein lies the formula for the lobbying industry and its relationship with former politicians: we pay politiciansrsquo salaries so they can skill up and flog their newfound talents to the highest bidder once theyrsquove left office, and their new paymasters can then rip off the taxpayer and exploit our democracy. A nice little earneryou can get it for all concerned ndash ordinary folk excluded obviously.You can tell that politics is a business in which politicians write the rules. Wersquore schmucks letting them get away with it. For proof of our collective schmuckhood, we once again, for the umpteenth time, find ourselves in the middle of a lobbying scandal: this time the Greensill affair.Itrsquos a vile swamp. Former Prime Minister David Cameron became an adviser for the finance firm Greensill after he left office. He was reportedly given share options worth tens of millions. Cameron contacted ministers, included chancellor Rishi Sunak, trying to get Greensill the largest possible allocation of government-backed loans under the Covid corporate financing facility. Cameron also took company boss Lex Greensill to private drinks with health secretary Matt Hancock. Lex Greensill previously had a role as lsquosenior advisorrsquo to Cameron when he was PM ndash a role in which Greensill was reportedly allowed to pitch financial projects across Whitehall.: Democracy in dangerThe scandal has thrown up all sorts of unpleasant truths, including the fact that civil servants are allowed to work for private industry while in office. Bill Crothers, former head of Whitehall procurement, became an adviser to Greensill while still employed by the civil service. John Manzoni, chief executive of the civil service, was allowed to keep a poundk a year job as a non-executive director of the company SABMiller.The stink isnrsquot confined to Westminster. Fergus Ewing, SNP rural economy secretary, had an unrecorded dinner with Lex Greensill, and steel billionaire Sanjeev Gupta. Wersquore told there were no officials with Ewing, no notes were taken. The government claims to have no emails, texts or phone records about happened. Deals struck between the SNP government, Gupta and Greensill exposed taxpayers to hundreds of millions of pounds of debt after Greensill collapsed. The ministerial code states that officials should be present for any discussions relating to government business, with facts recorded. Nicola Sturgeon claimsthat dinners which Fergus Ewing attended are ldquovery dferent from David Cameronrsquos antics and the SNP said that \"attempts to make mischief around this issue are utterly baseless.Inevitably, therersquos going to be a Greensill inquiry ndash there always is when one of these scandals erupts. But donrsquot expect anything to change. It never does. After all,wersquod learned anything from previous scandals, Greensill wouldnrsquot have happened. Nigel Boardman, appointed by Boris Johnson to run the inquiry, is on the board of a private bank with close ties to the Tory party and a number of former civil servants in its ranks.We can, however, nip all this in the bud immediately, and end the scandal of political lobbying once and for all. The one simple way to stop this gross exploitation of the public is to ban anyone whorsquos ever held political office from lobbying on behalf of business interests for le. Soyoursquove served one single day as an elected representative, yoursquore barred from lobbying your former colleagues on behalf of any corporate interest. No more Sir Nick Clegg working as Facebookrsquos lobbyist, for instance. We could go as far as banning politicians from all lobbying, but some has decent intent. It would be draconian to prevent lobbying for a charity, for instance ndash as long as that lobbying is done openly and without profit.: Where is the vision Therersquos some other changes we also need to clean up public le. The definition of what lobbying is needs to be claried in Scotland to ensure that all forms of communication are covered, and that politicians canrsquot wriggle out of scrutiny by playing semantics around what a lsquomeetingrsquo actually means. At the moment thatrsquos not clear, and lobbyists have been exploiting loopholes which require only lsquovisual interactionsrsquo to be registered. Phone calls and emails donrsquot have to be registered. Lobbying rules should also extend to civil servants ndash theyrsquore not covered by the register.So is change likely  The omens donrsquot look good. The SNP has a host of former big wigs working as lobbyists so I wouldnrsquot set any store in the party suddenly finding its moral conscience. The Tories basically invented the revolving door between lobbying and public le. When it comes to Labour, the MSP who led the charge in Holyrood against lobbying scandals, Neil Findlay, appeared to court companies to hire him as a lobbyist in advance of him standing down at this election.However, change is down to us. If we donrsquot order the politicians ndash whose salaries we pay ndash to legislate for the public standards we expect, then wersquoll have nobody to blame but ourselves when the next Greensill scandal inevitably happens.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Id rather watch the dads playing park football ndash theres a lot more goals for a start. So I was supremely indferent to the news that some English clubs with more money than sense had decided to join a breakaway European Super League. Better off without them.However, the mega-stushie in the beautul game has now taken on an unexpected political signicance.

MACWHIRTER:Alba needs a U-turn after its car crash campaignThe European Super League has nothing whatever to do with the European Union, but it does with something underlying it: globalisation. It is part of the relentless march of capitalist expansion across national borders, leaving the little people behind. And there has been a hint of Brexit in the way commentators have condemned the mega clubs for betraying their country and community. Pundits on the left have been sounding like Nigel Farage wondering whatever happened to patriotism and loyalty to ones own.It is all about money, of course. The founding clubs will reportedly share pound billion courtesy of JP Morgan, which is one of the mega banks now financing Big Footie. This is to help them adjust to the rarefied atmosphere of global football, and is absolutely not intended as a bribe, or to buy the lads a drink. It is also to cover their vast debts.Fans and football governing bodies like UEFA are furious. The left-behind clubs stand to lose a heap of money by not being included in this European Super League. Politicians and football celebrities like Gary Lineker are attacking the breakaway clubs for disrespecting the fans and for polluting the Peoples Game with filthy lucre.There is, it has to be said, just a hint of hypocrisy in this outrage from wealthy ex-players and managers. British football is hardly a model of affordable community sport. The Premier league is all about money ndash mainly TV cash ndash which has been used to pay ludicrous sums to the primping prima donnas of the pitch. The main reason the sports personalities and clubs are worried now is that some of their money will be creamed off by the super leaguers.Defenders of the ESL say its just the way the game is going in the age of globalisation. They claim that many of the big clubs, far from minting it, are actually dicing with bankruptcy. This is partly because of Covid, but mainly because of the huge debts they have incurred trying to maintain their standing in the world and keep their fans happy. To survive, the top clubs need to cash in on that global status. Playing a wet Wednesday in Stoke doesnt make it.READMORE MACWHIRTER:Sturgeonrsquos border problem could possibly kill Yes vote stone deadThe fans arent entirely innocent bystanders here.

Superstar Lionel Messis contract with FC Barcelona is worth over poundm a year. This may help explain why the world-famous club is in pound.bn in debt.Of course, theres a simple answer to that cash flow problem: just dont pay them. But that doesnt work in the global sports marketplace, apparently. From the point of view of clubs like Manchester United, who apparently have more fans in India than in England, it is all about giving their viewers what they want. It is no more objectionable, they say, than rock bands performing in mega stadiums on world tours. No one says the Rolling Stones are abandoning their fans and following the money.If people keep paying, the Super League will probably happen, sooner or later, whatever the politicians say. As for Scottish football ndash well, nothing to see here since no team in Scotland is remotely in contention. Which in many ways is a very good thing. Every few years there are rumours about Rangers and Celtic plotting to join the English Premier league on the grounds that they cant afford to continue in the small pond of Scottish football. But it never seems to happen.This could be an opportunity for Scottish football to go precisely the other way: become a sport which was more about local fellowship than global finance. Be more like the Jags. Partick Thistle is one of a small but growing number of Scottish clubs that are owned by their supporters. Mind you that was because of the generosity of the late Colin Weir, who essentially bought the club to give it to the fans.

Often, too, these nations are viewed by outsiders as either the devil incarnate, or as beacons of hope, depending on an inidualrsquos political take on the world.Cuba is such a country, and like any that has impacted on our modern global political landscape, key dates have become signposts in tracking its most pivotal moments.This week two dates were marked in Cubarsquos national diary that have their origins in events of  years ago. The first was the anniversary of the now infamous Bay of Pigs invasion when on April , , a force of nearly , men, secretly aided by Americarsquos CIA and Navy, stormed southern Cuba in an undercover operation that sent political around shockwaves around the world.Subsequently it would be recognised as one of the biggest blunders in the history of US intelligence operations. That failed Cold War operation was of course aimed at toppling the rule of Fidel Castrorsquos communist revolutionary government that itself had previously overthrown the government of Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista in .Ever since then Cuba has been led by a Castro until earlier this week, as the second of those historical dates for the national diary was realised, when Fidelrsquos brother Raul Castro left the political stage ceding power to a younger generation who face fresh challenges in the face of Cubarsquos dire economic crisis and growing political dissent.In this Cuba after the Castros, that job now falls to Miguel Diaz-Canel who on Monday was elected as First Secretary of the ruling Communist Party and effective head of state.Mr Diaz-Canel is a man who has risen steadily through the ranks of Cubarsquos bureaucracy with a reputation as a capable but cautious leader focused on economic reform.But those thinking his appointment marks a signicant break in the political continuity of the Castro years should think again. Raul Castro after all was determined, as highlighted in a recent speech, to leave ldquoa foot in a stirrup ready to defend socialism, and that is pretty much what has happened.That said, Mr Diaz-Canal is of a dferent breed from his revolutionary guerilla comandante forbears who seized power in  and have since all died or aged. An engineer by training and said by Cuba watchers to lack the political charisma of the Castro brothers, Mr Diaz-Canel nevertheless might just yet bring the political skillset needed to see Cuba through the rocky phase itrsquos now undergoing.Those looking for a more signicant sht away from Cubarsquos one-party state system donrsquot see it that way however, already casting Mr Diaz-Canel as just another lsquoCastrorsquo appointee and apparatchik.This burbling dissent among some of the  million people who make up this small country, whose political history and influence punch way above its size, is only one of the key issues Mr Diaz-Canel must keep an eye on right now. Not least given that such rumblings are inextricably connected to Cubarsquos wider substantial economic woes which in turn have been compounded by the coronavirus pandemic.For many Cubans, particularly those of a younger generation, the time they spent thinking about Mr Diaz-Canelrsquos appointment was probably considerably shorter than they spend daily queuing to secure basic foodstuffs and necessities.Vital imports such as food, fuel and raw materials fell  per cent and the economy contracted  per cent in , according to the government. Cuba imports more than  per cent of the food it consumes and tourism, a key source of income, was decimated by the pandemic.Other outside political factors, too, compound Cubarsquos economic problems as they always have, not least US sanctions. Few US leaders have had it in for Cuba as much as former president Donald Trump. It was Mr Trump that derailed one of Raoul Castrorsquos most signicant achievements, the  detente with the Obama administration.To date, Joe Bidenrsquos administration while reviewing the Trump policy, including his branding of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism, has shown little interest in moving on relations with Havana, but then again Mr Biden has his work cut out where, not least at home.Mr Bidenrsquos apparent hesitancy over Cuba has only prompted the countryrsquos exiles and dissidents, notably the noisy oppositional cabal in Miami, to demand the US president continues to turn the screw on Havana. Meanwhile the opposition itself via social media urges Cubans to revolt in what it regards as a collapsing country.Bad as its economic plight might be though, Cuba has been here before. Whether one admires or loathes what its government represents and its track record on issues like human rights, Cuba has shown itself time and again to be a remarkable political survivor. Cubans may grumble about the country and its failure to improve their lot but equally they are fiercely proud of what they have achieved.That said, the fault line for the future many well prove to be a generational one. While those remaining of the Castro years remember Batistarsquos dictatorship and remain loyal to the revolution, some among a younger generation while benefitting from the free education and a remarkable health system that came from socialism, do expect, and want more.Understandable as such frustration is, young Cubans might prove wrong to view such past achievements altogether negatively or dismiss them lightly. Cubarsquos long history of top-class medical research for example has stood it in relatively good stead during the pandemic.Currently its research teams have five vaccine candidates, and one, the Soberana , appears to be highly effective and is entering the final stage of clinical trials.If successful, Cuba would be the first Latin American country to make its own vaccine, no mean feat when compared to the disastrous response in some neighbouring regional giants like Brazil.Last Monday, when Raul Castro retired, he had a warning for this nation that in so many ways has long been an outlier. His warning spoke to a country increasingly ided over the legacy of its famous communist revolution: The choice at hand is continuity of the revolutionrsquos ideals, or defeat. Only time will tell which Mr Diaz-Canel, and his fellow Cubans will choose, but whatever they decide it will, as ever, certainly resonate.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Just like so many other people of colour.What should have been a moment of relief, a moment for us to take a breath, was a moment where we couldnt. We all saw the video footage. We all saw an innocent man being murdered, and yet, we did not knowthe correct verdict was going to be reached. This alone displays the iota of trust we have in the criminal justice system. Rest assured,the roles were reversed andGeorge Floyd was white and Derek Chauvin was black, there would have been nothing anxious to wait about. That doesnt seem like justice to me.We cannot afford to now overlook the fact that this verdict remains an out layer. We cannot forget that getting to the point we are at now has been an exhaustive process. It has taken a worldwide outcry and video recorded evidence to get us here. If not for all our efforts, the result of this trial would have been very dferent. As history has told us time and time again,black people do not make their voices heard, justice will not be served.:President Biden hails giant step forward in the march toward justice in America after Chauvin convictionSo, yes, pause, take a sigh of relief, celebrate this rare occasion. But it stands to remain a RARE occasion. Derek Chauvin will go down as only the eighth officer found guilty since .That is not justice.Yet, most disheartening of all is that at a time of what was meant to be a small victory for people of colour worldwide. We were forced to mourn the loss of yet another innocent soul. As the guilty verdict was announced, MaKhia Bryant, a -year-old girl, was shot dead by police in Ohio. Derek Chauvin was not just one bad apple the whole system is rotten. Although the jury reached the correct verdict, on this rare occasion, we cannot allow this to replace the much-needed change.Yet, not all hope is lost. This verdict can be the catalyst we need for much-needed change not only in America but in Scotland. Whether we will use it as such is a dferent story. We all ought to be wary of people switching the narrative to \"you see the right verdict has been reached, you can trust the system\". Yet, in reality,the system were so good, we would not have had to rely on a -year-old girl filming the incident to have had the police being held accountable. If the system were so good, the best verdict would have been George Floyd alive.:Painfully earned justice: Police officer found guilty of murdering George FloydOn this occasion, the harsh reality is that what happened in America is something that, to date, Scotland has not been able to replicate. Because right here in Scotland, Sheku Bayoh was killed in police custody. Six years on, we have failed to hold anybody accountable. In England, the recent race report published denied allegations of institutionalised racism. We live in a country where we still deny racism. So, it seems to me we need to be learning from America.In my opinion, education remains one of our panaceas to racism because racism thrives on ignorance. The only way to fight ignorance is through education. What children cannot learn at home must be taught in the classroom. If people cannot even begin to understand the context of racism, we are fighting in a losing battle because how do you even begin to fight what you do not know."},{"url":null,"title":"tokyo-olympics-taking-knee-set-outlawed","story":"Two thirds of respondents to a survey relating to a potential change of the IOCrsquos Rule , which bans demonstrations of ldquopolitical, religious or racial propaganda on Olympic sites, said they did not feel such protests were appropriate.Athletesrsquo Commission chair Kirsty Coventry said: ldquoA very clear majority of athletes said that itrsquos not appropriate to demonstrate or express their views on the field of play, at the official ceremonies, or on the podium, and so our recommendation is to preservefrom any kind of protests and demonstrations or acts perceived as such.A total of , athletes representing  countries and  sports responded to the survey, as part of a -month consultation process initiated by the widespread social and racial justice movements in the United States.Coventry said the recommendation ndash which Bach confirmed had been ldquounanimously approved ndash would now be passed to the IOCrsquos legal affairs commission in order to consider the range of potential sanctions against those who fail to adhere to the rule.Coventry added: ldquoWe are asking the legal affairs commission to come up with a proportionate range of dferent sanctions, so that everyone knows going into a Games what they can and canrsquot do.

The most striking feature is the patch of white at their rump. Males are slightly smaller and pale grey with black wingtips. Both have a round, owl-like face.Hen harriers are the UK#s most persecuted bird of prey relative to its population size. Their Scottish population is of global importance, yet it remains far from stable largely as a result of illegal killing by humans.The RSPB’s Jenni Burrell said: “We are calling on the public to email our Hen Harrier Hotlinethey believe they’ve seen a hen harrier. This helps us build a picture of where these birds are. Please don’t hesitate to contact usyou see them # we welcome any sightings and appreciate your time.“Hen harriers are beautul and elusive raptors and, unlike peregrines and kestrels, they are rarely seen in urban environments. Soit’s perched on your fence, it’s probably a sparrowhawk,it’s in a tree by the roadside, it’s probably a kestrel or a buzzard… butit’s over rough pasture or moorland, and matches the description above, then you might have seen a hen harrier.“Sadly hen harriers are a long way from reaching a healthy, self-sustaining population, and this is largely down to persecution by humans. Particularly where land is managed for the purpose of driven grouse shooting, natural predators like hen harriers can be viewed as pests and, despite being legally protected, the shooting, trapping and poisoning of hen harriers is a serious and ongoing problem.”If you think you’ve seen a hen harrier, you are asked to email henharriers@rspb.org.uk and to include the date, time, location grid reference and a description of the bird.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I know that many will be looking forward ndash quite rightly ndash to their first drink in a beer garden, to catching up with a friend in a cafeacute, or to going on holiday somewhere in Scotland.ldquoBut even as we enjoy those moments, we still need to be careful.

Yetwe continue using coal, oil and gas at the current rate, estimates show that reserves will be gone in around  years. But this is the least of our worries. If we want to slow rising global temperatures we need to stop burning these fuels their combustion, and subsequent release of greenhouse gases, is the main driver behind global warming.In , the Scottish Government pledged to end the use of all fossil fuels by  in order to reach their zero net emissions target. And in their place  Renewables.The traditional options such as wind farms and hydro schemes have now been joined by green hydrogen. Although still in its infancy, this renewable gas is expected to be a leading source of future energy production. Naturally occurring hydrogen is obtained by passing electricity through waterthis electricity is renewably sourced the gas is labelled as ‘green’ hydrogen, as opposed to ‘grey’. Once extracted it can be used in existing gas pipelines to heat and power homes, fuel vehicles and drive heavy machinery.And unlike traditional gas, when burned it produces no harmful emissions, only water.Keith Masson, climate change and energy team manager at Highland Council, said: “We’re in the process of recruiting a project manager to lead on the delivery of new hydrogen and low carbon heat strategies, to ensure that the council and the wider Highland region benefits from the energy-systems transformation that these technologies will bring.”In Highland region, plans are underway for a ‘hydrogen hub’ in the Cromarty Firth. Electricity generated from wind turbines in the area will be used to produce hydrogen gas for use in local industries.But progress towards the net zero emissions target is also happening even closer to home. In the last few months plans have been confirmed for two community hydro developments in Skye and Lochalsh.Construction of a community owned kW micro hydro development in Sleat is due to begin this month. Electricity produced will be sold to the national grid with over £, expected to be generated in the first  years. All money generated will be used to fund sustainable projects in the local community.Kenny Nicolson, project officer for Sleat Community Hydro, said: “Despite the Gàidhealtachd being a huge exporter of renewable energy, we pay the highest prices for electricity with some of the worst rates of fuel poverty in the UK. On Skye we have issues with inequality, young people unable to find secure employment and housing, and a dying language and culture.“Community-owned renewable energy projects are not just a means for reducing carbon emissions, there is a massive potential to create community wealth and address some of these underlying issues.”We as iniduals can also take steps towards installing renewable energy sources. The process may seem complicated or costly but thanks to an initiative launched by the Scottish Government, homeowners can apply for  per cent cashback, up to £,, for a renewable heating system. Small and medium sized businesses are also eligible for a similar cashback grant scheme. And the options for renewable heating systems are vast, from biomassboilers to solar  and ground source heat pumps.Iain Stewart and Shelagh Parlane have a ground source heat pump which sits just below the surface in their garden in Edinbane, extracting warmth from the ground to heat their radiators, underfloor heating and water. Shelagh said: “I would absolutely recommend it. It is certainly a very efficient system. If you were trying to heat water in a standard way I think it would be much more expensive.”Renewable heating systems can also be a source of income with the UK government’s Renewable Heat Initiative scheme. If you install, or have installed in the last year, an eligible system you could receive quarterly cash payments over seven years.Of course, no energy source is completely harmless. Whether it is birds flying into wind turbines or the destruction of fish spawning grounds with a hydro scheme, everything has a cost. Butwe want to continue using electricity, fossil fuels are not the way forward.No birds or fish will be able to survive at allwe continue to exacerbate the greenhouse gas effect by burning coal, oil and gas.Green alternatives are no longer trials for the future of energy production, they are the future."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MV-Glenachulish2.jpg","title":"glenelg ferry back in service in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine• Bittersweetafter death of founding directorFerry company directors took the decision not to operate the service for the  season in the interests of public and crew safety during the Covid pandemic.The vessel, MV Glenachulish, which normally runs from Easter to mid-October, has been tied up at the Kishorn boat yard since the autumn of .This week, general manager Jo Crawford from Glenelg said the boat was undergoing final checks and it was hoped to resume the service on Saturday st May.“It was a big miss last year, for locals and visitors alike,” said Ms Crawford.“We have put in additional measures to comply with Covid regulations including sanitising stations at both slipways and all the crew have been issued with PPE.“We have secured some grant assistance for opening up again and the ferry’s  employees will be taken out of furlough.

What is not as well-known about Alastair though, is that he had strong family connections with Skye, which he never forgot.Alastair MacPherson Alexander, to give him his full name, was born on th November , in Parklea, Port Glasgow. He died on Sunday th March, aged .Alastair was intensely proud of his home area of the Port and wider Inverclyde but was also acutely aware of his roots in Skye. He is one of a long list of people in that area who could trace his lineage to the island and the remarkable tale of serendipity and genealogy which eventually saw him commentate on Skye Camanachd’s greatest day in  bears further examination.Alastair’s maternal grandmother Jessie MacPherson was born in Skye in . His mother, Marion Smith, was born in Skye and lived at Tarskavaig in Sleat where her father was a shepherd. Following a well-trodden path, they moved to Kilmacolm in Renfrewshire for work.And it was farming and work on the land which brought Alastair’s parents together. Walter Alexander’s family had Bogston Farm in Greenock and eventually Marion and Walter met and married. Walter was to live with sight and hearing loss and they were, understandably, huge influences –clearly demonstrated in Alastair’s subsequent voluntary work with the Rex Blind Parties, while he developed a remarkable affection for shinty through his connection with Skye.Incidentally, Marion’s father moved to Renton, won the football pools, bought the show house in Dumbuck Crescent, Dumbarton and called it Tarskavaig. It was there that Alastair’s grandmother Jessie died in  when he was seven years old. Her sister Annie MacPherson , whom Alastair Alexander visited in Skye, was known locally as ‘Annag Alasdair’ denoting her father’s identity, and was single all her le. She lived at No. Tarskavaig, and is well remembered by people in the area today.Alastair met his family circumstances head on with a resilience and fortitude, marking him out as a thoroughly decent human inidual, as well as a consummate professional in more than one area of le.He went to the Glasgow School of Art to train as an architect and pursued a career in the building industry, while maintaining his other interests – moving seamlessly in all his dferent spheres of activity.Forty years of Alastair’s le were spent commentating on more than , football matches and describing bowls, hockey at the Kelvin Hall, and athletics for BBC Scotland, as well as the shinty. He first started commentating for people with vision loss at Love Street, Paisley in .Six years later he asked the BBC for an audition and was on television the following week.It was a great privilege to share commentary duties with the great man in my own early days as a commentator, beginning in  in Oban on a blisteringly hot day. I learned a great deal from him over the next few years and he was fantastic to work with.Technology, or more accurately a digger, failed us together one famous day in  when Fort William scored a goal in less than ten seconds and went on to win the Camanachd Cup -. Few in Fort William were aware of the outcome until much later in the day —there were no mobile phones — as a digger had uprooted the cable which connected Old Anniesland to the BBC studios at Queen Margaret Drive. Alastair and I blethered away for the whole match not knowing that only a few minutes had been broadcast and Tiger Tim had filled the rest of the afternoon with records.One of Alastair’s cousins, Ann McCarron, recalled: “My brother and Alastair spent a lot of their youth together on the Skye holidays and at Gran and Grandpa Smith’s in Dumbuck Crescent. Apparently my brother Alistair had a Subbuteo football game and when they played he [Alastair] used to do the commentating, so he must have had the commentating in his blood!”Such was the family’s affection for Skye that Ann’s brother Alistair’s ashes were scattered on Skye following his death a few years ago.Tributes have been fulsome and sincere. The plaudits and anecdotes could fill Hampden. Alastair was a “gentleman and a true professional” according to Ken MacQuarrie who made the formal presentation to him on behalf of the BBC in .It was singularly appropriate that he commentated on Skye’s greatest triumph in . In that famous final Alastair described Skye’s Calum Murchison on the radio as “leaping around like a salmon”. That of course meant an awful lot more to anyone knowing the shape and size of Calum and also his family’srelationship with the local salmon fishing river in Bernisdale.Alastair was a great man and is a huge loss to our collective knowledge of our history, sport and broadcasting. Meticulous in his presentation and fastidious when it came to detail, he was a total professional. The BBC bid him farewell with the traditional microphone presentation in October  when he retired.We shall not see his like again and we know that Alastair will of course be most sorely missed by his daughters Shirley, Susan and Joyce, her husband Mark, granddaughter Alex and grandson Callum."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/POT-HOLES-KYLE-1-scaled.jpg","title":"kyle womans petition targets","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIona MacLachlan says people are being forced to drive in the opposite carriageway in Kyle’s Main Street to avoid huge potholes and believes a bad accident is waiting to happen.Ms MacLachlan, of Heathmount, is asking people to sign her petition on the change.org online petitions , urging Highland Council to improve the roads in the busy village.The health and social care frontline worker said: “I’ve raised this petition because of an experience I had at the weekend as an L-driver.“I was driving down to the village and I was confronted with this car in the middle of the road. I nearly hit it. I understand why the car was there – the driver was trying to avoid the massive potholes all along the street. I was able to avoid the vehicle but it gave me a scare and this situation could easily result in a bad accident.”Ms MacLachlan has reported the potholes in the road to Highland Council on multiple occasions.She said: “All you get is for the potholes to be filled with gravel and with the bad weather we’ve had over the past few months that lasts only two or three days and then they’re as bad as ever. The road needs to be properly repaired.“I’ve had to replace coil springs and tyres on my car because of the state of the roads in Kyle and I’m fed up with it. I hope as many people as possible will sign the petition to send a strong message to the council.”Ms MacLachlan’s petition is on the change.org site and calls for “All B roads in Kyle of Lochalsh to be repaired”.Local Highland councillor Biz Campbell said she was aware of the petition and agreed the road was in a poor state.“I don’t blame people,” said Councillor Campbell. “The roads are horrendous. We fight for funds for roads all the time and make the case when the budget comes up, but council doesn’t have the money.”However, she said councillors in Ward  — Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh — had been allocated an extra £, for local projects and members had discussed buying a “hot box” tar machine.She explained: “Currently the potholes in this ward are filled with cold tar and it’s a complete waste of money because the tar is simply washed out and the repair doesn’t last.“This machine would allow hot tar repairs to be made to potholes and it would last longer. We have discussed it at a meeting and I think this could achieve better road repairs which would help road users at least in the short term.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/salmon_farmJPG-1.jpg","title":"region should be more than a playground for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWhat is also very clear is that the impacts of the pandemic are extremely unequal, with the young having their prospects most severely impaired and those working in the private sector suffering the most severe economic consequences, yet to be felt in full, while the elderly and those with underlying health issues bearing the most risk to le, which has been tragic.Many people working in the front line have worked heroically. Of course, this includes those in the health service who have had to battle to save lives, but it also includes those who kept the boilers running, the ambulances and delivery vehicles on the road and the PPE arriving where required. That includes those in supply chains up and down the country, drivers, engineers, and tradesmen keeping our homes and critical facilities operational. It also includes those who have produced our food and those who distributed it and indeed those who kept the wheels and machinery of production and distribution of le’s essentials turning. Not least in the supply chain required to put food on our plates.A great many of our population, however — which is a blessing for them, whether wealthy, retired or working in the public sector or government, local or national — have neither had their economic situation nor their future employment prospects impaired, though of course, everyone has suffered the social deprivations and mental health challenges of lockdown. For those fortunate enough to be working in secure public sector employment or retired, perhaps on a secure pension, they do not have the financial concerns of those in the private sector whose jobs and livelihoods depend on viable economic activity.This imbalance of the bearing of the economic consequences of the pandemic is not given coverage or widely recognised, though our politicians at a national and local level are actively involved in formulating policy, actions, and funding programmes to sustain the economy and build back greener, better, and more fairly.Never has it been more critical for government at all levels, locally and nationally, to do everything possible to create and support sustainable jobs across our nation.We all have an obligation to recognise and understand this fundamental fact and do what we can to support economic growth and sustain people in, as well as create new jobs. The lack of a job, and the want of it, is fundamentally one of the most damaging situations to the long-term prospects, an inidual, their family and therefore society at large can suffer from.Economic growth and development,we are to sustain ourselves as a society, must be front and centre of government policy and action at national and local level. Local authorities and local politicians have a duty and an obligation too, not only to support development but make sure that they actively seek out and promote economic development opportunities within their areas of responsibility as a minimum. There needs to be some maturity in decision making and joined-up thinking in policy and action. You simply cannot have development without some impact, but neither can you have social progression without economic development.How can we call for building back our economy and protecting jobs, yet fail to support compliant job-creating planning applications  For example, the recent decision to refuse planning for an organic sea farm in Skye, which was recommended for approval, was in my view a dereliction of responsibility. It was to create nine new jobs directly. However, just the cancelling of the equipment orders required by this development and to be built here in the Highlands by our company, Gael Force Group, has caused the redundancy of over  people immediately and directly, just in this one company alone. This is a shocking narrowness in consideration and a failure of process and joined up thinking.We have become anti-development, anti-business in this country, yet we want all the benefits that depend on a strong, successful, and growing economy. It seems that we are prepared in this country now to tolerate someone dying from hunger and homelessness and the lack of a job, but not prepared to tolerate ‘our’ view or environment being altered. In the view of some people, all other forms of nature now have precedence over their fellow human beings. Like the clearances, once again the welfare of the local people who work the land and the sea is being considered as secondary to the narrow interests of a minority, often not rooted in the area, who care not for the economic wellbeing of other local people. We need to put people, their livelihoods, and their wellbeing first.The depressing familiarity of narrow interest groups’ objections to developments, often by an outspoken, sometimes fanatical, minority, often prejudiced on misinformation fuelled on social media but not supported by the scientic facts, is reaching a crisis across the Highlands and Islands and needs to be addressed. It requires local and national political leadership to speak out and stand up for the greater good, for the peoples of the Highlands and Islands welfare and livelihoods and retake the economic development agenda that has made the rural Highlands and Islands such a turnaround success over the past  to  years.If we do not see a change of behaviour in the support of development and growing the economy by all of us, we will be a failing nation, with rural areas becoming very largely inactive economically a playground for tourists, who are very welcome but who come and who go. A place again, where the will of the few suppress the opportunity of the many. If we do not change direction, we will leave no fine place, which in rural Scotland it should be, to raise a young family as our legacy.

We#ll start it on a small scale to begin with – by supplying Birch and a few other establishments on the island, and then a couple of months down the line I’ll open it up to online sales.“I have a passion for coffee and it is so much more exciting to be part of the whole process – from sourcing, importing, and now roasting, to then serving the final product.“It creates a much better story, and it is also an ethical way of doing it as we have direct links with the farmers that we are getting the coffee from.”Assessing the season ahead, he added: “It’s a mixed bag of feelings, it is dficult to have complete faith that this is the final lockdown – I think everybody needs to err on the side of caution and respect the rules that are in place.“The added benefit of Skye is that it is rural so there is lots of space for people to socially distance. And, thankfully, with the exception of Home Farm there hasn’t been any major outbreaks – and I think that was because people were being safe and able to be outdoors.“As long as people are following the rules then that’s the best we can do.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1618924795281.jpg--covid_19___tue_20th_apr_figures.jpg?1618924795000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20210420newscovid 19 tue 20th apr figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows One further coronavirus related death and  new positive test results.

Take a picnic with you because you’ll be ready for a sandwich and a cuppa when you get back down and are looking through your phone at the many great pictures you will take. Directions from Waterfoot: Turn towards Carnlough and drive along Coast Road.You will pass the ruins of the medieval church ruins at Ardclinis .Keep your speed down and look out for a silver gate with a steep path leading off the road.  On most occasions you will see a few vehicles parked at the side of the road.Try and give yourself a good line of sight as the road is often busy with traffic - and some of the road users simply fly round the bends.There is a simple opening mechanism on the gate so you don’t have to clamber over.Leave a donation in the ‘honesty box’ at the gateside - it’s the decent thing to show your appreciation to the landowner who has allowed people to trek across his land.Follow the obvious path taking time to snap a few pics on the way. You’ll probably need a few breaks because the climb is steady. As usual, follow the country code. Keep dogs on leash at all times and collect any litter.The steep trail into the hills begins beside the ‘Game of Thrones’ houses. You will see a small gate which is the start of the climb. After that it’s entirely up to you.Be aware: There is a proper layby about half a mile further on. It is opposite a silver gate with a path leading into the hills. This is NOT the path to Galboly and is clearly marked private property.

When the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme was introduced, the ACF, like many youth organisations, embraced the concept wholeheartedly.Ronnie, who now lives at Deerfin Fold in Harryville, was one of many cadets who strove for the coveted ‘gold award’ and thanks tohis efforts he was invited to the awards ceremony in Edinburgh. But it turns out that Ronnie not only scored a gold success, he did so at the tender age of !Apparently, he was so keen to sign up for the cadets his instructor had added two years to his age so he could join, thus he may well be one of the youngest Gold winners in the history of the hugely challenging awards programme.

It was announced earlier this week that a number of appointments were available for those aged  and over, ahead of widespread availability later this month. Vaccinations are currently being offered through the regional vaccination centres, GP practices and community pharmacies.The head of Northern Ireland#s vaccination programme Patricia Donnelly, said people should attend the same location for their first and second doses of the vaccination. The only exception is for those who attended the Ulster Hospital for their first dose and are due to receive their second dose on or after April . These appointments will now all take place at the vaccination centre at the SSE Arena.Mrs Donnelly said the vaccination programme continues to make signicant progress. Pointing to the latest figures she said: This means that those age groups most vulnerable to this virus will now have some level of protection. The positive news continues when we look at the overall adult population and see that well over half of our adult population have received their first vaccine and almost , people have received both doses.“The pace at which we have been able to move through the cohorts and our ability to extend eligibility to a number of groups ahead of the original schedule is very welcome. But we must remain mindful that future progress is dependent on vaccine supply.She encouraged those eligible for a vaccination not to wait for an invitation, but to go ahead and book an appointment. The sooner you get your vaccination, the sooner you will be able to benefit, Mrs Donnelly said. Health Minister Robin Swann said vaccinations remained the key to defeating the coronavirus“This week we will see the further easing of restrictions, which is to be welcomed, but we must not forget how important it is that we all play our part in maintaining the progress we have made, Mr Swann said. “This means following all the public health advice and getting vaccinated when your time comes. Vaccination offers hope for the future and is our pathway out of this pandemic.

It has worked to date. That’s why we have moved recently to the -to- age group.We will continue to follow the JCVI advice and we will notfrom it.During the briefing, the Derry city and Strabane area, which has recorded  cases, or . cases per , of the population, over the last seven days, was singled out as an area of concern.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ddd .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_dadfc-be-d-a-ed_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ddd .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_dadfc-be-d-a-ed_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ddd .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_dadfc-be-d-a-ed_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ddd .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_dadfc-be-d-a-ed_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Health Minister Robin Swann  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueHealth Minister Robin Swann However, Mr Swann said figures suggested the spike was beginning to plateau and that the situation had not reached the stage where he would be considering a local lockdown or delaying the lting of restrictions.We are seeing a levelling off of cases, so it’s not something that is raising that red flag where we’re going ‘We have to ease back on restrictions because of the level up there’, he added.We have seen it, unfortunately, in the Derry and Strabane council area in the past. We’re not anywhere near that level where localised restrictions would need to be brought in to manage a greater threat, but it is about asking the people to use those basic steps that have worked for us in the past.Mr Swann said vaccine centres may be set up in specic areas where there is a spike in cases.Patricia Donnelly, who heads up the local vaccination programme, said a number of pilot schemes were under development which will see pop-up vaccination clinics in workplaces, sports facilities and community centres in towns such as Ballymena, Cookstown and Coleraine in the next week or two.She added officials were planning to target areas of deprivation and areas where the uptake of the flu vaccine and public health screening programmes are traditionally low.We have always saidyou can bring the vaccine closer to people, they are more likely to take itthey are even slightly hesitant, she explained.Many motivated people who go to the vaccination centres will travel distances to get their vaccine, but for those who are a little bit more doubtful, we have to provide more locally accessible .It also emerged during the briefing that it is likely the Moderna vaccine will be offered to younger cohorts as an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab.However, Ms Donnelly revealed it would not be available in Northern Ireland until June.She warned: We have very modest amounts coming, which creates a dficulty, so you can’t really depend on it, but we are likely to use it with the younger age group when it arrives.Commenting on the possibility of Covid- certicates, suggested by the First Minister last week, Mr Swann said he was not comfortable with the idea of forcing people to use them to access hospitality or close-contact services.He added he was keen that work be carried out to see how useful they would be in relation to large-scale gatherings where social distancing is not possible.He also admitted they may be needed for international travel.Northern Ireland recorded one Covid-related death and  positive cases yesterday.There were  Covid- inpatients, nine of whom were in intensive care.There is just one active Covid outbreak in local care homes.Belfast Most ReadNI driver who caused deaths of two friends and left a third in wheelchair after high-speed crash is jailedRadio Ulster’s Sarah Brett reaches Belfast at long last... and forgets where the studio isMixed feelings in Bundoran over influx of people from NIOpinion poll finds % in NI would vote to stay in UKFemale officer in Dungiven New IRA terror attack only worked  hours a monthTop VideosPlayPolice update after bomb found beside young female officers car PlayTiny Loyalist protest at Irish Secretariat building in Belfast PlayVideo: GARC thug threatens Sunday Le journalist during Ardoyne parade protestLatest CoronavirusNearly % of NI#s over s have received first Covid vaccine doseMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageCoronavirus Northern Ireland: One further death and  new cases reportedTaste of success: PM toasts jab programme as m have now received second doseLatestPregnant women should not have to attend any appointments alone – NHS guidanceDominic Raab accused of ‘sneaking out draconian cuts’ to foreign aidRyan Mason makes winning start as Spurs’ focus switches back to Premier LeagueFour killed in bomb attack at luxury Pakistan hotelNearly % of NI#s over s have received first Covid vaccine dose,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

all of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement working, and working well.“The north-south piece is absolutely essential and that means that unionists of all hues have to participate in those

“simply not the case” that her party is boycotting north-south political meetings.She said no ministers from her party had been available to attend recent sectoral meetings on transport and on languages due to timing issues, and a lack of agreement on the agendas.In February, the DUP warned that north-south relationships will be “impacted” as part of its political campaign to oppose the Northern Ireland Protocol, which governs post-Brexit trading arrangements on the Irish Sea.The party also pledged to oppose all Protocol-related measures in the Northern Ireland Assembly.TUV leader Jim Allister accused the DUP of “buckling”.“Why is a unionist facilitating a meeting to discuss trade and business development on a north-south level when our east-west links in those areas have been

Belfast Beat Newsletter Receive the big stories from across Belfast directly to your inbox  Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      Tourism is worth roughly €mto the Bundoran economy annually, welcoming hundreds of thousands of visitors every year.Sinn Fein councillor Michael McMahon, a former mayor of the town, said visitors are always welcome to the town.It#s not our intention to turn people away from Bundoran, he said.We depend very much on Northern Irish tourism because we#re in very close proximity to the border.They have been the bread and butter in Bundoran for decades. Mr McMahon said the roll-out of the vaccine will allow the town to safely welcome holidaymakers in the coming months.The vast majority of the people in the six counties are vaccinated so they are no threat.If they#re doing the right things - keeping two metres apart and keeping a safe distance - then I don#t see any harm in that.Mr McMahon said that with the absence of international travel, the town will be more dependent on visitors doing staycations again this summer.I want to see tourists coming to Bundoran and I want to see people getting back to some sort of a normality.I want to see restaurants, arcades and hotels opening, he added.Local tourists descended on the town in record numbers last summer when restrictions were lted, with many choosing Bundoran as their staycation destination, giving a massive boost to the local economy.Tourism officer for Bundoran Shane Smyth said the pandemic has caused an increase in visitors to the town.We have always had a big historic connection to Bundoran with people from the North, he said.They were the backbone of the visitor population to the town for decades and centuries.It was only last year then that we started to get more people from the southern counties that were traveling to Donegal for the first time and that was great to see, he said.Belfast Most ReadNI driver who caused deaths of two friends and left a third in wheelchair after high-speed crash is jailedRadio Ulster’s Sarah Brett reaches Belfast at long last... and forgets where the studio isMixed feelings in Bundoran over influx of people from NIOpinion poll finds % in NI would vote to stay in UKFemale officer in Dungiven New IRA terror attack only worked  hours a monthTop VideosPlayPolice update after bomb found beside young female officers car PlayTiny Loyalist protest at Irish Secretariat building in Belfast PlayNI Assembly debate motion to ban gay conversion therapyLatest Northern IrelandNearly % of NI#s over s have received first Covid vaccine doseMagherafelt man charged with drink driving after recording highest ever alcohol reading in Northern IrelandPop-up vaccination centres to target NI#s Covid- hotspotsNI Secretary Lewis accuses SDLP reps of #incendiary# Twitter comments around disorder Vaccine passports in Northern Ireland should be limited to large events – SwannLatestPregnant women should not have to attend any appointments alone – NHS guidanceDominic Raab accused of ‘sneaking out draconian cuts’ to foreign aidRyan Mason makes winning start as Spurs’ focus switches back to Premier LeagueFour killed in bomb attack at luxury Pakistan hotelNearly % of NI#s over s have received first Covid vaccine dose,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNI Secretary Brandon Lewis and SDLP leader Colum Eastwood clashed in the Commons.Gareth CrossTwitterEmailApril   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has been urged to clary his remarks after accusing SDLP representatives of making incendiary comments on social media after recent violence.The Secretary of State made the statement during an exchange with SDLP leader Colum Eastwood in the House of Commons on Wednesday. During Northern Ireland questions Mr Eastwood condemned the attempt on the le of a serving police officer in Dungiven. He also accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of being more interested in intervening over the recent European Super League than disorder on the streets of Northern Ireland. There were outbreaks of violence across the region following the decision by the Public Prosecution Service not to prosecute Sinn Fein representatives for their attendance at the funeral of IRA man Bobby Storey during the coronavirus pandemic.The disorder has also been blamed on anger within the unionist community over the post-Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol which prevents a hard border in the island of Ireland by creating and trade border in the Irish Sea, leaving the region aligned with the EU on trade rules. Loyalists claim Northern Ireland has been effectively cut off from the rest of the UK.  Belfast Beat Newsletter Receive the big stories from across Belfast directly to your inbox  Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      Mr Eastwood accused the Prime Minister of being unengaged and uninterested in Northern Ireland.“Given the Prime Minister’s very speedy response to an issue about football, as important as that is, compared to his response and the quickness of his response, in terms of violence on the streets of Northern Ireland for almost  days, does the Secretary of State agree with me, that we need an active and engaged and interested Prime Minister in terms of dealing with our peace process , the Foyle MP asked in the Commons. Mr Lewis said he was very proud of the fact we have a Prime Minister who is very much enagaged. He should also look at the Prime Minister#s comments and the fact that he was talking to the Taoiseach in the early stages, the NI Secretary said. Mr Lewis said he absolutely agreed with Mr Eastwood regarding the attack on the police officer#s home. The Prime Minister has been actively involved and has been in full communication all the way through this process, and in terms of looking at how people deal with this I would just say that all members of this house, including some of his own party, need to think very carefully when they are tweeting things that actually could be seen as incendiary, to make sure we all take the right tone with these matters, to ensure that wecalm for people as quickly as possible.Speaking later on Wednesday Mr Eastwood questioned the Secretary of State#s remarks. He should know by now that words in this chamber have an implication on the streets, the Foyle MP said. “We’ve seen it too many times.

ReutersChristopher LeebodyTwitterEmailApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Prime Minister has told the House of Commons there is “more to be done” for veterans of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, following the resignation of defence minister Johnny Mercer.The Prime Minister was responding to DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who called on Mr Johnson to “stand by” his commitment to introduce legislation protecting veterans of the Troubles from “vexatious prosecutions”.Read MoreJohnny Mercer claims he had ‘no choice’ but to quit as veterans ministerDowning Street confirmed on Tuesday evening that the Prime Minister had accepted Mr Mercer’s resignation as veterans minister following speculation he intended to quit the post.MP Johnny Mercer had been heavily involved in the Overseas Operations Bill, which is going through its final stages in Parliament.The legislation was developed in response to legal claims made after operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, but it does not cover incidents in Northern Ireland.

However, she added that those who had “stepped outside” the law while operating in the army should be “held to account”.Northern Ireland’s veterans’ commissioner Danny Kinahan suggested on Wednesday that such a limit on any prosecutions should apply to civilians alongside soldiers.I don’t want to see any veterans going to court that don’t have to...there are cases that must go [to court] from all sides, he told BBC Radio Ulster’s Good Morning Ulster.I don#t support anything that stops someone who should be going to court going to court but we do need to put some limit here.I think it has to be for everyone... what we need is for everyone to engage and actually help find the solution.“We have cases here bubbling from people who served ,  sometimes close to -years-ago – we are not likely to get any prosecutions from it.”Disagreeing with the former Ulster Unionist MP on whether a time limit on prosecutions should apply to “everyone”, Arlene Foster said the “hope of justice can’t be taken away” from victims.“There is always an attempt to bring some equivalence between people who put on the armour of protecting their citizens and those people who go out to murder and maim,” she added.“There is no equivalence between terrorists who go out to murder and maim and those veterans and people who go out to serve their country and protect.”Belfast Most ReadNI driver who caused deaths of two friends and left a third in wheelchair after high-speed crash is jailedRadio Ulster’s Sarah Brett reaches Belfast at long last... and forgets where the studio isMixed feelings in Bundoran over influx of people from NIOpinion poll finds % in NI would vote to stay in UKFemale officer in Dungiven New IRA terror attack only worked  hours a monthTop VideosPlayPolice update after bomb found beside young female officers car PlayTiny Loyalist protest at Irish Secretariat building in Belfast PlayVideo: GARC thug threatens Sunday Le journalist during Ardoyne parade protestLatest Northern IrelandNearly % of NI#s over s have received first Covid vaccine doseMagherafelt man charged with drink driving after recording highest ever alcohol reading in Northern IrelandPop-up vaccination centres to target NI#s Covid- hotspotsNI Secretary Lewis accuses SDLP reps of #incendiary# Twitter comments around disorder Vaccine passports in Northern Ireland should be limited to large events – SwannLatestPregnant women should not have to attend any appointments alone – NHS guidanceDominic Raab accused of ‘sneaking out draconian cuts’ to foreign aidRyan Mason makes winning start as Spurs’ focus switches back to Premier LeagueFour killed in bomb attack at luxury Pakistan hotelNearly % of NI#s over s have received first Covid vaccine dose,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

After all of this time... to finally get to be together, it was special.“Around the time of the interviews, we talked about how much we were looking forward to working together... and then we ended up spending a year not seeing each other apart from on Zoom.”Not that close proximity always means perfection.“Hilariously, we almost didn’t know who was going to pick up right at the start of this morning’s programme at .am,” Sarah revealed.“But it’s much easier now because you can read someone physically when you’re next to them.“Within two or three weeks, Chris and I will know by the way the other person sits in a chair whether or not they want to get in, whether or not they want to make a cup of tea...“We’ve already learned each other’s way of broadcasting incredibly well – maybe even better - because it’s like we’ve developed an extra sense to a certain extent through not being together.”During the show, her co-presenter exposed Sarah’s early morning Jaffa Cake fix and she told me the treat “does not y, because not all biscuits are created equal at the breakfast time of day”.“If I’m broadcasting, then the Jaffa Cakes are my breakfast because I won’t have eaten at am,” she said, adding that she’s in bed by pm on work nights.Currently Sarah’s commute is “ miles door to door, which takes about one hour  minutes” although once the roadworks are complete she’ll be able to shave some time off that.“I’ve got a six-year-old and an -year-old mother, who’s living with me, and a husband I’m leaving... let’s see how this new arrangement goes,” she said.Co-presenter Chris meanwhile, was shocked when Sarah suddenly exited the studio during one of Tuesday morning’s news bulletins.“I think he thought I was leaving him at am when I got up and left, but I was actually just going to make us a cup of tea,” she said.“During the programme I need to walk and clear my head because otherwise you’re sitting there for two and a half hours.“Chris, on the other hand, was sitting drinking the same cup of tea for two and a half hours, which is utterly outrageous.”Belfast Most ReadNI driver who caused deaths of two friends and left a third in wheelchair after high-speed crash is jailedRadio Ulster’s Sarah Brett reaches Belfast at long last... and forgets where the studio isMixed feelings in Bundoran over influx of people from NIOpinion poll finds % in NI would vote to stay in UKFemale officer in Dungiven New IRA terror attack only worked  hours a monthTop VideosPlayPolice update after bomb found beside young female officers car PlayTiny Loyalist protest at Irish Secretariat building in Belfast PlayNI Assembly debate motion to ban gay conversion therapyLatest Northern IrelandNearly % of NI#s over s have received first Covid vaccine doseMagherafelt man charged with drink driving after recording highest ever alcohol reading in Northern IrelandPop-up vaccination centres to target NI#s Covid- hotspotsNI Secretary Lewis accuses SDLP reps of #incendiary# Twitter comments around disorder Vaccine passports in Northern Ireland should be limited to large events – SwannLatestPregnant women should not have to attend any appointments alone – NHS guidanceDominic Raab accused of ‘sneaking out draconian cuts’ to foreign aidRyan Mason makes winning start as Spurs’ focus switches back to Premier LeagueFour killed in bomb attack at luxury Pakistan hotelNearly % of NI#s over s have received first Covid vaccine dose,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A total of £,,, will be on its way to school leaders. It makes a good headline as a -figure sum written down on paper. But when dissected between schools, then between inidual pupils, the figures show nursery and primary schools are left with £,. to spend on each pupil, with £,. per pupil in post-primaries. It is £ more per child than in  .The largest slice of the financial cake naturally goes to the largest schools. Methodist College in Belfast, with more than , pupils, tops the list with £.m. Belfast Beat Newsletter Receive the big stories from across Belfast directly to your inbox  Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      St Ronan#s College in Lurgan, with over , pupils, receives £.m. Also getting £m-plus are Bangor Academy and Sixth Form College, and St Paul#s High in Bessbrook.At the other end of the scale, rural primaries like Duneane PS in Toomebridge must make do with £,.What it adds up to is not enough cake to go around - a situation school leaders have become all too used to.Yes, this can be dressed up as a small uplt in funding, said Dr Graham Gault, president of the National Head Teachers# Association.That can be welcomed, but it is many millions of pounds short of what is needed.Huge though the sum may seem, this is not the all-singing, all-dancing budget to allow schools to perform to the best of their ability.Dr Gault says there are three simple but key dimensions in assessing the available funding.Firstly, a decade of withdrawing hundreds of millions of pounds from front line education has created huge deficit positions for many schools, which just get larger with each financial year, he added.Secondly, aside from cumulative deficits from which most schools can never escape, the annual budgets allocated to schools are, in most cases, not enough to meet the basic spending needs of keeping a school open.And thirdly, of schools# current spending, between % and % is allocated to basic staffing provision alone.It doesn#t take much working out to imagine what is left for the resourcing of children#s learning and development after the essential costs are met like heat, electricity... the list goes.What it means is that a sticking plaster has once again been administered to a system in need of major surgery.The truth is, of course, our children and young people have endured greater cuts than in any other jurisdiction on these islands, said Dr Gault. Sticking plaster attempts to help will not be sufficient for the depth, seriousness and potentially long-term signicance of these wounds.We need urgent, serious action in the form of money to our front line education services.Where, though, is that money going to come from On top of all that, analysis released by the Education Policy Instituteshows some £-£bn is required across the UK to make up for learning lost during the pandemic.Some £m is needed in Northern Ireland alone, and while teachers will recoil at the terminology, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said establishing a long-term plan for catch-up was the biggest priority.EPI research shows without ambitious funding and interventions, which tackle the scale of lost education, there are likely to be severe long-run consequences for young people#s schooling, earnings and le chances, which would in turn cause damage to the economy.There may be a little hope on the horizon, with a full independent review of the education system due this year. The process for compiling the  is under way, but whoever sits on it won#t have to look far to see the needless millions being spent on an antiquated system no longer fit for purpose. The administrative costs of maintaining such a erse system continues to eat education from within.Courage is needed to make the dficult choices and begin peeling the layers away one by one. Like an onion, with every layer peeled, some will cry. Tears, though, shed for the greater good of children. Tears can be wiped away and eyes can be dried, but there is only one chance at giving a child the right education.Assessing the maths homework, extra revision is required or parents will again be footing the bill for toilet rolls.Belfast Most ReadNI driver who caused deaths of two friends and left a third in wheelchair after high-speed crash is jailedRadio Ulster’s Sarah Brett reaches Belfast at long last... and forgets where the studio isMixed feelings in Bundoran over influx of people from NIOpinion poll finds % in NI would vote to stay in UKFemale officer in Dungiven New IRA terror attack only worked  hours a monthTop VideosPlayPolice update after bomb found beside young female officers car PlayTiny Loyalist protest at Irish Secretariat building in Belfast PlayVideo: GARC thug threatens Sunday Le journalist during Ardoyne parade protestLatest Northern IrelandNearly % of NI#s over s have received first Covid vaccine doseMagherafelt man charged with drink driving after recording highest ever alcohol reading in Northern IrelandPop-up vaccination centres to target NI#s Covid- hotspotsNI Secretary Lewis accuses SDLP reps of #incendiary# Twitter comments around disorder Vaccine passports in Northern Ireland should be limited to large events – SwannLatestPregnant women should not have to attend any appointments alone – NHS guidanceDominic Raab accused of ‘sneaking out draconian cuts’ to foreign aidRyan Mason makes winning start as Spurs’ focus switches back to Premier LeagueFour killed in bomb attack at luxury Pakistan hotelNearly % of NI#s over s have received first Covid vaccine dose,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The club had been invigorated at the turn of the Millennium and in the - season they had narrowly missed out on the league title. Hearts and minds were already looking to future progress on the field, but a sudden council decision was to plunge the club into uncertainty, inadvertently removing that field. “In late s and early s all first team games were played at Meadowbank as it suited intermediate football rules,” said former first team coach Robert Rainey. “The Magherafelt council CEO John McLaughlin called a meeting with chairman Glenn Robinson, secretary Brian Rocks and myself to explain the new creation of Meadowbank sports arena. googletag.cmd.push “The team, having examined the council plan, observed that it did not comply with intermediate football rules.” The clubs original mini-soccer center back in . The decision left the club in an awkward spot. Strict conditions had to be met for the Sky Blues to continue to compete at intermediate level and they were about to be rendered homeless. There were limited options within the council area for leasing pitches that would meet the leagues rules, but a solution was found less than a mile from Meadowbank. “At the monthly Sky Blues meeting it was agreed to ask the council to rent out a pitch in Magherafelt known as Stoney Park,” said Robert Rainey. googletag.cmd.push “This pitch was a nightmare to the council as it was open ground and very hard to maintain, so the council agreed to this request from us and a lease was agreed.” An agreed -year lease on the land marked the first step on a challenging journey to creating a facility fit for a club with ever-growing ambitions. The playing surface at Stoney Park lived up to its name and was hard and unforgiving. The clubs plans included the resanding and drainage of the entire area. Work at Spires Park in  ahead of the clubs new committee room and kitchen.     The development would also include an exterior and interior fence, a new two-team changing facility, showers and a separate referees changing room. Consultation with local residents proved just one of a number of hurdles the club had to navigate in getting their plans through. They enlisted local MLA Patsy McGlone to help with their application, and at a make-or-break planning meeting in Ballymena, their plans were approved. With the area acquired by the club known as Stoney Park, the club felt a rebranding was in order and officials convened in a snooker room connected to Anthony Campbells house in Magherafelt. Amid lively discussion, Martin Kerr proposed the facilitys name be changed to Spires Park, a reference to the distinctive spires of the towns three main churches. Linfield played at official opening of Spires back in  pictured was club captain Gareth Cassidy. The committee concurred, and Kerrs canny name change banished many club members memories of the dficult playing surface in one fell swoop. By the summer of , the fencing, painting and decorating had all been completed, in time to allow the Sky Blues to commence the   season in their shiny new home. The changing rooms and referees facility were next on the to-do list, and as the club continued to grow, further upgrades were required. “We knew Magherafelt and the South Derry area was a hot bed of footballing talent,” said former Chairperson Glenn Robinson. “All we had to do was put the hard work into securing Spires, and we knew the club would thrive. The decision by the council had forced the committee to think big picture and long term. “To our delight, we leased Spires Park, redeveloped it, and during the worst recession in living memory, secured and repaid the finance required to do it.” The development of he facilities took a further step under the leadership of Chairperson Brian Surgenor. Office cabins, a small kitchen, disabled access toilet and large meeting space were among the progress, as well as a new storage shed and ball stops at the leisure centre end. With a top class facility in place, the clubs volunteers put their shoulders to the while in maintaining the Sky Blues focal point in the area. BBC came to town last year to interview all the local clubs in relation to Covid-, Thomas Niblock is pictured with Club Chairman Gerry Kelly. Glenn Robinson highlighted the importance of Spires Park in securing the clubs status as an important piece of County Derrys footballing tapestry. “The decision to move to Spires has catapulted Sky Blues as an important football brand and club not only in South Derry but also Northern Ireland,” he said. “Since  thousands of young and old players have used the facility and everyone from the original committee back then to the current one should be congratulated for the work they have put into this. “Football is the beautul game and Spires Park has given so many players in this area a chance to enjoy the game we all love. “Everyone linked with this club should be proud of what they are doing to provide these opportunities.” Last week, the thud of colliding leather echoed around Spires Park as collective training resumed. The excited cries of young and not-so-young players. Yelps of celebration. The sounds of football are back and through years of hard work, the Sky Blues have built an arena fit to welcome them.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The club had been invigorated at the turn of the Millennium and in the - season they had narrowly missed out on the league title. Hearts and minds were already looking to future progress on the field, but a sudden council decision was to plunge the club into uncertainty, inadvertently removing that field. “In late s and early s all first team games were played at Meadowbank as it suited intermediate football rules,” said former first team coach Robert Rainey. “The Magherafelt council CEO John McLaughlin called a meeting with chairman Glenn Robinson, secretary Brian Rocks and myself to explain the new creation of Meadowbank sports arena. googletag.cmd.push “The team, having examined the council plan, observed that it did not comply with intermediate football rules.” The clubs original mini-soccer center back in . The decision left the club in an awkward spot. Strict conditions had to be met for the Sky Blues to continue to compete at intermediate level and they were about to be rendered homeless. There were limited options within the council area for leasing pitches that would meet the leagues rules, but a solution was found less than a mile from Meadowbank. “At the monthly Sky Blues meeting it was agreed to ask the council to rent out a pitch in Magherafelt known as Stoney Park,” said Robert Rainey. googletag.cmd.push “This pitch was a nightmare to the council as it was open ground and very hard to maintain, so the council agreed to this request from us and a lease was agreed.” An agreed -year lease on the land marked the first step on a challenging journey to creating a facility fit for a club with ever-growing ambitions. The playing surface at Stoney Park lived up to its name and was hard and unforgiving. The clubs plans included the resanding and drainage of the entire area. Work at Spires Park in  ahead of the clubs new committee room and kitchen.     The development would also include an exterior and interior fence, a new two-team changing facility, showers and a separate referees changing room. Consultation with local residents proved just one of a number of hurdles the club had to navigate in getting their plans through. They enlisted local MLA Patsy McGlone to help with their application, and at a make-or-break planning meeting in Ballymena, their plans were approved. With the area acquired by the club known as Stoney Park, the club felt a rebranding was in order and officials convened in a snooker room connected to Anthony Campbells house in Magherafelt. Amid lively discussion, Martin Kerr proposed the facilitys name be changed to Spires Park, a reference to the distinctive spires of the towns three main churches. Linfield played at official opening of Spires back in  pictured was club captain Gareth Cassidy. The committee concurred, and Kerrs canny name change banished many club members memories of the dficult playing surface in one fell swoop. By the summer of , the fencing, painting and decorating had all been completed, in time to allow the Sky Blues to commence the   season in their shiny new home. The changing rooms and referees facility were next on the to-do list, and as the club continued to grow, further upgrades were required. “We knew Magherafelt and the South Derry area was a hot bed of footballing talent,” said former Chairperson Glenn Robinson. “All we had to do was put the hard work into securing Spires, and we knew the club would thrive. The decision by the council had forced the committee to think big picture and long term. “To our delight, we leased Spires Park, redeveloped it, and during the worst recession in living memory, secured and repaid the finance required to do it.” The development of he facilities took a further step under the leadership of Chairperson Brian Surgenor. Office cabins, a small kitchen, disabled access toilet and large meeting space were among the progress, as well as a new storage shed and ball stops at the leisure centre end. With a top class facility in place, the clubs volunteers put their shoulders to the while in maintaining the Sky Blues focal point in the area. BBC came to town last year to interview all the local clubs in relation to Covid-, Thomas Niblock is pictured with Club Chairman Gerry Kelly. Glenn Robinson highlighted the importance of Spires Park in securing the clubs status as an important piece of County Derrys footballing tapestry. “The decision to move to Spires has catapulted Sky Blues as an important football brand and club not only in South Derry but also Northern Ireland,” he said. “Since  thousands of young and old players have used the facility and everyone from the original committee back then to the current one should be congratulated for the work they have put into this. “Football is the beautul game and Spires Park has given so many players in this area a chance to enjoy the game we all love. “Everyone linked with this club should be proud of what they are doing to provide these opportunities.” Last week, the thud of colliding leather echoed around Spires Park as collective training resumed. The excited cries of young and not-so-young players. Yelps of celebration. The sounds of football are back and through years of hard work, the Sky Blues have built an arena fit to welcome them.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The -year-old has become Derry City’s number one goalkeeper this season but has come in for some criticism in the first few weeks of the season. However, Gartside was in superb form last night, producing two vital stops in particular to help his team win a point against the Lilywhites. Gartside denied Sam Stanton when he was one on one with the goalkeeper, and he saved the best for last when he somehow kept out a fierce drive from David McMillan with just two minutes remaining. His manager praised him and his team mates after an enthralling game at the Brandywell. googletag.cmd.push “I’m delighted for Nathan Gartside,” Devine said. “I’m really, really happy for Nathan because rightly or wrongly he has taken a wee bit of criticism, and his second save down his right side was just outstanding. I’m delighted for David Parkhouse who looked back to himself in terms of hard work and bullying centre backs. Then there is Ronan Boyce, and what can you say about Ronan Boyce, he just keeps getting better and better and better. “The documentary also meant a lot to wee Jackie and I thought he showed tremendous character having been left out in the last game or two, to come in and be really, really aggressive in the middle of the park. googletag.cmd.push “Dundalk have players who have been the best in a generation in League of Ireland football. They have players there who played in the Europa League last year, they have full internationals playing, and they have players who have league titles and FAI Cups under their belts. We finished the game with just two players over  years of age. We played I think  or  local based players, so we’re delighted having gone a goal behind that the response from the players was very aggressive and we had the determination to get something from the game.”        --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The upgrade of the Buncrana Road was first mooted some  years ago. Hopes that work would commence in the near future rose this week after it emerged that traffic lights are to be erected at the Springtown Road junction of Buncrana Road. However, Dfi has quashed those hopes by stating the new lights were being put in place to facilitate an expectant increase in traffic due to the construction of a new Lidl supermarket due to open in  weeks time. googletag.cmd.push In a statement to the Derry News, a Dfi spokesperson said: “Planning permission was granted for a new Lidl store on the Buncrana Road which includes for the upgrade of the Springtown Road Buncrana Road junction to a signal controlled junction prior to the opening of the new store. “This measure is to assist the mitigation of the impact of traffic generated by the new retail outlet in the interests of road safety and traffic progression and will incorporate a pedestrian phase.” The spokesperson added: “In June , Minster Mallon announced her commitment to fund the continued development of a number of Strategic Road Improvement schemes including the A Buncrana Road, as part of her plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation while addressing regional imbalance. googletag.cmd.push “Consistent with wider priorities, Minister Mallon is committed to ensuring that this scheme is future-proofed to help stimulate green recovery. “The Department is continuing to progress the A Buncrana Road scheme in line with the objectives which include improving transport links, road safety, traffic progression and contributing to the regeneration of the area. The spokesperson concluded: “Officials will continue discussions with all affected landowners and other stakeholders over the coming months and to progress scheme development.” Sinn Fein Foyle MLA Martina Anderson said it was vitally important the upgrade took place as soon as possible. “The full upgrade of this road is crucial to ensure that it is fit for purpose as a main gateway into our Donegal hinterland and feature in any future expansion of the Fort George site.     “And it is also vitally important to make sure that happens as soon as possible for all the residents and businesses along its entirety as it’s estimated that over , vehicles use itdaily.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Health Minister Robin Swann said those eligible should seize the opportunity. “Getting the vaccine not only protects you but also those close to you,” he said.  “I would also strongly encourage anyone aged  years or over who hasn’t booked themselves a vaccination appointment yet to do so as soon as possible. “I have always been clear that we would move through the vaccine programme as quickly as vaccine deliveries and capacity allows as recommended by JCVI .” “Opening up to - year olds earlier than expected is a testament to the hard work and dedication of all staff who are delivering the vaccination programme in Northern Ireland.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The work will be carried out from Monday, April , until Sunday, May . Derry SDLP councillor John Boyle welcomed the improvements to the roads in the cemetery. “I raised concerns about the condition of some of the roads within the city cemetery a while back, he said. Quite a number of constituents had contacted me about the matter and were worried that their vehicles might be damaged by potholes. I inspected the area to confirm the level of the problem and I am pleased that it has now been confirmed that the situation is now being addressed.” googletag.cmd.push Cllr Boyle said that regular visitors to the City Cemetery are advised that access to the site will be restricted for a number of days to allow for essential maintenance work to be carried out on the road system. This work will be carried out at the cemetery from Monday April th until Sunday May nd, necessitating a temporary road closure from April th and limited access to the site. I would ask visitors to adhere to the traffic signalling and instruction from contractors. Visitors to the main cemetery area are asked to enter and exit the cemetery through the Creggan gate only. Any visitors to the lower new area of the cemetery should enter and exit via the Lone Moor Road gate. googletag.cmd.push Streetscape and Cemeteries Manager with Derry City and Strabane District Council, John Quinn, said: These are much needed maintenance works and its hoped that they wont cause too much disruption at the site and we will try to accommodate visitors as best we can for the duration of the work.

Visitors are asked to arrive gym or swim ready at centres – swimmers wearing costumes beneath their clothes – as changing will take place poolside with designated areas on the pool deck to store clothing.

Police have branded the attack sickening and a host of local politicians have condemned the incident. Today we are investigating a sickening attack on a young mother who serves her community both as a member of police staff and as a part time police officer, saidAssistant Chief Constable Mark McEwan, Head of PSNI Crime Operations Branch. The investigation is still at an early stage but a strong line of enquiry is this is the reason she was targeted by violent terrorists. googletag.cmd.push Yesterday morning our colleague discovered a suspicious object beside her car in close proximity to her house in Ballyquin Road, Dungiven. We assess this was a viable device with explosives attached to a container with flammable liquid. This was designed to cause a fireball which would have engulfed the victim’s car and anyone in it or anyone close by, or those calling to the house… What is really distressing is the terrorists placed the bomb at the rear of the car directly at the point where the victim’s  year daughter sits. This demonstrates the complete and utter disregard for the le of a mother and her toddler, which simply beggars belief. googletag.cmd.push While the investigation is at an early stage and detectives are keeping an open mind, a strong line of enquiry is that this attack is the work of the New IRA. Also, it is worth reflecting that the attack took place while the rest of the country were pausing to remember, nearly  years ago to the day, that this group of wicked iniduals murdered a young woman – Lyra McKee – in Creggan. It is clear they are still intent on recklessly targeting honest, hard-working members of our community with no concern at all for who they harm or kill in the process.     I appeal to anyone who has any knowledge of this attack, or indeed of anyone involved in dissident republican, or other violent or terrorist, activity to come forward and provide any information they have to the police. We particularly want to hear from anyone who was in the area of Ballyquin Road, Dungiven during the evening of Sundayth into the morning of Monday th. If you do have any information you need to come forward. It is time for people to examine their own consciences and ask themselves whether they support attempting to kill a  year old child and her mother. Please call Terrorism Investigation Unit detectives on  quoting reference number    , or submit a report online using our non-emergency reporting form viahttp:www.psni.police.uk makeareport . You can also contact Crimestoppers anonymously on    or online athttp:crimestoppers-uk.org . The Ballyquin Road has now re-opened.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Once completed, these new facilities will provide much needed education benefits for pupils, staff, teachers, parents and for the wider community.” The Limavady Shared Education Campus Project was selected as part of the first call to the Shared Education Campus Programme in  and announced as a project to receive funding from the Fresh Start Programme in March . East Derry MLA Claire Sugden said the partnership should provide a template for other schools to work collaboratively. Visiting both schools, it was great to see kids not fussed and getting on with it – because sharing space is normal, no big deal and as it should be, she said. googletag.cmd.push For too long our children have been separated throughout their education – not because they wanted to be but because of the system and culture in Northern Ireland. Schools will need further support in and investment this respect, and I am delighted that this investment has been made by the Executive. “It bodes well for the future – both for our schools and for wider society here.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Responding to an Assembly Question from Mid Ulster MLA Patsy McGlone, Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural AffairsMinister Edwin Poots said officials were seeking approval from the Department of Finance. I fully recognise the pressures faced by the Lough Neagh fishing industry as a result of the Covid- pandemic, he said. I have had to consider closely complexities relating to the eligibility criteria for a scheme while balancing the need for an inclusive approach. I have now directed my officials on how I wish to proceed with a support scheme to alleviate the financial impacts of the pandemic on commercial fishermen licensed to fish on Lough Neagh. googletag.cmd.push My officials are liaising with the Department of Finance to seek approval to proceed with the scheme. Patsy McGlone MLA has welcomed the progress, but said there is no justication for its delay. It is not clear what changes the Minister has made to the scheme since the Assembly Committee was told previously that it had been cleared by the Departmental Solicitors Office and by the Department of Finance, he said. I have raised this issue with the AERA Minister and departmental officials repeatedly in the Assembly and Committee over a number of months.  There is no justication for theof time it has taken to finalise the scheme. People were promised that this support would be provided last summer. googletag.cmd.push “Many of those fishing families are on relatively low incomes, and they need that support. “It is now up to the Finance Minister to respond promptly and authorise the revised scheme, so that the financial support that has been promised to this sector can finally be delivered.” Mid Ulster councillor Niall McAleer has also welcomed the progress made on the scheme. It is welcome news that a financial support scheme has been confirmed today that will finally see some much needed cash being put into the pockets of local fishermen, he said. Despite the fact that the DAERA Minister Edwin Poots has repeatedly said, as far back as last August, that support would be put in place soon, it has taken over a year since the start of the COVID- pandemic to put this scheme in place, which is unacceptable.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After  years in Asia,  of which have been in Thailand, John is now nearing  years of age and is finally taking a step back from an adulthood that has revolved wholeheartedly around the growth of gaelic football in Bangkok and beyond. The magnitude of the Asian GAA community cannot be underestimated. The Asian Games are massive in this part of the world, with over  teams involved – men and women, and over  people coming together in friendship and competition. There are  clubs in Asia and the popularity of the sport, amongst Irish exiles and locals is growing year on year. googletag.cmd.push At the heart of this growth was, and is, Derry native John who founded Thailand GAA in . Since then, John has slowly but surely built something lasting, ever since agreeing to a request from the Asian County Board to set up a gaelic football team in Thailand. That set in motion a chain of events that has resulted in a thriving club – Thai GAA – but also a gaelic community that extends far beyond the limitations of the game itself. With three South Asia Championships to their name, Thai GAA is not just there to make up the numbers – it has ambition, not just for growth, but for success, and winning the men’s section of the Asian Gaelic Games remains the ultimate goal. googletag.cmd.push It is a far cry from kicking a ball about with Oxford United back in the late s. “I would never have thought  years ago when I was in Derry that I would end up in Thailand,” John admits. “I had one of those fork in the road moments. I was working for two years in England and was itching to get back home. I wasn’t that satisfied with my career and wanted to do something dferent. It was in July ’ that my boss rang me and asked ‘How do you fancy going to Thailand next week ’. The very same day I got a job offer back in Derry. I thoughtThailand didn’t happen, I would take the job in Derry. A week later I was in Thailand. That taste in travel, it opens your eyes to the world and I have never looked back.”     John left St. Columb’s in  and was accepted into Loughborough University for a degree in Chemical Engineering. Loughborough’s fine sporting pedigree was a key factor behind his choice but that side of it didn’t work out as he hoped and it wasn’t until his final year that he kicked a ball regularly again. He started playing gaelic – not his strong suit – in Leicester, before moving to Reading where there was a strong Irish community, and plenty in the way of soccer and gaelic. His job took him all around the world, but a trip to Taiwan in  ultimately changed his path and his le, completely. Now married to Jessie, with children Shannen, Cara and Caolan, John remembers when he discovered just how popular gaelic was in Asia. “I went to Taiwan in  on a project and discovered gaelic football team there,” he recalls. “They were competing in Asian Gaelic Games. It was just amazing to see  Irish people playing Gaelic football in China. “I had the opportunity to meet with Micheal OMuircheartaigh who was the honorary President of the Asian County Board. He comes over year and commentates on the games pitch-side. I didn’t watch a lot of gaelic growing up but I always watched the All-Ireland final. His voice was legendary and to actually meet the guy and have dinner with him and get to know him, was inspiring. “I ed to Thailand in , the County Board asked Johnhe could set up a team in Thailand. I managed to get a few Irish people and a few non-Irish people together and we got a team together and we played in our first Asian Games in Singapore in . In our first match we were lined up against Singapore Rugby team and I was in midfield and was lined up against a guy called Phil Green, who used to be a hooker for the England rugby team. “That was our first participation as Thailand GAA. Since then, every year, except , we have entered a team into the Asian Gaelic Games.”  Responsibility For a man who preferred soccer, and even a bit of golf, John was suddenly thrust into a position of responsibility, and, admittedly stubborn, he was not about to give his new role anything other than %. It was not easy however, and a lot of dficult days passed for a club which started out with five showing up for training to a club and city which has now hosted the Asian Games on three occasions, in ,  and  as well as hosting the South Asia Games on four occasions. “It was very dficult to be honest,” he admits. “The first thing I did was put an ad in the Bangkok Post and I got maybe four or five replies. The first training session had four or five people with a few girlfriends watching on. Because of my background with Oxford United, fitness came first so I told the guys they wouldn’t see a ball until they were fit, and I think because they had a dferent background from me, they thought this wasn’t for them. I probably scared people away. “Near tournaments it’s easy to get people to commit, but during the year and you’re running training once a week – I have a -hour commute to get out to training – you’re not sure what numbers you’re going to get. It’s very frustrating and the number of times I questioned myself ‘Why am I doing this ’ It was dficult, but I’m quite stubborn as well, and when I start something, it takes a lot for me to drop it because I want to make it a success. I persevered and I persevered and in  it really started changing.” The foundations of Thai GAA really started to take hold thanks to a talented group of girls, who came to the club, not just wanting to play, but to compete at the highest level. As defining moments go, this was signicant for John and his hopes of what Thai GAA could ultimately be. “I got a batch of girls in who were all natural athletes,” he explains. “Only two of them were Irish, one from the North and one from the South and neither of them had played gaelic before. One of them had played soccer for Northern Ireland but had no background in gaelic football. I had this group of girls for six weeks – all teachers from international schools before the  Asian Games in Malaysia, trying to get the basics. “In the first games they were asking ‘Where do I stand  Where do I go ’ They won six out of six at that tournament and won their ision. That was unbelievable success. Their hardest game was actually the semi-final against the Japanese Ladies. We beat them on Sudden Death Golden Goal. The same bunch of girls came back the next year in  and they won their title again that year. The following year they lost in the Upper Division, but that set the basis. This group of girls was committed, they loved their sport and we were giving them an opening to play competitively. “ was when we really bedded in as a club and that was on the back of our girls’ team. In , my girls won the South Asia Championship, so that was a regional tournament involving Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan and Shanghai. That was quite an achievement.”  Sustained success On the back of the girls’ success, the club got this influx of Irish men in  and that has since helped sustain the club over the last  years. The first men’s trophy soon followed – the Plate at the South Asia Games, and from there the club has gone from strength to strength. Better quality players joined – some with county experience, and fresh ideas and new energy began running through Thai GAA. “I was trying to remember things I learned playing with Doire Colmcille  or  years ago, but then these guys come in with fresh ideas and I was happy to let them coach,” John laughs. “The club is in a really strong place right now. We probably have about  members. What’s important is that there is a really good social side to the club as well. Most of the players would be late ’s, and early to late s, but there is room for everyone and it’s just a home away from home for a lot of people. It’s a good social network as well and you’re giving people a chance to play competitive sport as well as keeping fit. “Something I’ve picked up from the last  years of playing gaelic in Asia is what gaelic football means to people as a community. Most major cities in Asia have a gaelic team and it really is a home away from home from Irish and Northern Irish people, and people from both sides of the community in Ireland.” Only recently, John gave up the Chairmanship at the club, as he finally takes a back step from the day to day running of Thai GAA. It has been a labour of passion for the Carnhill man for  years, and he is proud of what it has become. He is not about to drt away into the sunset however. He might be turning  but he wants to keep playing, and doing whatever he can to ensure longevity and success for the club in the future. “I am very proud of what we’ve achieved in Thailand,” he says. “It’s also helped me stay connected to Ireland to be honest. This connection with gaelic football has given me more of an identity and a connection with Ireland being overseas. I have been able to meet a lot of people through gaelic football. The GAA certainly connects people and you can see the impact it has overseas. “I’m realizing that Father Time is marching on. I still want to be involved with the club, but I have work and family commitments. I used to be very heavily involved in making all the decisions but I have got a good bunch of people in there now who can share the load. “The next tournament maybe in Bangkok next year as it will host the South Asia Games and then at the end of  for the Asia Games, so maybe I can have a final swansong at those. There are guys older than me still playing so there’s a level for everyone. I’ll still be involved.”  Home away from home John s to Derry every summer with his family but for now, and for the past  years, his real home has been over , miles away, where he has helped build not just a team, but a club, a community and a legacy that will last long into the future. “It makes you realise the world is a small place and that the opportunities are out there,” he reflects. “It wasn’t something I sought out. I am proud of what I have achieved and what the club has achieved, but there has been a lot of good work that other people have done out in Asia around gaelic football. “It’s not just about gaelic football, it’s about Irish people and how we fit in around the world. We have no real baggage, we are able to adapt and fit into the communities we find ourselves in, and make a positive impact with our culture and with the welcome that we can bring to other people. When you are a teenager you have no idea where the future is going to take you. I had no great expectations or any great career plan. It was all by chance and by opportunity and here I am, sitting in Thailand.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Look what weve done in such a short space of time,” she said. Simone Magill “Theres no words to describe this moment. For all the hard work the girls have put in, these are the moments you play football for. “The girls put in a sht from start to finish and Im delighted for Marissa and Deanothere getting the goals because it gave us a bit of relief going into the end. “Its one of the best days of my le. This was always the dream, ever since I was a little kid, not just to play for Northern Ireland, but to be part of that first group to go to a major tournament. googletag.cmd.push “What a feeling, what a moment for womens football in Northern Ireland and what a moment for every young girl sitting at home, watching this game and seeing the journey weve been on. “Weve got a year now to prepare for this major tournament and the journey weve been on is fantastic, so who knows where well be in a years time.” Sarah McFadden Local interest in the team is strong, with midfielder Chloe McCarron from Coleraine, and both Sarah McFadden and manager Kenny Shiels hailing from Magherafelt.

It is imperative that this report is published and consulted upon so that we can see the stark reality of what key strategists in health here are thinking.ldquoAre we to take the threat of having the Downe and Daisy Hill in Newry reduced to dferent grades of urgent care centres  If we are, then we need to maintain solidarity as a district and not allow this to happento either of our two beloved hospitals.Cllr Savage said the local authority could not get into a ldquoide and conquer approach that saw ldquoone end of the district get more crumbs from the health service table than the other.ldquoWe need to fight to protect and enhance the services at both hospitals. We want services retained and enhanced for our people, he said.The Newry councillor pointed to the -year community campaign for a new Downe Hospital, suggesting that since its foundation stone was laid ldquoit has been a constant battle to retain services, commending the Down Community Health Committee for its work in fighting to retain local services.ldquoWe in this district should not have to constantly look over our shoulder in fear of the centralising grim reapers within the Department of Health attempting to swing the axe again at our cherished local hospitals to enhance services within a cluster of hospitals within the greater Belfast area, declared Cllr Savage.ldquoElected representatives have an obligation to speak up for our people and ensure that we are not treated as second class citizens when it comes to access to local hospital services and first class health care.ldquoThe Department of Health should be looking to enhance local hospitals and a strategy needs to be looked at regionally with the emphasis on fair access to local health services.Highlighting the need to fight to protect the health rights of rural communities across the district, Cllr Savage called for a ldquofair share of specialist services across all hospitals, suggesting thatthe Downe is good enough to provide cataract surgery, it is good enough to provide other services.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to look at the challenges we face in health and ask ourselves are the current engagement structures we have capable of holding decision makers within health to account into the future and could they withstand the body blow of a potential decision to halve the number of current hospitals ldquoWe need to review those structures and a good place to start would be enhanced engagement with the Down Community Health Committee and Daisy Hill Pathfinder Group, inviting these groups to meet with us to discuss their concerns for the future of our local hospitals in a post-Covid world.Cllr Savage said local people required an ldquounequivocal statement from the health minister that there are no plans to reduce the number of hospitals and a ldquocast iron guarantee that there are no plans to downgrade the Downe HospitalHe added: Only when we get a response will we know  the rumours are just rumours.

The post-Christmas lockdown presented yet another challenge to the council and the DfC to target help where it was most needed.The County Down Rural Community Network , Newry Confederation of Community groups and others were asked to set up three brand new distribution centres and allocated over pound, worth of food and essential hygiene and household goods to the area.The Journey Church stepped up to assist in the Downpatrick area and week after week, dozens of their volunteers received the supplies from Lynas Foods, which they made into the ious orders and dispatching them to the ious groups in need. Down Community Transport helped with the bulkier loads.The Clanrye Group were tasked with coordinating the scheme and Kilkeel Development Association looked after the Mournes area. Clanrye collated orders for food and supplies each week and Lynas foods delivered pallets of supplies to this part of the world.Orders were placed each week by local food banks, the St Vincent de Paul Society, Home-Start, Sure Start and other organisations.Nicholas McCrickard, manager of CDRCN, said: ldquoOn behalf of the strategic stakeholder forum, I want to thank Journey Church and all the other groups involved in this gigantic effort.ldquoThe general public may never fully grasp the scale of the operation to keep our foodbanks and SVP stocked and able to answer the great need which has been brought on by the pandemic.ldquoWhile many of us have seen our lives as relatively unaffected, thousands of people have seen their normal weekly incomes and their day to day struggles take a turn for the worse.ldquoThis food pallet scheme and other financial and food security systems have been a leline for many. I want to thank the Maria Keenan from the Clanrye Group in particular and my colleague Daniella McCarry for going well beyond their normal jobs to help people most in need.Daniella said: ldquoWe could not have done this without the volunteers from the Journey Church in Downpatrick. They selflessly gave up days of their own time and rallied to the warehouse to get the vital supplies out to those that needed it most.ldquoThe foodbanks, SVP and our other partners are also to be commended for getting their orders in every week and for getting food and nappies and other products quickly out to local families.Thomas Leavy, from the Journey Churchrsquos leadership team, was the person who co-ordinated the local effort.He said that the church volunteers represented all generations distributed food to Downpatrickrsquos Fountain food bank, St Vincent De Paul in Strangford and Killough, Newcastle and Ballynahinch food bank.ldquoThis is the second time we have partnered with County Down Rural Community Network, he explained.ldquoIn the first lockdown we delivered food parcels, this time we delivered straight to agencies so that they could get the supplies out.ldquoDown Community Transport assisted with the use of several of their buses to deliver supplies furthest away while we did more local deliveries.The church hired the former Down Sports Centre premises in order to have room to break down the thousands of pounds worth of food which came each week on pallets..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/14Apr2021-Backing.jpg","title":"Council backing ban on conversion therapy  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has called for a ban on so-called conversion therapy and increased protection for those in the LGBT+ community.The decision was taken at last weekrsquos monthly meeting of the local authority with the debate including a powerful and moving contribution from Slieve Gullion councillor Pete Byrne, who highlighted the issues that those in the gay community like himself face.Tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown, the motion was not agreed unanimously, with Independent Unionist Henry Reilly voting against it on the grounds that he did not know enough about the issue to make a judgement. The DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna and Kathryn Owen abstained.Cllr Brown urged the local authority to oppose the harm caused to the LGBT+ community in the past through the denial of rights and equal treatment and to recognise that discrimination still occurs today.Councillors have also supported a call to three Stormont ministers mdash Deirdre Hargey, Robin Swann and Naomi Long mdash to introduce an effective ban on conversion therapy within Northern Ireland, supported by a programme of work to help tackle these practices in all their forms.Cllr Brownrsquos motion, which urged the NI Executive and UK government to ban conversion therapy, called on the council to highlight and promote the continued support, counselling and advocacy local groups provide to members of the LGBT+ community.ldquoConversion therapy is a horric practice that has no place in todayrsquos society, Cllr Brown declared.ldquoConversion therapy is a term used to refer to ious dangerous and discredited practices aimed at changing an inidualrsquos sexual orientation or gender identity.ldquoThat could include attempting to change someonersquos sexual orientation from lesbian, gay or bisexual to straight or their gender identity from transgender or non-binary to cisgender.Cllr Brown said this disgraceful practice should not be accepted and permanently banned through legislation.Cllr Byrne mdash who is the SDLP group leader mdash said the fact that the issue was being debated in  was ldquobeyond distressing and as conversion therapy was still openly being practised.ldquoWe canrsquot look at the LGBT community and ask us to speak about it without your support, he told colleagues. ldquoWe need everyone in the chamber to support it and I hope they do.ldquoWe have heard the disappointing and weak response from the equalities minister on the conversion therapy debate in early March and we have waited almost , days since the UK government announced its intention to ban this therapy and we should not have to wait any longer.ldquoItrsquos long past time that the NI Executive stood up together to ban what I think are abusive practices in Northern Ireland and right across the UK, banning all interventions that have the intention of changing, suppressing, converting or cancelling sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.Cllr Byrne said that growing up as gay, he found it incredibly dficult, explaining to his colleagues that he could not express how dficult it had been.ldquoMentally, you torture yourself, you question yourself and you close down, block out your feelings. You literally wear a mask every single day, praying that you donrsquot say something that will give you away.ldquoYou endure enough mental anguish to last a dozen letimes so, to me, when I look back, that is you internally practising a form of conversion therapy on yourself. It is shameful, but that is how you feel growing up, suppressing your own sexual orientation and every LGBT+ person knows the damage that it does, he said, emphasising that allowing conversion therapy to be practised openly or signposting people towards it is ldquobeyond depressing.Cllr Byrne said for most of those in the gay community they ldquogenerally breathe for the first time when they let it all out and to be true to yourself, explaining that the dficulties do not stop there.ldquoYou are confronted as a gay person by many situations that challenge you mentally and while people say lsquothat is the cross you have to bearrsquo it should not be, he continued. ldquoThere is nothing about my sexuality that needs fixed, nothing about it that needs intervention.Cllr Cathy Mason, who seconded the motion, said the practice of conversion therapy sought to ldquodenormalise or completely eradicate a personrsquos sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression and was deeply rooted in ldquointolerance and bigotry.She said those who conducted the therapy regularly exploited the vulnerabilities of young people struggling with their sexuality.She described conversion therapy as a ldquodeeply harmful and regressive practice and that there must be no loopholes on the legislation governing it.Cllr Hanna said the DUP would abstain on the motion, making it clear he had no problems with anyone and takes everyone as he finds them and that conversion therapy was ldquosomething that he would not wish on anyone.Cllr Willie Clarke said no one had the right to question another personrsquos sexuality, while Cllr Reilly askedpeople were ldquoforced into conversion therapy, explaining that he did not know about the issue.However, he suggested that to ban something because ldquoyou did not like a personrsquos ideology or philosophy was the start of a dark path.He said there was a wider context to the issue and that he had a lot of respect for Cllr Byrne.

You have to consider the effects of rip tides as they can come close to the shore and can be a very real danger.Lorna recommends those who are thinking of giving it a try to bring a wetsuit, neoprene socks, a hat, gloves, dry robe, hot drinks and possibly a hot water bottle for afterwards.Swimmers should always aim to gradually heat their body once out of the water by adding layers to prevent going into a hypothermic shock.Also, they are advised to bring a floating aid to be seen safely and wear bright clothes.Lorna, a NHS care worker, first got involved with wild swimming after a colleague informed her of a Bangor-based group called Dash and Splash.Since then, more and more groups have took to the waters in local places such as Newcastle, Ballyhornan and Whiterock. Lornarsquos native Killyleagh have recently formed the cold water group Dippy Flipper swimmers.These groups are highly recommended to beginners as they have invaluable knowledge of the waters they are swimming in..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/14Apr2021-family.jpg","title":"McAlister family raises £3k for Marie Curie nurses  ","story":"A DRUMANESS family have helped raise over pound, for Marie Curie nurses in memory of local woman Peggy McAlister.The money was raised through a series of Easter activities including a virtual raffle and a socially distanced visit to homes in the village from the Easter bunny.Peggy, who was a well known figure in Drumaness, sadly passed away in August . She was under the care of Marie Curie nurses which is why her family decided to raise funds for the charity.Marie Curie offers free care in partnership with NHS to people with terminal illnesses, as well as offering support for family and friends.Lianne Mackin, Peggyrsquos granddaughter, said: ldquoWe decided to do this as something for the kids in the village.ldquoMy granny loved events which involved getting dressed up and having fun so we thought this was a suitable way to raise money in her name.On Easter Sunday, the Easter bunny was driven around the village by Liannersquos uncle, Aidan McAlister, to hand out eggs to the children.A visit from the bunny was made infor a small donation to the charity. A series of spring-themed wreaths were also for sale online with all proceeds going to Marie Curie.Lianne helped organise the event alongside her mother, Margaret, and uncle Aidan.

Thatrsquos been a big bonus, Irsquove played a few minutes more than I thought I would when I signed.ldquoI have settled in well, which is not always the case when you move clubs. Accrington have a great group of lads on the team and theyrsquove made the transition easy for me. Similarly with the manager, John Coleman. So far hersquos been great with me and is giving me the minutes on the pitch.The highly sought after Morgan didnrsquot take long to make his mind up on his move to Accrington, which is less than  miles away from his home, with everything falling into place at the right time.ldquoI was part-time at Southport so being full-time now with Accrington makes le a lot easier. One thing that crossed my mind about having to move clubs is that Irsquove two young children and one is at school. Itrsquos not easy for children to move so in all respects of teams that may have been interested in me, itrsquos the perfect situation not having to move home said Morgan.The midfielder also noted the dference of both training and playing level at his new club, and how he has adapted to his new surroundings on the pitch.ldquoI treated Southport as a full-time role, despite only training two times a week. Irsquom in five times a week with Accrington. We get as much grass work as possible which suits me settling into a new team so I can understand what way they tick, he said.ldquoI hadnrsquot played for two months before I moved to Accrington, due to the league being cancelled at Southport. When I first arrived I was fit, but not match fit. I got thrown in at the deep end due to injuries and noticed instantly the pace of the game is a lot quicker. You donrsquot have time to take extra touches.Accrington Stanley are currently pushing for a place in the play-offs with just six games remaining before the end of the season.Morgan hopes he can help his new team gain promotion to the Championship, but he remains firmly grounded ahead of the next game.ldquoPlay-offs are the aim, every game is massive and we know that as a group. Everyone knows that is the objective for this season but we must take it one game at a time and not overlook anyone he said.Morgan is also looking forward to seeing theof fans, as he is yet to witness a crowd at his new club.ldquoOne of the big things Irsquom looking forward to seeing is the fans in the stadium. Football is not the same without the fans. You associate the two with being normal and you just want that back, he said.ldquoI want my family to experience the football league. They were constantly taking me places to help me develop as a player. I remember my dad racing home from work just to take me to training and I want to repay that with them watching me in the stands.The new No  also paid homage to his former club as he focuses on the next chapter of his career.ldquoIrsquove a special connection with Southport. The staff, volunteers, the team and the club as a whole is something I have a lot of time for. Irsquod love to have a role with the club further down my career to repay them, but for now, I want to be here for the long haul at Accrington.ldquoAt Southport I played my best football, so I want to take that form with me to Accrington.

In October, firefighters fought to bring a malicious blaze under control.They were back at the plant last Saturday just before pm following reports of a fire in an industrial skip which spread to a nearby metal container.Fire crews from Downpatrick and Ballynahinch brought the blaze under control within an hour of the alarm being raised.The fire at the waste oil plant came at the end of three nights of sporadic trouble in the area, with fires started in the middle of the Killough Road which straddles the Model Farm and Flying Horse estates and missiles fired at cars.It is also understood that police on patrol in the area came across a pile of breeze blocks which were removed, fearing they would have been used as missiles to target passing cars.Cllr John Trainor mdash who was a passenger in a car targeted by petrol bombers late on Saturday night mdash has called for an end to the violence, which, he said, is being perpetrated by teenagers hellbent on causing misery for others.He believes that a partnership approach involving the local community, statutory agencies and the police is vital in getting on top of an issue which has resulted in a number of residents living in fear and others afraid to venture out at night.Just before .pm last Saturday, Cllr Trainor was approaching the Model Farm junction when a petrol bomb was hurled at the vehicle by a crowd of up to eight teenagers which included girls and boys. While the missile missed the car, it smashed on the main road and exploded.ldquoA fire had been lit on the main road and there is just no sense to this kind of activity, he declared.ldquoWhatan elderly driver had been confronted by a petrol bomb thrown at them and lost control of their vehicle  I have no doubt that last weekrsquos trouble was cleary pre-meditated.ldquoYou just donrsquot turn up at a housing area and discover petrol bombs. While what happened was clearly planned, it is not reflective of the hard working local people in the area.Cllr Trainor said there was ldquono sense to this kind of activity and questioned how the teenagers were able to get their hands on petrol bombs.He said there had been trouble at the Killough Road some years ago and that a targeted approach involving local groups and statutory agencies had made an impact.ldquoI think we need to go back to this model and there must be community buy-in. It is clear we are talking about a long term commitment as this continued trouble needs to stop. People have had enough and want to be able to live their lives free from the threat of trouble and violence, continued Cllr Trainor.ldquoWe need a strategy and action plan in tandem with an effective policing policy to deal with this issue and a pledge from partner agencies that they will make a long-term commitment. A partnership approach is vital moving forward and must include the local community.Admitting that he was not shocked nor surprised by the petrol bomb attack, Cllr Trainor said what happened could potentially have had ldquocatastrophic consequences with the behaviour witnessed over the past number of days at the Killough Road area nothing knew, insisting that it is in no way reflective of of the people who live locally.ldquoWe have a situation where people are not happy and a number are living in fear. Numerous scenarios could potentially have played out last weekend and I am thankful that they didnrsquot. The the fire in the road, the arson attack at the waste oil plant and the petrol bomb incident will be roundly condemned and rightly so. But they must not be allowed to continue, that is why a strategy to deal with the issue involving all stakeholders is vital.Cllr Trainor added: ldquoWe simply cannot have a situation where violence is prevalent in a part of Downpatrick where people are trying to get on with their lives. They do not need this. Throwing petrol bombs is not entertainment, it is criminality. Anti-social behaviour is often a symptom of other issues in peoplersquos lives which have to be tackled.Agreeing that the recent trouble is not reflective of the wider community, Cllr Oonagh Hanlon revealed that she witnessed some of the incidents including the malicious fires.She said it appeared that the blaze at the Macwaste plant was started deliberately and was ldquoextremely concerning given that the business was targeted last October.ldquoConsidering the highly flammable material stored at the Brannish Road site, it is a miracle that no one was seriously injured, she declared.ldquoCredit to our local firefighters who ensured that the fire did not spread. It is extremely frustrating that emergency services are being distracted from what could be more serious incidents and emergencies. We also had reports of petrol bombs being thrown at cars passing through the area last week.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoIt is hugely disappointing and frustrating that this type of behaviour continues in this area. Do the perpetrators of these crimes realise the impact of their actions ldquoI would appeal to anyone with information about what happened and those involved to provide it to the authorities and ask the community to continue to report suspicious behaviour as people are fed up with the actions of a small minority.

My father described the Prince as the perfect gentleman.ldquoHis sad passing does indeed mark the end of a era Prince Philip was truly unique and I know that from talking to my dad that he enjoyed his visits to Northern Ireland. The Prince will be missed most by his family, but he has left an indelible mark and the success of his Duke of Edinburgh award scheme is unparalleled.Terry said the torch for environmental issue which was taken up Sir David Attenborough so many years ago was one once carried by Prince Philip whose care for the such an important issue has been passed to his eldest son Prince Charles.He added: ldquoPrince Philip has left his mark on this world and there are many people from Northern Ireland who have met him over the years.ldquoThey recall a man with an infectious sense of duty and one who could also be humorous at times, using this aspect of his character to put others at ease.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMonday, April , marks the official ftieth birthday of Chapter Arts Centre in Cardf.The multi-artform venue was the first of its kind in Wales.CEO of Chapter, Andy Eagle said: ldquoChapter was originally set up by a community of artists and that remains its foundation and principal purpose. Itrsquos an eclectic and fascinating place that has, over the last fty years, evolved to be welcoming and inclusive to many dferent types of peopleChapter Arts Centre came to le thanks to the driving force of writer Mik Flood and artists Christine Kinsey and Bryan Jones.CEO Chapter Andy Eagle. Photo Kirsten McTernanDiscussions about the opening of an arts centre in Cardf started in  and were part of a vision for a space where artists could produce and present work, free from commercial pressures. Experimental work was seen as key to its identity, and the needs of artists were at its heart.The venue was formerly Canton High School, and the initial period of set up was a demanding time. The founders, and a gang of enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers, lovingly cleared, restored and adapted the building to make it fit for purpose as Walesrsquo first arts centre.The first official Board meeting was held on  April  and in July that year Chapter opened its doors with a temporary cinema, gallery and bar, and with former classrooms used as studios, workshops and offices. Chapter Fundraising gig, Pavilions in the Park. Photo courtesy of Christine KinseyToabout the history of Chapter and itrsquos early years between  and , visit: www.issuu chapter docs earlyyears_copy.Five decades on, Chapter has grown into one of the largest arts complexes in Europe, with two cinemas, two theatres, a gallery, a large number of artistsrsquo studios and creative industry offices, meeting places for the community and a cafeacute bar.Chapter in the early daysIt produces and presents the best in national and international contemporary visual art, experimental and thought-provoking performance, and challenging independent, mainstream and international films, all alongside an inclusive learning and engagement programme.     Every year, the venue welcomes , visitors to more than  film screenings,  live performances,  visual art exhibitions and  community classes, artisan fairs and events.Mr Eagle added: ldquoChapter is many dferent things to many dferent people. For some, it will be the international gallery exhibitions and the programme of independent films.\"For others, it will be the cafeacute bar and restaurant to meet friends before a Cardf City home game, or it will be for dance and theatre classes or a cup of tea before working in the community garden.\"But at its heart itrsquos a centre for contemporary art, supporting artists and creatives from Wales and beyond to produce and present work.Chapter works with practitioners at every stage in their careers, supporting and stimulating opportunities for exciting new talent as well as promoting the work of established artists.It is a springboard for the creative community of Wales with a focus on bringing the world to Wales and Wales to the world.Chapter is home to over  of Walesrsquo most dynamic creative companies and artists, including BAFTA Cymru, Printhaus, ie ie Productions, Everyman Theatre, Beryl Productions, Cardf Music School and Taking Flight Theatre. Chapter has remained open to this creative community during the pandemic.MORE NEWS:They also offer a range of spaces in support of local artists and companies for the research and development of artistic projects, including Hijinx Theatre.Like most art and entertainment venues, the last year has been one of the most dficult times for the organisation as they were forced to close their doors. MrEagle commented: ldquoClosure has had a massive impact on us. We are an arts organisation that generates almost all of its income through ticket sales, classes, hires, cafeacute bar and other activity.\"The small remaining amount comes fromArts Council of Wales and is used to support our arts and education programme. Our capacity to earn incomeliterally stopped overnight and that was profoundly scary.Support has been generated from extremely generous public donations and from a range of funders including Arts Council Wales, Welsh Government, BFI, Art Fund, Ffilm Cymru and Admiral.Since its closure, Chapter has offered an exciting Chapter from Home programme, consisting of over  virtual film screenings, online theatre productions and art exhibitions, monthly online comedy gigs presented by Welsh comedian Robin Morgan, virtual lectures with Arts Society Cardf, as well as outdoor theatre performances with Cardf-based companies including Theatr Iolo and Kitsch  Sync.Currently showing at Chapteris internationally focussed art exhibition Artes Mundi. The exhibition is available to view online ndash and in-venue as soon as itrsquos allowed.

Artes Mundi - Carrie Mae Weems RESIST COVID TAKE ! - Photo Stuart WhippsThe works focus on the global pandemic that continues to affect us all, and in particular its impact on people of colour. In the Gallery are immersive works by South African artist Dineo Seshee Bopape - objects, drawing and sound are presented in spaces with walls covered in washes of soil from Welsh sacred sites.Talking about the programme since Chapter closed, Director of Programme Hannah Firth said: ldquoWhen our doors closed in March last year we wanted to ensure that we could still talk to our audiences and the creative community that is our beating heart.\"Despite the uncertainty faced by many artists, they showed an astonishing resilience and desire to quickly adapt to other ways of working and engaging.\"Wersquove been lucky enough to be able to work with some of them to create a dynamic programme of events and activity online and outdoors, and have developed a number of key commissions to support artists including on our lightbox, in our cafeacute bar, in our gallery, around the Canton community, and online.Chapter is currently getting ready to re-open. Depending on Covid guidelines, they hope to welcome customers back outdoors sometime after Easter, and they have been working hard to improve their outdoor catering offer to keep visitors warm and cosy day and night.Although Chapter canrsquot bring everyone together for a big Birthday party as planned, they will celebrate their five decades through to next April with a series of special events, activities and online content - they particularly have some exciting plans for outdoor events this summer.Mr Eagle said: ldquoNeedless to say  is not the year we were anticipating for our th!ldquoWhile the move to digital is great in many ways, ultimately, people want to be able to enjoy themselves and meet and do things in person.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityA specially recalled, remotely attended plenary session was told that Prince Philip had also held the title of Earl of Merioneth and championed ldquoa broad ersity of causes in Wales.Following a minutersquos silence at am today, Mr Drakeford told the Senedd: ldquoA very long le in any circumstances, brings with it a set of remarkable events witnessed and experiences, enjoyed or endured.ldquoTo have lived such a le at the centre of world events and in a way which made almost every experience of public, rather than simply private interest, makes it even more remarkable still, and that was the le of the Duke of Edinburgh.Mr Drakeford said the Royal Family were among many families who had lost a loved one during the coronavirus pandemic, and that whatever the circumstances ldquoeach loss is uniquely felt by those for whom that person will leave a gap in their lives which no one  can fill.ldquoOur thoughts today are with those members of the wider Royal Family who have to face that loss in the particularly distressing circumstances caused by the public health emergency, he said.The Welsh Labour leader said Philip was one of the very few people who had witnessed many changes to le in the UK while having to ldquoabsorb them all, while almost never out of the public eye.The Earl of Merioneth title was given to Philip on the day of his wedding to Queen Elizabeth in , along with the titles Baron Greenwich and Duke of Edinburgh.The dukersquos relationship with Merioneth, a historic county in north Wales, meant it was ldquono surprise he was a supporter of a number of associations and societies in the area, Mr Drakeford said, including its cricket club, sailing club and brass band.He was later given his Welsh bardic title Philip Meirionnydd by the archdruid of Wales, Mr Edgar Phillips, after being initiated an Honorary Ovateof the Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod, at Sophia Gardens, Cardf in August .     Mr Drakeford added: ldquoOn behalf of the Welsh Government and those supporting the government in this parliament, which was another huge development during his letime, I extend our sincerest sympathies at the end of an exceptional le lived.:Leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, said Philip had ldquooffered so much to so many people including through the Duke of Edinburgh Awards or the serving and former members of the Armed Forces.ldquoHis own military service saw him play a key role in the struggles of World War Two, and he never forgot the men and women he served with and the countless thousands who followed, Mr Davies said.Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said: ldquoWe are here not only to grieve but also to thank Prince Philip for his letimersquos contribution.ldquoItrsquos not a title or status or crown that is Prince Philiprsquos most important legacy that we celebrate today but the support that he provided to others.The Duke of Edinburgh last visited the Senedd while accompanying the Queen to the opening of the fth session of the-then National Assembly for Wales in .Campaigning for the May  Senedd election was postponed over the weekend following Philiprsquos death, but was set to resume for all parties following Mondayrsquos recalled parliament plenary. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
