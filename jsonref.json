Bright-yellow stripes are being applied to the pavement at now-familiar two-metre intervals outside the school’s three sets of gates, and over the next few days, these markers will appear in classrooms, too. In between, dedicated routes will be laid out to take children safely from the school gates to their classroom doors.These plans, orchestrated by Bonneville’s headteacher, Andrea Parker, were being rolled out as the school prepared to reopen its doors to reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils in line with the latest government guidelines. Schools, colleges and nurseries across England welcomed more children and students from 1 June onwards – and headteachers like Parker are busy preparing to embrace a new way of learning.“For every headteacher, keeping children safe is going to be at the top of their priorities”, says Parker, who is also the lead headteacher for Jessop primary and Stockwell primary schools. “We began our preparations by sending out a survey to check the pulse of how teachers and parents were feeling about returning to school. From there, we were able to start modelling what we need to do to support our families, and help them to feel more confident in sending their children back.”Since lockdown, the school has continued to take in around 25 of its 420 pupils each day, split into smaller groups for safety – the children of key workers, those from vulnerable families, or with education, health and care plans in place. “We’ve been open every day during lockdown,” says Parker. “Staff members even volunteered to work through the holidays, which has been fantastic.”Meanwhile, those teachers who have remained at home have been working on providing the online resources parents need for home schooling. “Overnight, we’ve all had to completely change how we work on a day-to-day basis with no training and no transition period, and teachers have been working incredibly hard to achieve that,” she says.At the same time, Parker believes temporary home schooling can’t replace the benefits of schools-based education, especially when it comes to the transitions experienced by those children who will begin returning to school from 1 June.“Reception, year 1 and year 6 are all key milestones,” she says. “Younger children are in the early stages of their education, and we want to be there for them as they develop their reading and friendship groups, and simply learn how to learn.“At the other end of the spectrum, year 6 are about to go to secondary school. It’s a time when they celebrate their SATs and everything they’ve achieved and worked hard for.”The Bonneville school building, which dates back to 1905, is large and welcoming. When I visit, days before reopening, crafted cardboard models of sea animals hang from the ceilings, and children’s work covers every inch of spare space on the walls.With only a fraction of the school’s 420 pupils in attendance – including Parker’s own six-year-old daughter, who is in school as the child of a key worker – the sound of children’s laughter, which usually fills these hallways, can only faintly be heard drifting in from the playground.“Our teachers are very excited and as desperate to see the children as I am,” she says. “They’re anxious, too, but going through our risk assessments with them has helped a lot.“With fewer children coming back to start with, we don’t need everybody to be here, which means those who are very anxious can be asked to come back later on. Hopefully they’ll see how things are working and their confidence will build – some people just need that, much like the parents who need to have a choice.”Home schooling for those children who remain at home will continue to be supported by teachers, but to reassure those who do send their children in, a raft of safety measures has been put in place.At the school gates, parents are required to socially distance from each other (guided by those painted stripes) during staggered drop-offs. “Bubbles” of up to 15 children will be dropped off together, with an allocated “bubble lead” – the class teacher – taking students into the building in shifts.Before entering their classroom, they sanitise their hands before being allocated a desk each for taking lessons, watching pre-recorded assemblies, and eating lunch, which will be delivered at the door. Outside space will be utilised for lessons as much as possible, while playtime and PE will be enjoyed within the children’s inidual groups.“Although younger children will be in smaller groups, it’s not just about the size of each bubble – it’s about dynamics as well,” says Parker. “Children are people with their own personalities and their own way of being, so we have to make sure each one is a manageable group and dynamic.”Extra hygiene measures include specific play and sports equipment allocated to each bubble, regular handwashing, staggered bathroom breaks followed by janitor cleaning, and early closing on Friday afternoons for deep-cleaning sessions. The early Friday closure will also be used to facilitate statutory planning and preparation time for teachers. The school has also drawn up sets of principles that parents, teachers and children will be asked to adhere to.For staff, these include having an awareness of each other – for example, no more than two teachers in the staffroom at a time. For children, the principles include reinforcing the NHS’s Catch it, Bin it, Kill it messaging. For parents, coming to collect children as quickly as possible if they fall ill.Bonneville has also worked to tailor specific solutions to the erse community the school serves. “In terms of the country Lambeth is hugely erse”, says Parker, citing the borough’s significant Caribbean, African and Asian communities, as well as pupils from Spanish-, French- and Portuguese-speaking backgrounds.“We know that the BAME community have surfaced as being prone to having a higher rate of infection”, says Parker, explaining that the school’s risk assessment process is being developed with the heightened vulnerability of BAME students, staff and their wider community in mind.Communicating to children why their schools have changed is a crucial part of helping them adapt to their new regimes, so Parker plans to share a virtual tour of the new school layout with pupils, and plug lessons about the roles of key workers into the curriculum.Parker’s plans have focused on building confidence among children, staff and parents, and communicating with them every step of the way. “It’s about trying to adapt, even though we don’t know how long we’re going to be adapting for,” she says.Check with your Local Authority for the latest news on schools opening in your area.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

How has ‘the straw bale house’ endured?“I’m a real believer in trying things,” says the architect Sarah Wigglesworth. “That’s how you learn. Taking risks is really important. I’m interested in the things that give a kind of joy and maybe disrupt things. I am interested in pushing boundaries. Anything that does that is good.”Wigglesworth – who was appointed MBE in 2004 and became the first woman to receive the Royal Designer for Industry award for architecture in 2012 – is describing herself, but she could easily be talking about how she designed her home in north London. 910 Stock Orchard Street is the multi-award-winning livework space of Wigglesworth and her partner, Jeremy Till. Built 20 years ago, the “straw bale house”, as it was invariably called, instigated a debate about the aesthetics of eco-architecture. “At that time,” Wigglesworth recalls, “the green movement was about dropping out to north Wales or somewhere and building something quite vernacular with your hands. We wanted to make an urbane version of that, in an urban setting.”As a practice, Sarah Wigglesworth Architects (SWA) has since become renowned for its life-enhancing public buildings, including social housing, schools and community centres. However, during the two-year Stock Orchard Street build, the practice almost folded, so all-consuming was the work. The couple had sold their home and, for nine months, Wigglesworth lived on-site in a caravan. (“In the spring and summer, it felt like a holiday camp, but by winter it was damp and miserable.”) Till – who is now head of Central St Martins and pro vice-chancellor of University of the Arts London – spent his weeks up north as the head of the school of architecture at Sheffield University. Wigglesworth was appointed to Sheffield at the same time (she was a professor of architecture there until 2016) but took a sabbatical to concentrate on the project.The L-shaped building is situated at the end of a short residential road. On one side is a row of semi-detached, Victorian villas, on the other a busy railway track that slopes towards King’s Cross. The couple bought the plot at auction in the mid-90s. At the time, it was a working forge: part-gas furnace, part-junkyard. It wasn’t until the site was cleared that they realised just how large it was. At the same time, they had regular visits from a film crew: their straw bale house featured in the first series of Grand Designs. Ten minutes into that episode, Wigglesworth tells presenter Kevin McCloud: “In a way, I don’t really care what the outcome is: I just want to build it.” She feels now that the technical aspects of the build weren’t fully showcased that she and Till were “actors in a drama”. “The production company understood TV, but they weren’t familiar with the complexities of getting a building out of the ground,” she says. The project was delayed, so the producers introduced a distracting subplot in which McCloud builds his own rural, straw bale cabin. That said, there have since been two “revisits” and 910 Stock Orchard Street remains “one of Kevin’s favourites”.When it was finished, the editor of the Architectural Review, Peter Davey, called the straw-bale house “the most sexy and witty building I have seen for years”. He predicted that it “will be seen as one of the most gallant experiments in eco-architecture of our age”. He was right.To enter 910 Stock Orchard Street, you pass through a fence of woven willow and galvanised steel. This opens on to a series of vertical gabions (“cages” filled with lumps of recycled concrete). These piers support the office wing, which is clad on one wall with weathered sandbags, filled with cement and lime, which absorb the rumble from the adjacent railway line (the inspiration was a photo of Swansea’s plate-glass-windowed Kardomah coffee house during the blitz). Above the office door, the facade is swaddled in silicone-faced fibreglass – a kind of wipe-clean quilt, which is “buttoned” to the structure of the building.Wigglesworth’s home is connected to the office via a double-height conferencedining room. The dining table is pivotal for Wigglesworth. Her drawing, “The Disorder of the Dining Table”, is an exploration of order and control in architecture. It depicts three dining tables in various states of use: before a dinner party, with chairs tucked in and places set during, a scribble of movement and after, a mess of crumpled napkins and abandoned plates. Wigglesworth calls the drawing a “post-rationalisation of the idea that we were fighting very hard against: this concept of the perfect product”. For Wigglesworth, the rituals of eating are analogous to the rituals of domestic life. “We were designing this in the mid-to-late 90s, when sheer glass and very minimal interiors were the sort of gold standard of architectural homes. But we wanted the mess, we wanted the dirt – we wanted our home to be able to accept all the spills of everyday life.”The conferencedining room connects to the living space via a sliding door made from heavily patterned douglas fir. The reveal is dramatic – like a sheet falling off a sculpture. The space Wigglesworth has created for the scribbles and spills of everyday life is full of light, texture and colour – but mostly, it is full of ideas.The steel-and-timber structure of the living and sleeping quarters has been insulated with 550 barley straw bales. These are covered by sheets of corrugated, galvanised steel on the outside, and rendered with lime plaster on the inside. On one facade, the steel has been replaced by sheets of clear polycarbonate, revealing a glimpse of the insulative straw bales, which, 20 years on, are as golden as the day they were first laid. (Unlike the polycarbonate sheets, which are cracked and taped together in parts.)A “summer ventilation strategy” has also been incorporated into the design. On warm days, a series of louvres in the lobby can be opened. These draw cool air into the building, while hot air is pulled out through another louvre system at the top of a five-storey tower, the couples’ library and creative “eyrie”. The larder – a central area of cool that looks like a giant anthill – separates the living space from the kitchen. It functions in much the same way, with vents at the top and bottom. “One of the things we were unpacking was this idea about re-learning technologies,” says Wigglesworth. “Of course, now we have fridges, but there are ways of keeping food cool without recourse to energy.”This year, SWA marked its 25th anniversary by hosting an exhibition at the Anise gallery in London. For the show, each studio member presented a piece of work made in response to some of SWA’s most memorable projects. For Wigglesworth, the exhibition represented a way of “stepping back” and “democratically reflecting” upon the themes in architecture during those years.Gender inequality in architecture is one of those recurrent themes. In the mid-90s, Wigglesworth co-curated an exhibition, symposium and accompanying book called Desiring Practices: Architecture, Gender and the Interdisciplinary. Twenty five years later, the issue “has come round again”. Today, Wigglesworth is a member of Part W, an action group of women “calling out gender discrimination in an industry that routinely excludes”. Wigglesworth says: “I sometimes go to meetings with a younger male colleague, in which I will ask the questions, and the person I’m addressing will answer my young, male colleague. I find that almost unbelievable, but that still happens.”For their first campaign, Part W drew attention to the fact that, since 1848, the Riba Royal Gold Medal had been awarded to just one woman in her own right. By crowd-sourcing an alternative list of women who have been overlooked for the medal, they highlighted how female architects have been routinely underacknowledged. This year’s award went to Part W’s co-founders: Grafton Architects. The organisation is also interested in ensuring women’s viewpoints are given equal representation in education, histories of architecture and speaking platforms (“there are too many ‘manels’”). “For too long, bodies that are responsible for creating the discourse, and that represent the industry, have not paid enough attention to doing this,” says Wigglesworth.In the 20 years since 910 Stock Orchard Street was built, the green movement has evolved. Building regulations have changed and techniques for analysing energy efficiency have improved. Wigglesworth’s timber windows had warped and part of the roof will not stop leaking. (“I shouldn’t tell you that, should I? No architect’s roof ever leaks.”) It was time for a renovation.At the beginning of last year, SWA commissioned the energy consultancy Enhabit to assess the building’s performance, including thermal imaging and airtightness tests. They pored over energy bills, measured the U-values of the building fabric (how effectively their sandbags, steel and straw act as insulators), and fed the data into Passivhaus software to determine the energy efficiency of the building. The research highlighted areas that needed rethinking. For Wigglesworth, the work that ensued is a continuation of their initial concept: “It is part of sustainability, this idea that buildings are cherished. Your home should be treated as if it were a part of your body – which in a way, it is. It is a kind of bigger expression of yourself, and you need to look after it.”Now they have reinsulated and re-rendered the large glass wall in the living space and the “undercroft” (the area underneath the raised, open-plan living space). The warped timber windows have been replaced and a section of polycarbonate roof has been replaced with rooflights and blackout blinds. And, “after much discussion”, a new boiler has been fitted. “We were wondering if we should put an air-source heat pump in,” says Wigglesworth. “But we decided not to on the basis that, by the time this needs replacing in 20 years, the technology will have improved massively.” (Already, she is thinking of the next renovation.)They have removed a wall between the tower and the living area, so losing a redundant corridor. The floor has been replaced with engineered, oiled oak, the window frames painted in either green or blue, and the walls and woodwork in gloriously off-kilter shades of coral pink and pale lilac (“I’m not very good at colour,” she confides. “I find it really, really hard.”)At the age of 62, Wigglesworth has – alongside improving energy efficiency – made the building more age-friendly. The composting toilet has been decommissioned (“I don’t want to be maintaining that when I’m 80”), helping create room for a self-contained annex on the ground floor, which may, some day, be lived in by a carer. In the kitchen, gas rings have been replaced with an induction hob and an eye-level oven. Accessible drawers have been installed. There are even handrails on the bath.

The novelist embodied an elusive feeling that the English teen was determined to claim for herself: le bien-être, “so much sexier and more exciting than the mealy-mouthed, goody-goody, Goop-esque ‘wellbeing’”. In the decades since, her quest has led her to French writers from Colette to Balzac she shares their wisdom in this biblio-memoir, a book whose chic swagger is balanced by cleverness and some very Anglo self-deprecation.\u0026nbspA year ago, Olivia’s father left for a meditation retreat and never returned.

Over the course of a summer, she bands together with a tight-knit trio of other girls eager to be inducted into the art of weightlessness. It all makes for a psychologically smart debut that swathes teen desire and friendship in dark mystery and mirth.\u0026nbspThere’s doomy fascination to be had from the antics of the artists, writers and socialites who descended on the south of France during the 1930s and partied on as fascism swept across the continent.

Blending glittering social detail with meticulous wartime history, de Courcy crafts a compelling account of a chilling historical juxtaposition.

For at least two decades there has been talk of how town centres need to be rethought. The pandemic has made the need for action critical.The next few weeks are not going to be a problem. Consumers, having been cooped up for so long, will be out in force when non-essential stores open for business on 15 June. Even though consumer confidence is extremely low, the lack of spending opportunities since the country went into hibernation in late March means that many people are both cash rich and in need of some retail therapy. High streets will get the benefit of a post-lockdown sugar rush.Rishi Sunak has provided help for the retail sector by providing grants, a business rates holiday, a deferral of VAT payments and wage subsidies for furloughed workers. These, though, are only short-term fixes from the chancellor. The VAT still has to be paid the business rates holiday will end the furlough scheme is being wound up at the end of October.Before too long, the old familiar problems – and some new ones – will need to be addressed. Problem number one is that the shift of big retailers to edge of town locations has meant there is excess retail capacity in many high streets. Put simply, in many town centres there are now far too many shops given the amount of spending that is actually taking place.Problem number two is digital disruption: the ever-increasing share of spending that is happening online. The future of the traditional department store looks bleak because any consumer can have the department-store experience on their laptop or smart phone, only with lower prices and without the inconvenience of getting the bus into town or finding somewhere to park the car.Problem number three is that even those consumers who were late adopters to the idea of online shopping have now had a taste of it during the lockdown. Retailers fear that even those who like the physical pleasure of leafing through the books in Waterstones or trying on a dress in Jigsaw will bridle at having to mask up if they want to use public transport and wait in a socially distanced queue before they can be safely admitted to a shop. Given how easy the alternative is, those fears are well-merited.The outlook is bleaker in towns than in big cities, and bleakest of all in the old industrial towns, where the hollowing out of manufacturing in the 1980s has been followed out by the hollowing out of retailing in the past two decades. Getting town centres humming again is central not just to economic regeneration but to improving wellbeing. The boarded-up shops, the pawnbrokers and the fast food outlets, according to a paper on England’s health inequalities by the Bennett school of public policy at Cambridge University, are closely linked to their inhabitants’ health outcomes.The paper found that the built environment of towns, including the provision of green spaces and the kind of retail options they provided, made a real difference to life expectancy, prevalence of lung cancer and levels of obesity among children. In the more deprived towns, the previous upward trend in life expectancy had stalled or even gone into reverse.Against the backdrop of a higher incidence of Covid-19 in the poorer parts of the country, the authors of the paper conclude: “There is an overriding need for policies to address the large and widening gaps in the health and economic fortunes of many towns, and these should be integral to the ‘levelling up’ and economic recovery agendas.”Thus far, it has to be said, there doesn’t appear to be much of an economic recovery agenda. There is plenty of crisis management going on and a sense that the government is responding to events rather than planning for the future. Hence the weekend talk of speeding up the reopening of the hospitality sector because of fears of massive job losses.The wartime coalition government found time to commission the Beveridge report, rethink education policy and sketch out plans for post-war full employment. A similar approach will be needed to reinvigorate town centres as part of a wider regeneration programme.Some things are obvious. In most parts of the country, town centres will be about more than retail. Instead, the idea should be to make the middle of towns and smaller cities places were people live and work, not just shop. That would help in two ways: it would reduce the average age of the population, and it would encourage the growth of businesses to cater for the demands of young, working people with money to spend.Nicholas Falk, who founded Urbed in the 1970s – a consultancy that specialises in urban development and regeneration – made a number of suggestions that would make a difference, noted in a recent article for the Academy of Urbanism journal. These included the redevelopment of redundant retail space and surplus car parks into homes, workplaces and community hubs or social spaces. Local authorities, he says, should take over key buildings if they lie empty too long, as happened in bomb-damaged Comprehensive Development Areas after the second world war.“Where town centre development is no longer viable, retailing will have to contract so better uses can take over. This requires government to play a more proactive role. Publicly owned land could be pooled, as it is in Copenhagen and Hamburg, with compulsory purchase orders used as a threat.”All sensible stuff. What is needed is a government strategy for urban regeneration that involves the devolution of both power and money to a local level, plus a recognition that the time to act is now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d79647446eb9f2766bffdf17cd54a20ae8182209/0_1073_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=064faddadfef793e7f6e09544d48f1ec","title":"covid 19 vaccine astrazeneca approached gilead over possible merger","story":"If the report is accurate, the £200bn merger would be the biggest ever healthcare dealAstraZeneca has approached its rival Gilead Sciences about a potential merger, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday.Any merger, which would be the biggest healthcare deal on record, would bring together two of the companies leading the pharmaceutical industry’s efforts to develop a vaccine and treatments for Covid-19.A combination of the two would be valued at about £200bn. AstraZeneca, which is valued at £110bn, recently overtook Royal Dutch Shell to become the UK’s largest company by market value. Gilead was valued at about $96bn (£74bn) at Friday night’s closing price.AstraZeneca contacted Gilead in May, but did not provide the terms of any transaction, the report  said.A spokeswoman for AstraZeneca said the company did comment on rumours or speculation. Gilead did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The two firms and several other drugmakers, including Eli Lilly, Pfizer and Merck, are racing to develop a vaccine and treatments for Covid-19.More than 6.9 million people are reported to have been infected with the coronavirus globally and 399,025 have died, a Reuters tally showed on Sunday.Bloomberg said Gilead had discussed the merger idea with advisers, but that no decision had been made on how to proceed and the companies were not in formal talks. Gilead was not interested in selling to or merging with another big pharmaceutical company, and preferred to focus on partnerships and smaller acquisitions, the report said.AstraZeneca said last week that it had doubled manufacturing capacity for its potential coronavirus vaccine to 2bn doses in two deals involving the Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates that guaranteed early supply to lower income countries.It is unclear if the vaccine will work, but AstraZeneca’s partnership with Oxford University to develop one is among a handful of initiatives backed by Donald Trump’s Covid taskforce.Gilead has also been at the forefront. Its remdesivir antiviral drug is the first to lead to improvement in Covid-19 patients in formal clinical trials."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95a5c4d7560e0f0d21ebf8a55669bdc40b8af291/124_208_1876_1125/master/1876.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94da42c205898dd8a91fc0052e29bac0","title":"manufacturing in the pandemic in pictures","story":"A photo record of how industries and factories adapted to the Covid-19 crisis"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ab7bfbd2617a37e51a591df7af6b9f168ab9d72/222_100_2057_1234/master/2057.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2877e1d0dc47072e66f9f53ed77f42f","title":"a royal conspiracy against john bercow perhaps im imagining it","story":"There’s no hard evidence the Duchess of Cambridge wants to block the former Speaker’s peerage, but just look at her views on tightsDo Jacob Rees-Mogg and the Duchess of Cambridge think John Bercow should get a peerage I wonder? Inidually, I mean. I’m not expecting the two of them to have an agreed line. I doubt they’ve even discussed it. I have no idea what they talk about, if I’m being totally honest. In fact, have they actually met? Well, I imagine so. In fact, I’m imagining so now.“So, Your Royal Highness, do you think that the former Speaker of the House of Commons should be granted a peerage?”So they did talk about it!If you’re doubting whether the text of my imagined encounter between Jacob Rees-Mogg and the Duchess of Cambridge is a sound basis for inferring anything about them then you’re clearly not a Tatler reader because the profile of the duchess in its JulyAugust issue, published at the end of May (magazines are so weird!), is a majestic demonstration of the insightful power of guesswork.It is filled with quotations from people explaining the various strengths and weaknesses of the duchess and her circle (as the duke calls it), but virtually the only attributed statement in the whole long, long feature is something Cecil Beaton once said about the Queen Mother. And neither of them is likely to sue. At least not without access to one of the psychics whom, according to the article, “both William and Kate consult”.This last snippet of information appears to have come from “a medium who went to Kensington Palace to ‘channel’ for them” (the gutters in those old buildings can be a nightmare) and that’s pretty much the most specific citing of a source that Anna Pasternak, the author of the piece, goes in for. Otherwise, it’s all phrases that could mean almost anyone: “royal insiders” and “society figures”, “a good friend”, “another friend”, “one member of the young royal set”, “a friend of Donna Air”, “another country grandee” and “Hilary Mantel”.In that context, my own imaginings about the duchess’s chats with Rees-Mogg seem completely valid. So perhaps we should see how the two of them are getting on…“No I don’t want to look at it, thank you Mr Rees-Mogg and I think you should probably show it to a doctor.”Damn! The conversation’s moved on. Now we’ll never know what I imagine they both think about John Bercow’s suitability for elevation. By which I mean ennoblement, not special shoes he’s taken to wearing.The issue of Bercow’s peerage has been controversial because, while it is customary to offer outgoing Speakers peerages, Bercow is particularly hated by the Tories even though he sort of is one. He made all their attempts to force Brexit through before the last election really difficult and, entirely coincidentally no doubt, has been referred to the parliamentary commissioner over allegations of bullying. But that provides Downing Street with the excuse not to approve his nomination to the Lords and thereby mete out a historically unprecedented humiliation.It’s this breach of precedent that leads me to speculate about Rees-Mogg and the duchess’s views. They seem to be real precedent junkies. For example, it’s at Rees-Mogg’s insistence, in his role as leader of the house, that from last week MPs are once again voting in person. Hundreds of them have been distance queueing all over the parliamentary estate as if there were something at the end of it even a tenth as interesting or important as a branch of Ikea. Instead, there’s just the opportunity to either cravenly do Boris Johnson’s bidding or impotently oppose it, in a slightly more infectious and hugely more time-consuming way than before.It’s happening despite the fact that the parliamentary remote-voting system was probably the only wholly competent aspect of the government’s entire pandemic response. The development also effectively removed democratic representation from the millions whose local MPs are self-isolating. That’s now been tweaked to allow proxy voting but we’ve learned what Rees-Mogg is willing to sacrifice for tradition. In that context, a peerage going to a man he dislikes is surely a tiny price to pay to conserve the ancient convention of former Speakers always getting peerages?As for Kate Middleton (I prefer her old name – it sounds less like a boat), she’s also a big fan of protocol if “another friend of the Cambridges” is to be believed. This was the juicy Tatler revel-alleg-ation that she’d had a disagreement with the Duchess of Sussex, as she then wasn’t, at the latter’s wedding rehearsal, over whether the bridesmaids should wear tights. “Kate, following protocol, felt that they should. Meghan didn’t want them to.”Before we conclude too much from this about the all-important Bercow situation, it should be noted that Kensington Palace has taken an unusually dim view of the Tatler unattributed-sourceathon, saying: “This story contains a swathe of inaccuracies and false misrepresentations which were not put to Kensington Palace prior to publication.” Interesting. To me, the article initially read like pure horseshit, but there’s something about someone pointing at some horseshit and exclaiming: “That’s pure horseshit, there are no diamonds of truth in there at all!” that can make you think again.Tatler’s response to this response, incidentally, was: “We can confirm we have received correspondence from lawyers acting for the Duke and the Duchess of Cambridge and believe it has no merit.” But I don’t think that would stop them from printing it in their SeptemberOctober issue if it hadn’t gone to press last March.But we’re forgetting something. John Bercow was the first Speaker of the House of Commons not to wear court dress. He broke with protocol and refused to put on tights. He’s dead to her. Maybe he can make a go of it in Hollywood."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46beeb595a3f2ac9e5e0cfd3b66c37ea9e84aaa3/0_345_5906_3544/master/5906.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=b17889ff75132ea1b626576538beaebd","title":"britain is not america but we too are disfigured by deep and pervasive racism","story":"Yes, it would be foolish to see only parallels in the US and UK experience. But to downplay our own problems would be shamefulOne of the more pertinent statements made during this past extraordinary week appeared in one of the last places I would have thought to look – in the pages of Vogue, not a publication I instinctively turn to at a moment of profound political tension.\u0026nbsp“Racism is a global issue. Racism is a British issue. It is not one that is merely confined to the United States – it is everywhere, and it is systemic,” wrote Edward Enninful, the editor-in-chief of the magazine’s British edition. The ubiquity of racism has been brought to stark and sudden attention by the killing of George Floyd and by the unprecedented wave of protests, demonstrations and rioting that followed.Filmed by many witnesses and now viewed millions of times, the killing of Floyd by a Minnesota policeman, a 21st-century lynching, is so sickening a crime that the revulsion it has induced has become a global phenomenon.The demonstrators and activists who have taken to the streets have, however, been motivated by more than revulsion. They have also been stirred to action by acknowledging a fundamental truth – that the killing of Floyd has to be understood as a symptom of systemic racism. By building their campaign around that reality they have promoted radical and challenging conversations – in countries on both sides of the Atlantic – about the nature of racism and the actions that people of all races can take in eliminating it. These are conversations that we have needed for a very long time.Led by young people, many of them inspired by Black Lives Matter, and involving people of all ethnicities, the protests have morphed into a worldwide anti-racist movement. No longer is this moment solely about police violence nor is it limited to America. Both online and on the streets it is calling out racism, wherever it exists and in whatever forms it is found. In both the US and in Europe, people are asking, tentatively, if this might be a defining moment of change.Yet in the immediate aftermath of Floyd’s death there was little reason to imagine anything would be any different this time around. For African Americans, one of the most appalling aspects of Floyd’s murder was that they had seen it all before. The same story with the same outcome, all that changed was the name of the victim – Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice, Philando Castile, Walter Scott.For many black Britons, Floyd’s death stirred memories of another list of names, those of the members of their community killed or rendered disabled in similar circumstances at the hands of the British police or immigration officers. On Tuesday, the Black Cultural Archives in Brixton, south London – the closest thing we have in this country to a museum to the black British experience – tweeted the names and the photographs of some of them – Mark Duggan, Sheku Bayoh, Sean Rigg, Sarah Reed, Cherry Groce, Leon Briggs, Christopher Alder, Brian Douglas.Yet almost instantly a predictable chorus of voices, emanating from predictable corners of British public life, rose up to dismiss the whole thing as an irrelevance. Using a familiar playbook, they accused those black Britons who see reflections of their own situation in the experiences of African Americans of making false comparisons.The US situation is unique in both its depth and ferocity, they say, so that no parallels can be drawn with the situation in Britain. The smoke-and-mirrors aspect of this argument is that it attempts to focus attention solely on police violence, rather than the racism that inspired it. Those who make it usually point to the ubiquity of firearms in US law enforcement, as proof that the US reality is beyond meaningful comparison. But firearms had nothing to do with the killing of George Floyd. Neither were they a factor in the death of Freddie Gray or the sidewalk killing of Eric Garner, who, like Floyd, pleaded for his life, saying 11 times to the officers who pinned him down: “I can’t breathe”, the same words Floyd used in his final moments. Nor were guns involved in many of the cases when black people have died in custody or during arrest in Britain.To say that the racism that infects parts of our police force and criminal justice system is less virulent than that which poisons the lives of 40 million African Americans is not much of a boast. Is that really the extent of our ambition – to be a somewhat less racist nation than one led by a man who describes white nationalists and members of the Ku Klux Klan as “very fine people”? Surely we who dwell in what the actor Laurence Fox recently assured us is “the most tolerant, lovely country in Europe” have higher hopes?Excusing or downplaying British racism with comparisons to the US is a bad habit with a long history. It began in 1807, with the abolition of the slave trade and picked up steam three decades later with the end of British slavery, twin events that marked the beginning of 200 years of moral posturing and historical amnesia. The Victorian readers who rightly wept over Uncle Tom’s Cabin, for example, conveniently forgot which nation had carried his ancestors into slavery and didn’t dwell on the fact that most of the cotton produced by American slaves like him was shipped to Liverpool.For two centuries, we have deployed American racism as a distraction. It’s as if we find it easier to recognise American forms of racism than we do our own\u0026nbsphome-grown varieties. Convenient, as pointing fingers is always more comforting than looking in the mirror.• David Olusoga is a historian and broadcaster"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f14dd0cad4a0b62f175e2e81285c577c4d7b8d89/0_125_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8041063dc22b3b73bc52041876ac622","title":"this time the promise of change has to be realised black americans have had enough","story":"From the ‘war on drugs’ to the killing of George Floyd, African Americans are too often the victimsIn the middle of a pandemic that is killing inordinate numbers of black people, many have been grieving the lives of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, David McAtee and many others, while living with the realities of Covid-19. That George Floyd lived through coronavirus to then be killed by police who cut off his oxygen is a cruel irony. Yet his death makes it clear that we cannot separate the pandemic from police violence because they are both driven by the same thing – white supremacy.Since the long hot summer of 1967, when more than 150 rebellions ripped across the country, there have been various calls for reform, changes that were supposed to make the lives of black people better. In each instance, those lives have not been improved by these processes and often undelivered promises.\u0026nbspBody cameras, non-lethal weapons, increasing the ersity of police forces and the like were all heralded as changing the face of policing. But they all only changed the techniques. Instead of making officers act more responsibly, we know that body cameras can be turned on and off and cops continue to brutalise the public they purportedly serve.Therefore, reforming a clearly broken system will not do much to keep black people from dying in the streets. In the last week or so, people have continued to be brutalised and killed by police while protesting against that very thing – police violence.\u0026nbspThis pain people are witnessing now occurs in so many facets of black lives, but we don’t see black stories as part of the collective narrative of the US. While the racism that black bodies are made to endure might seem localised, the marginalisation, expulsion and exclusion black people experience have consequences for other communities.\u0026nbspThe “war on drugs”, launched under Richard Nixon, was escalated in the mid-1980s to address the so-called crack epidemic. In very short order, crack cocaine became linked to “urban” crime. The racialisation of the drug made black people the face of addiction and led to calls for more severe punishment for possession of crack. As a result of moral panics over “crack babies” and other such nonsense, we saw harsher punishment for crack versus powder cocaine possession and calls for mandatory minimum sentences that increased incarceration rates for black people.It was not until the opioid epidemic hit rural and suburban white America that cries to see drug addiction as an “illness” were heeded. Some who saw the ravages of opioid addiction were calling for drug treatment, rather than the prison cell they advocated for others. In short, the drugs that had claimed so many black lives came for white people – with different responses.\u0026nbspAnd yet here we are again. Right now in the US, Senator Rand Paul is obstructing the passage of a bill that would make lynching a federal crime after more than a century of advocacy. The journalist and activist Ida B Wells-Barnett described lynching in 1909 as a “colour line-murder” and, most importantly, “a national crime and requires a national remedy”. She said what too few in Congress appreciate today – the death of black people by legal and extra-legal means is “a blight upon our nation”.More than a century later, black people still cannot get the US government to recognise our pains. The reason George Floyd and so many others are dead is because they are black. And being black in my country is treated, by some police officers and vigilantes alike, as probable cause to harass, detain and kill.Consider black people as canaries in the coal mine. What happens to them in this country matters for everyone. Those who would seek to raise the canard of black on black crime as a riposte to the charges of systemic racism in this country have not been paying attention. And focusing on the deaths of those harmed at the hands of the police ignores the many violences black people experience on a daily basis in the US. Forget the term “micro-aggressions” – let’s call them “macroaggressive”. It’s probably not going to be the Knight Rider at your door, but maybe the other “good” white people who come armed with guns demanding to search your home.Yet black people are made to feel ashamed for saying they have been victims. To be a victim simply means that you have been harmed by the actions of another. Yet black people have been told over and over again that the mere mention of racism is unfair. They’re playing the “race card” or adopting a loser’s mentality.That’s a myth we tell so that black people don’t dwell on the many ways they have been damaged. This is not unique to the US. But acknowledging black pain, our pain, is seen as some sort of weakness or loss of control rather than one of the things we must confront if we are to imagine ways to repair these harms.I don’t want black people to simply survive this moment - I want them to thrive. So far, we have been surviving and it’s not served black people well and it’s certainly not served my country well.\u0026nbspThe US needs robust, systemic change and we will not get there by pretending we have not been building up to this moment as long as we have been a country.\u0026nbspIt is a nation founded on theft and it’s payback time. It is always the right time to do the right thing.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02543f7a24d341a74573ba7239b3f8b189aca7c1/40_0_1217_730/master/1217.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86ae1f52613b6b0567e0a98b3793dc97","title":"days of the bagnold summer review bittersweet tale of family strife","story":"Simon Bird’s debut feature captures the comedy and tragedy in the lives of a single mother and her stroppy teenage sonLockdown has done strange things to families. Some have been stretched to breaking point by lengthy periods of communal incarceration others have been brought together, reforging bonds that may have been broken. In Days of the Bagnold Summer, a bittersweet coming-of-age tale (for both of its central characters), mother and son Sue and Daniel aren’t actually in lockdown but they might as well be. Forced to spend several weeks getting under each other’s feet, theirs is a tale of isolation and social distancing that has nothing to do with Covid-19 but still strikes a timely chord.Monica Dolan is terrific as Sue Bagnold, the put-upon yet quietly indomitable fiftysomething librarian whose feckless former husband is now swanning around the States with his pregnant new partner. Lank-haired metal fan Daniel (rising star Earl Cave, seen recently in True History of the Kelly Gang) had been preparing to spend the summer in Florida with his dad, to whose many failings he remains wilfully oblivious. So when, inevitably, Dad lets Daniel down at the last moment, Sue is left facing a six-week sulkathon from her surly and perennially pissed-off son. “It’s not my fault you’re the most boring person in the world!” snaps Daniel, who blames his mother for everything – from passing comment on the lyrics of Metallica (“it’s poetry!”) to agreeing to go on a date with his history teacher, Mr Porter (Rob Brydon, oozing smarm).Despite replacing the sketchy, monochrome squares of the graphic novel with colourful, widescreen images, Bird and cinematographer Simon Tindall are careful to retain a sense of lonely intimacy, with still or slow-moving cameras creating a visual framework that somehow combines the epic within the everyday. In one sublimely tragicomic sequence (bizarrely reminiscent of an infamous scene from A Clockwork Orange), Sue is seen whizzing at high speed around the kitchen, performing endless chores while Daniel sits utterly still, unmoved and unhelping, as if the two are literally living in the same house but in different time zones. Elsewhere, suburban streets and shopping centres are lent an almost western scope, while the vast blue skies of a beach trip provide an ironic backdrop to a scene of chilly confrontation between this odd couple.There are, of course, other characters in this story, ranging from Sue’s more outgoing sister Carol, played with a smidgen of acerbic sass by Alice Lowe to Tamsin Greig as Astrid, the hippy-dippy mother of Daniel’s best friend, who manages to get under Sue’s skin. But despite everything that goes on around them – whether its Daniel’s hilarious attempts to join a local death-metal band (a subplot with a lovely pay-off) or Sue’s misadventures with Mr Porter – it’s the mismatched mother and son who hold our attention at all times. Winterhart’s novel may open with the declaration that “When someone looks back and writes a history of this summer, two people they will almost certainly leave out are Sue and Daniel Bagnold”, yet Bird finds something great in their sidelined lives – whether it’s yearning and loss, or love and laughter. The frost between these two starts to thaw, but as they both grow into different people, the warmth we share feels neither contrived nor sentimental.Some of that warmth comes from the music. Daniel may blot out the world with the wail of angry guitars, but it’s the whimsical tunes of Belle and Sebastian that dominate the soundtrack, a melancholy accompaniment that matches the lo-fi scratchiness of the original illustrations. Plaudits, too, to costume designer Alison McLaughlin, who follows Winterhart’s lead by dressing Sue and Daniel, respectively, in woollen jumpers and baggy all-black fatigues that accentuate just how out of place they are in a world in which the sun is shining. Interlocking vignettes swing from laugh-out-loud comedy to piercing melancholia, but at the centre of it all there is a genuine sense of rebirth and renewal – no mean feat for a small movie with a big heart and a surprisingly wide-ranging vision.

Minorities in the UK,\u0026nbspUS and elsewhere are known to generally experience higher levels of air pollution, and there is growing evidence around the world linking exposure to dirty air exposure to increased coronavirus infections and deaths.Scientists said air pollution should “absolutely” be considered and that it could have a double effect, with long-term exposure weakening lungs and hearts and short-term exposure potentially making viral infection more likely. Before the pandemic, air pollution was estimated to cause 40,000 early deaths a year in the UK, about the same number as the official UK coronavirus death toll to date.“I find it astonishing that they didn’t look at air pollution,” said Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, a World Health Organization advocate for health and air quality. Her daughter Ella died in 2013 from a severe asthma attack that medical experts have now linked to spikes in air pollution.“Air pollution is linked to diabetes, strokes, heart attacks, asthma attacks, and those with underlying health conditions are dying more from Covid-19,” she said. “So I expected the black and minority ethnic community to come out worse, because health inequalities are worst in the BAME community, let alone adding a lethal respiratory virus.“Some people will say air pollution in itself is racism because, yet again, it disproportionately affects black people – Covid-19 has just made it more obvious.” The PHE report was heavily criticised for a lack of recommendations on how to reduce the disproportionate impact among people from ethnic minorities and for removing a section detailing responses from third parties, many of whom highlighted structural racism. On Thursday the equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, rejected claims that “systemic injustice” was the reason for the disparities. Scientists say it is unlikely that any genetic factors play a major role.Badenoch said it was clear “that much more needs to be done to understand the key drivers of the disparities”, and said PHE did not make recommendations because the data needed was not available. On Friday the Equality and Human Rights Commission said it would carry out an in-depth analysis and develop urgent recommendations to address the loss of lives of people from ethnic minorities.A PHE spokeswoman said: “The review looked at factors including age, sex, geography, ethnicity, occupation and deprivation. These were set out in the terms of reference for the work. To further understand the disparities, PHE’s work will be complemented by studies to be undertaken in response to a research call.”Winston Morgan, a toxicologist and clinical biochemist at the University of East London, said: “The fact that we can map death rates from Covid-19 on to almost all other negative societal outcomes is all the evidence we need to know the main problem is with structural racism.\u0026nbsp“A simple genetic cause linked to race does not make scientific sense. The data shows the affected groups transcend the classical definitions of both race and ethnicity. That is not to say when we examine all the data in the future we will not find a very tiny sub-population with a mutation which makes them more susceptible. But many find it easier to use race rather than racism as an explanation, partly because you can link it to something inherent in the victims.”Dominici said: “I really doubt that genetic factors play a bigger role than environmental and societal factors and racism.”Issy Bray, a health statistics expert at the University of the West of England, said: “We cannot rule it out, as other diseases do affect certain ethnic groups for genetic reasons, eg sickle cell anaemia. However, it is already clear that the relationship between ethnicity and risk of coronavirus is at least partially explained by a range of societal factors, and it is these inequalities that we should be tackling.”The scientists said the influence of air pollution could be singled out if carefully analysed alongside other important factors such as population density, deprivation, occupation and obesity, ideally using data on iniduals. Bray said smartphone apps that monitor symptoms could be useful by providing large amounts of personal and location data."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/360f13cb0dfddd0cc9df74677dfe8686e83eec00/241_1570_4111_2465/master/4111.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=660eb21266e66f4fc2416f3828b0db82","title":"razor sharp and revolutionary gordon bankss historic save at 50","story":"The England legend, with one flick of his right hand, mystified Pelé a half-century ago and glamourised his craft from then onPerfection means different things to different people. To some, its pursuit invests life with rich meaning, nobility even, while others merely see a misery-inducing, distinctly Sisyphean, obsession.Most regard it as subjective but, just occasionally, the rarest of moments offer an objective definition. Fifty years ago on Sunday Gordon Banks’s split second of sheer brilliance melded flawlessness, completeness and excellence in one single gravity-defying save from Pelé.It came on a sun-baked day in the western Mexican city of Guadalajara – the “home” of tequila and mariachi music – during the group stage of the 1970 World Cup. A pace-suffused Brazil beat England 1-0 courtesy of Jairzinho’s winner but the scoreline did not provide the game’s abiding memory.Archive television footage shows a threadbare pitch and a blonde Englishwoman in the crowd wearing an extraordinary nose guard, presumably to offer protection from the unforgiving UV rays.Then the camera switches to Pelé arching his back. It captures his neck muscles flexing as he unleashes the most powerful of goal-bound headers only for Banks to make a mockery of the rules governing physics and human physiology.By twisting with incredible rapidity in mid-air and extending the fingers of his right hand to scoop the ball from behind, before somehow flicking it upwards, around the goal frame and away for a corner, he elevated goalkeeping to an art form. It may not have been the finest save in football history but it is arguably the most memorable.As Pelé’s forehead connected with Jairzinho’s looping cross the Brazilian screamed: “Gol.” Instead a glorious collision of physical speed, alacrity of thought and acrobatic reach ensured England’s goalkeeper propelled himself across his goalmouth to produce one of the standout sporting moments of the 20th century.Banks, who died in 2019 aged 81, was already revered for his part in England’s 1966 World Cup triumph and would, later, confound medical opinion by starring for Fort Lauderdale Strikers in the USA despite having lost sight in an eye following a car crash. But Guadalajara eclipsed everything.At the time everyone was so preoccupied with defending the ensuing corner that the goalkeeper received a rather perfunctory head pat from Alan Mullery and a hair ruffle followed by a bottom pat from Bobby Moore. “You’re getting old, Banksy,” said England’s captain. “You used to hold on to them.”In contrast, Pelé – the undoubted star of a truly fabulous Brazil side – never underestimated Banks’s almost incomprehensibly razor-sharp reflexes.“I hit that header exactly where I wanted it and I was ready to celebrate,” he recalled following the death of his one-time nemesis and, later, good friend. “But then Banks appeared in my sight, like a kind of blue phantom. He came from nowhere and he did something I didn’t feel possible. He pushed my header, somehow, up and over. I couldn’t believe what I saw. I can’t believe how he moved so far, so fast.”That stop would become a lodestar for future cohorts of young goalkeepers, transcending generations. Football, by then around a century old, had always been punctuated by seemingly impossible saves but this was different. It came against the Brazilian hyped, deservedly, as the planet’s best player, in front of an international audience relishing the first World Cup to be televised in colour. Nations were mesmerised by a clash of two of the game’s historic heavyweights.When Carlos Alberto’s wonderful pass with the outside of a boot picked out Jairzinho and the winger accelerated inside Terry Cooper in an irresistible blur of yellow, Pelé rose above all comers, appearing somehow to be suspended in mid-air as he anticipated the cross.Little did he know that Banks, decked in royal blue, was about to complete the work begun by the outstanding, ground-breaking Russian goalkeeper Lev Yashin in revolutionising perceptions of their craft. No matter that, after England’s goalkeeper was sidelined by food poisoning, Sir Alf Ramsey’s side lost the quarter-final against West Germany, goalkeeping had been glamourised.“People always ask me about that save,” Pelé reflected. “Yet while it was indeed phenomenal, my memory of Gordon is defined by his friendship. He was a kind and warm man who gave so much. I’m glad he saved my header it was the start of a friendship I’ll always treasure.”In 2003 Banks offered Observer Sport Monthly a detailed account of events after the ball bounced down hard into the ground two yards in front of the goalline on a seemingly inexorable journey towards the top corner. “That save was the best I ever made but, to start with, I didn’t even realise I’d made it at all,” he said. “I heard Pelé shout ‘goal’ followed by a massive, almost deafening, roar. Even though I’d got a hand to it, I thought he must have scored.“Then I realised the crowd were cheering for me. Bobby Moore ruffled my hair. I couldn’t believe it. But it was still 0-0 and we had a corner to defend. As I got to my feet I tried to look as nonchalant as possible, as if to say: ‘I make that sort of save all the time.’“That Brazil team is the greatest to ever play the game and not a day goes by when I don’t get asked about it. I was positioned at the near post, a yard off my line, anticipating the cross. Bobby Moore moved to cover for Cooper, which left Tostão unmarked and Rivelino at the far post. Jairzinho ignored them both, imagine that, and picked out Pelé, who was racing into the box. As he rose to head the ball I started moving across my line. This was where my training paid off.”The idea that sports science is a 21st-century innovation is debunked by the meticulousness of preparations which ensured Banks prevented the ball rebounding conveniently for Pelé to score from a potential rebound. “I’d worked hard prior to the 1970 World Cup,” he said. “The heat and humidity in Mexico meant the ball moved around in the air and the pitches were extremely hard, so any ball bouncing in front of you was nasty.“I knew his header was going to bounce quite high, so I not only flung myself down but slightly backwards. I managed to get my fingertips to the ball and it went straight up into the air and over the bar.”That redefinition of perfection helped ensure Banks became a six times recipient of Fifa’s goalkeeper of the year award but his club career was spent in the less starry environs of Chesterfield, Leicester and Stoke. The 1972 League Cup lifted at Stoke represented his sole domestic prize.Nonetheless, his seemed a charmed life. Fragility never seemed remotely part of Banks’s personal equation until October 1972 when his Ford Consul collided head-on with a van at a sharp bend following afternoon physiotherapy on a shoulder injury. Blinded in one eye, he retired the following summer only to subsequently make that incredible comeback with Fort Lauderdale. As Pelé put it: “Gordon had magic hands.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35086edba7aaef1c645667518eb140b80aff2b87/0_35_2127_1276/master/2127.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce1118859a56987ac05f78aed4201aba","title":"werder bremen v wolfsburg bundesliga live","story":"Wout Weghorst’s late header gave Wolfsburg an important victory in their push for the Europa League - and moved Werder closer to relegationPeep peep!

The relentless Mbabu moved forward and played a good pass down the right to the substitute Klaus. He concentrated furiously on a curling cross to the near post, where Weghorst got away from his man and flicked an accomplished header past Pavlenka.81 min: Schlager hits the bar! That was a fine effort. Arnold’s free-kick from the right led to a couple of blocked shots in the area.

We’ve never needed nature’s salve more. So, for anyone lucky enough to have a garden, now’s the time to treat your backyard with the same decorative care as your front room. We asked five decorators and designers to share their tricks for creating the ultimate outdoor retreat, from furniture to table settings.“If you do it well, a garden is an escape into another little world,” says Beata Heuman. The Sweden-born interior designer, whose own London plot features a conservatory-style garden house, suggests adding a simple string of filament-bulb lights outdoors. “It’s so atmospheric,” she says. “At night, it really heightens the sense of space.”Heuman treats the garden like a room. “Think about how you want to use it throughout the day,” she says. Consider whether you’ll need to provide shade, or if you want to face the sun. With furniture, Heuman errs on the side of caution. “It can be quite sad looking out on lots of empty chairs in winter,” she says. “But a garden bench looks nice all year round.”Inspired by the wall tattoos at Jean Cocteau’s French Riviera home, Heuman has plans for a terrace mural in her own garden. “It gives depth and a sense of something to discover,” she says. Her holy horticultural grail is the Sicilian poolside in Luca Guadagnino’s 2016 film A Bigger Splash. “People aren’t imaginative about gardens,” she says, “but it’s a great place in which to be creative.” beataheumanFor Atelier Vime founders Anthony Watson and Benoît Rauzy, outdoor living can be organised into a trio of spaces: somewhere to dine, somewhere to read and a place to lie in the sun. The pair have been spending their days on their farm in Brittany, where they’re growing their first crop of wicker, the base material for their creations. “Garden reading is an activity that requires a comfortable chair and a low table for your book, carafe and glass,” says Rauzy. “I’m a big fan of the outdoor bookshelf – ideally somewhere sheltered from the rain.”For outdoor flooring they love scourtin, the circular rugs made out of coconut fibre that were once used as extraction filters in the production of olive oil. Made in La Scourtinerie, a small factory in Provence, the rugs are “so sweet underfoot”, says Rauzy.Watson and Rauzy dine at a round rattan 1960s table topped with tiles by the French ceramicist Roger Capron. They’ll arrange large rattan armchairs and sunbeds together with giant planters and lanterns of their own design. The key to the outdoor idyll is practicality. “Everything has to be easy to live with,” says Rauzy, “so less is definitely more.” ateliervimeenSimplicity is the essence of Nathalie Farman-Farma’s garden style. The textile designer’s terrace on the roof of her London studio draws on the botanical aesthetic of traditional Russian dachas (cottages). “Nothing should compete with nature,” she says of the richly layered tapestry of vegetables, herbs and climbers in terracotta pots. The most important addition is her white wooden café table with foldable chairs. But the style should be dictated by the context, she says. She’ll use vintage scarves, or antique folk textiles as a tablecloth, topped with small Japanese ikebana basket planters. “I love things to feel a little overgrown,” she says of her rooftop’s romantic, yet unfussy look. For guests she’ll pull out cushions and Bessarabian kilims from indoors. “I like the continuity between the outside and in,” she says. “It’s nice to blur the boundaries.”decorsbarbaresMatilda Goad has turned her modest north London plot into a series of little havens. It’s partitioned both by foliage and flowers, and old railway sleepers found on eBay, to build borders, paths and a bench. “It creates a sense of discovery even in a small space, which is exactly what I like to do indoors,” says designer and consultant Goad, who created the space under the guidance of the garden designer Butter WakefieldRather than splurge on furniture, Goad plans to build a concrete- topped dining space. “We so rarely have amazing weather in this country, it makes sense to think about pieces to pull into the garden from your sitting room,” she says. Long wooden benches and little stools work just as well outside as in, especially when teamed with Hungarian linen cushions and Mexican rugs to pull everything together.“Furniture is a great way to change a garden without altering the whole infrastructure,” says Ula Maria, landscape architect and author of Green: Simple Ideas for Outdoor Spaces. “It’s such a basic thing, but if there’s a chair outside, you’re more likely to go out and sit.” The smaller the space, the bigger the impact. “Furniture can be used as sculpture,” says Maria. She likes online second-hand store 1stdibs for quirky finds. The aim is to create harmony. “Keep to a particular style,” she says. “In a contemporary garden with minimal planting, you’d have clean-lined furniture. But in a more romantic, English garden where the plants are whimsical, go for something vintage or classical.”ulamaria"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/644b62d01974791ab94abde0e3dfb1899ea5b5ba/0_2578_5902_3540/master/5902.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc908312fb412ab514468d1f0e35f94d","title":"doorstep delights why front gardens matter","story":"A place to socialise, an oasis for wildlife, a gift to our neighbours – a front garden can be all of these things. Isn’t it about time we showed them some love,asks Clare CoulsonLast month, with more time at home than usual, Charlotte Harris, one half of the landscape design duo Harris Bugg, decided to dig up her paved front garden in Newham, east London. “It was a discussion we’d been having for a while,” says Harris, who gardens with her girlfriend Catriona Knox. They’d already removed the paving from the back garden of their house, which is in a densely populated area of the city undergoing vast amounts of regeneration. “Around here every bit of green space feels precious,” she says. “Obviously there are parks, but I think each of us has to take responsibility for any space we have.”As you’d expect in a city, the new front garden needs to work hard to accommodate bins, bikes and a composting hot bin, but Harris is determined to plant as much as possible in the rest of the space, including a small tree (on the shortlist are a Sichuan pepper tree, hawthorn or a Chinese fringe tree) underplanted with perennials and bulbs.Over the past couple of months, the front garden has gained a powerful new significance. For many it has become the point of contact – a socially distanced greeting over the garden gate, a conversation with friends or family delivering supplies, or catching up with a neighbour you’d hardly spoken to before. It has become a safe place where you could still engage with the outside world or join in community events, such as clapping for carers. “Front garden spaces are so important,” says Thompson, whose concept was partly inspired by communal spaces in Italy with their clusters of pots and window boxes as well as the famously verdant Bonnington Square, in Vauxhall, south London. “They provide a common interest, a starting point for talking. But it also gives you the chance to be in the presence of people even if you don’t want to talk – just seeing someone is good for you.”Thompson chose plants that were easy and accessible including an exuberant mix of annuals – poppies, nemesia, cornflowers – that can be grown quickly from a £2 packet of seeds, and imagined that her gardens’ owners could leave out their excess flowers or produce – bunches of sweetpeas, punnets of tomatoes or a few courgettes. “That generosity, whether it’s sharing things or just knowledge, is so important,” she says.“More people are walking locally at the moment and they really do appreciate something pretty to look at. It lifts the spirits and changes the whole feel of a house and area,” says designer Alexander Hoyle, who creates gardens for private clients as well as displays for firms such as Hermès and Sibyl Colefax \u0026amp John Fowler. He regularly posts images of his extraordinary flagstoned front garden on Instagram, charting its evolution through the seasons via an assemblage of chunky rattan planters, cast iron window boxes and trees, shrubs and roses. “Outdoor space in cities is at a premium, so why not use all you’ve got?”Similarly, the gardener and writer Arthur Parkinson uses his family’s front garden in Nottinghamshire for a year-round display in dolly tubs and galvanised baths (the shadier back garden is managed by his mum). Earlier this year his tulip extravaganza in rich Venetian colours was such a hit, it had its own segment on Gardeners’ World. “It’s really a defence against these dead zones of paving and Astroturf,” says Parkinson of his exuberant patch that is also a wildlife magnet. “People catch a glimpse of it and smile, and I hope it encourages them to just get pots and grow like mad.” Now that the spring bulbs are finished, he is busy creating a fresh display using snapdragons (the Sonnet series), Helichrysum ‘Dragon Fire’ and ‘Apricot Peach’ as well as sunflowers, dahlias, sweetpeas and the gorgeous cup and saucer vine, Cobaea scandens. In other words a t jungle of colourful planting that gives him a sense of privacy from his close neighbours.Meanwhile in Dorset Road, north London, a Victorian terrace of railway cottages originally built for workers at the nearby Alexandra Palace station, typifies how cottage garden style can work in urban settings. With fragrant herbs and shrubs, climbing roses, honeysuckles and, in some cases, raised beds for veg growing, these picturesque gardens are a soothing, restorative and sometimes productive antidote to city life. They are also great sources of inspiration and in a normal year this row of friends and neighbours would be opening collectively for the National Garden Scheme. This year would have been Dorset Road’s 12th year and they’ve raised almost £15,000 for the NGS’s charitable causes, which include Marie Curie and Macmillan Cancer Support.As the suburbs developed in the 20th century it was labour-intensive bedding plants, such as petunias or exotic cannas and monkey puzzle trees, that were all the rage. “These were gardens where people would demonstrate their wealth, taste and respectability,” adds Davison. In other words, keeping up appearances.But the effects of these cared-for spaces on a sense of pride, community and wellbeing are huge. The RHS is currently trying to quantify the impact of front gardens with a controlled study in which the residents of one Salford terraced street are given money and advice to do up their front gardens. The study will monitor the mood and perceptions of those who pass by, as well as residents.Covering front gardens with impermeable paving or concrete also contributes to flooding hotspots. When there are no borders, hedges and trees to soak up surface water it all drains into a system that was never designed to take such high volumes. In Edinburgh alone, around 11.3 hectares of green land (the equivalent to 15 football pitches) are lost each year, partly from the paving of private gardens. In 2018, researchers at Heriot-Watt university published a report on how valuable front gardens are in controlling surface water run-off and advised that homeowners should be encouraged to de-pave.What is certain is that the lockdown has given many of us time to take a look at the world on our doorsteps, whether we are lucky enough to have our own front garden or simply to look out and admire someone else’s hard work. “When I walk up the path of my neighbours’ garden that’s beautifully planted and green and cool I just think how much better you would feel if you came home to it each evening,” says Charlotte Harris. “What gardens have taught us during this time is how important they are at lifting our spirits and genuinely giving us all pleasure.” Focus on structure Think about evergreen foliage and seasonal interest. If you can only plant a few things into soil, then plant hedging, and add containers with other things in them.\u0026nbspNothing is low maintenance Do you have access to a tap or hose at the front? If not, choose slow-growing, drought-resistant plants, such as aeoniums, grasses, agave, succulents, lavender and rosemary (all of which will work equally well on a sunny balcony).Layer your plants Cover walls in climbers, such as clematis, honeysuckle or vines, add texture with grasses. Take the same approach to window boxes and choose trailing plants that will spread gracefully.Create a focal point Plants with structure – melianthus, euphorbias, ferns, Salix exigua – provide a dynamic backdrop and will work equally well in pots.Choose hard-working trees If you’ve got space, choose a tree for year-round interest. Hawthorn and crab apples offer spring blossom, fruits, autumn colour and stay a good size or can be pruned into a desired shape.

A groundbreaking TV series on the treasures of Persia, and – if her mum has her way – a crack at BollywoodA little over a decade later, Ahmed won one of the few coveted golden tickets as a graduate trainee in the BBC newsroom. She became a reporter on the Today programme (alongside a youthful Michael Gove) and then on Newsnight, before going on to present Night Waves, The World Tonight and, currently, Front Row. It has only perhaps been in the past year, however, that she has written a brand-new chapter in BBC history of her own.\u0026nbspThat chapter will tell future generations of the story of her successful fight to bring to light the gross inequalities in pay at the corporation between men and women. Last October, Ahmed took her employer of 30 years to a tribunal to challenge that long-standing injustice. To read the judgment in that case is to reflect on the ingrained absurdity of our ideas about “star quality”, and how media “personalities” are created. Pointedly, the case rested on two programmes in which the BBC’s values were held up to public scrutiny: Points of View, presented by Jeremy Vine, and Newswatch, presented by Ahmed. Vine – who then drew a £700,000 salary from the corporation –\u0026nbspreceived £3,000 per episode for his show. Ahmed was paid £440 for, as she said, “doing very similar work”.A main plank of the BBC lawyers’ expensive case against her was that the enormous discrepancy was explained by Vine having “a glint in the eye” and being “cheeky”. The judge in the case was not convinced. “Jeremy Vine read the script from the autocue,” the judgment noted. “If it told him to roll his eyes he did. It did not require any particular skill or experience to do that.”Ahmed won an undisclosed six-figure settlement from the BBC – she had claimed £700,000 in “lost” earnings over many years –\u0026nbspas well as costs. After the tribunal she briefly put her victory in context. “I’d like to thank my union, the NUJ… and I’d especially like to thank the Ford Dagenham women and the women of the Grunwick factory strike who fought for equal pay going back to the 1960s and 70s. I’m now really looking forward to continuing to do my job, to report on stories and not being one.”We talked by Zoom last week. Her family lockdown has involved Ahmed and her husband sharing their Wimbledon home with their two children, 18 and 20, and an American university friend who was stranded. Her visits to Broadcasting House have been restricted to a weekly recording for Front Row frustratingly, given the heightened attention to the politics of news-gathering through the pandemic, Newswatch has been a victim of reduced staffing.\u0026nbspWe talked first about Art of Persia – three years (or a thousand) in the making. Like me, Ahmed has only just seen the final edit of the series and is thrilled by it.\u0026nbspShe first visited Iran for Channel 4 in 2002, for a programme on feminism in Islam, and had always wanted to return. The chance came in 2015 when the BBC first asked her to front this series it eventually took two years to negotiate visas before she and the crew were allowed in last year, on two extensive journeys.\u0026nbspThey were granted some remarkable access to cultural objects and sites that had been off-limits to western cameras since the 1979 revolution. Some, like the original manuscript of the Shahnameh – the priceless 10th-century Book of Kings that provides the narrative for part of Ahmed’s journey – have never been viewed in this way before.Though tensions were high in Iran during the second of Ahmed’s visits, after an American surveillance drone was shot down last June over the Strait of Hormuz, a BBC camera drone was nevertheless allowed to film over extraordinary desert cities like Yazd, where Ahmed met the original Zoroastrians and toured a bazaar largely unchanged since Marco Polo visited. Only once or twice did they brush up against the secret police of the Revolutionary Guards mostly they were at liberty to capture that resilient poetic underground spirit of Persian culture, which has always been at odds with fundamentalist Shi’ism.\u0026nbsp“People would come up and talk to me at sites, and say, ‘We would like to apologise to you for our government,’” she says of the great warmth of welcome they received from ordinary Iranians wherever they went. “I’m very wary of making comparisons,” she says, “but I did find myself thinking a few times of East Germany before the wall came down.”\u0026nbspWatching the ease and curiosity with which Ahmed uncovers this history, always letting the present of Iran filter into her storytelling, you have the sense this is the kind of programme, mixing culture and politics and history, that she has wanted to make ever since her eyes were first opened to the BBC all those years ago.\u0026nbspAhmed was the daughter of parents who shared one of those wonderful London love stories of the 1960s. Her mother had recently arrived in the capital from Lucknow in north India, a Hindu on a bursary from the World Service. Her father was a Pakistani Muslim from Karachi. In the absence of family, they took the bus to the register office for their wedding and celebrated with a meal at an Indian restaurant in Battersea, which they paid for in luncheon vouchers.\u0026nbspAhmed, a frequent contributor to New Humanist magazine, was raised to respect all religions and none. She had an Arabic tutor and learned to read the Qur’an. Her mother used to take her and her sister and brother to the Hindu temple. She went to a Catholic school and, not wanting to be left out, when everyone was doing confirmation classes she did them too. (“I knew it might be the only chance I got to wear a white wedding dress.”) It was a childhood in which nothing felt off limits.\u0026nbspHer dad ran his own business selling catering supplies to Indian and Chinese restaurants her mother, as well as her work for the BBC that included a cookery slot on Pebble Mill at One, was an actor, with credits including Meera Syal’s Bhaji on the Beach. Ahmed is reluctant to suggest that she fulfilled her mother’s ambitions to perform, though she recalls a conversation in which her mum, now 80, sitting in the garden a few years ago, whispered to her: “You know, it’s not too late, we could go to Bollywood and give it a go!”\u0026nbspAhmed’s dreams were much more earnest. In 2015 she cheerfully subjected herself to the cringes of Rufus Hound’s radio series My Teenage Diary, reading from her adolescent journals. Though they contained stray fantasies of meeting David Bowie, and speculation about who shot JR, mostly, aged 15 and 16, she kept up a daily running commentary on the Libyan embassy siege and the miners’ strike. She recalled making her parents switch from the Times to the  after the battle of Wapping, and kept all the back issues as a reference library. It was around this time, she suggested laughing, that she decided there were only two kinds of people: “collaborators and the resistance”.\u0026nbspShe had identified strongly with Laura Ingalls Wilder’s pioneer heroine in Little House on the Prairie, and was “a fiery girl with long plaits”. Her mother insisted she stand up for herself. “The 70s was quite horrible for racism in this country,” she says. “Walking down the street in south London, if some kids shouted some racial abuse at us, my mother always stopped and turned around and gave them this filthy look. She would look at me and say: ‘Don’t ever be afraid of these people.’” Ahmed held on to those principles.\u0026nbspAt the end of her Teenage Diary embarrassments, Hound asked her what her teenage self would have said to her now. She replied without hesitation: “Well, you haven’t sold out, I’m proud of you.”In her podcast interview series, How I Found My Voice – she has interviewed heroes from Gina Miller to Michael Palin – Ahmed proves herself endlessly curious about the choices people have made in becoming successful. After acing her exams at her independent girls’ school she had a front-row seat in how privilege and patronage worked at Oxford. She was a contemporary of Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove. “In my first term people would point out Boris Johnson,” she said, “and suggest that he would one day be prime minister. That idea seemed utterly ridiculous.”\u0026nbspShe recalls editing the Oxford Union magazine when Gove was president. He wrote a bracing editorial, which she has kept, about\u0026nbspelitism. “I cannot overemphasise what elitism is NOT,” he argued. “It is not about back-slapping cliques, reactionary chic or Old Etonian egos. It is a spirit of unashamed glamour, excitement and competition.”She chooses her words with consummate BBC care when I ask her if she is surprised how Gove – “always very charming and extremely clever” – has turned out. “I was very interested to see him describe Dominic Cummings as a man of honesty and integrity,” she says. “I am very much a Generation X-er. I always thought when our turn came to be running things, we would do things right.”\u0026nbspThe reluctant publication of those salary figures of the BBC’s “talent” for the first time in 2017 had a big impact, she says. What senior women at the BBC had suspected just about for ever was now shown to be fact. “I tried to treat my own story as if it was any other story,” she says of her tribunal case, “and approach it as an investigative journalist. I gathered as much evidence as I could, and went through it stage by stage.”To begin with there was a letter to the papers signed by 33 women involved, asking for things to be put right. That group stayed together, sharing information, speaking regularly, involving the union. At least 20 cases around equal pay are pending, not only from headline act presenters but also from editors and producers.\u0026nbspJust how much of a risk those women have taken to get to that stage was outlined in an open letter by Carrie Gracie, the former BBC China editor, who initially resigned in disgust when it was revealed that she was being paid only a little more than half of male counterparts such as Jon Sopel in Washington. Gracie – who later accepted parity and backpay from the BBC after a brutal year of argument – described how women in her privileged but unequal position “have felt trapped. Speaking out carries the risk of disciplinary measures or even dismissal litigation can destroy careers and be financially ruinous. What’s more the BBC often settles cases out of court and demands non-disclosure agreements, a habit unworthy of an organisation committed to truth, and one which does nothing to resolve the systemic problem.”Someone, it was clear, had to break that pattern of ide and rule. Ahmed’s earnings comparison with Jeremy Vine was so stark that it must have looked like the perfect test case…\u0026nbspNow she has come out of the other side of the case, and the long months of preparation for it, it’s almost as if, she says, it happened to someone else. “I can’t pretend that I am not pleased. I used to walk from Waterloo station across the bridge to the tribunal every day, and both during it and after it, people were incredibly supportive, they would come up and say: ‘Good on you!’” After it was over, all sorts of different people got in touch to say how much it meant – from Katie Puckrik to Richard Coles. “The Proclaimers sent me a nice message. And so did Margaret Atwood.”In the course of those months, and despite the BBC lawyers’ efforts to underplay her professional abilities, Ahmed managed to keep any personal anger out of her case. Sometimes, no doubt, that was difficult. When, for example, she heard that inadvertently recorded off-air “banter” between John Humphrys and Jon Sopel about Carrie Gracie’s letter (“Oh dear God,” Humphrys said to Sopel, “she’s actually suggested you should lose money…”) did that sharpen her resolve? She smiles judiciously. “I think what is interesting these days, with social media, is that you can see straight away what everyone else makes of something like that. It didn’t really need me to comment. I would just direct you to read everyone else’s comments.”\u0026nbspIn his interview last month with the outgoing director general of the BBC, Tony Hall, Andrew Marr referenced Ahmed’s case (forgetting her name, before correcting himself) and wondering whether the BBC was now on top of the issue. Hall made all the right noises about transparency.\u0026nbspDoes Ahmed feel that the culture that produced her case has been addressed as she would like it to have?“I can’t say how far that has been sorted yet. But they understand there is an issue it is ongoing.”\u0026nbspShe did, she says, seriously consider at one point applying to be Hall’s successor, but for the time being came to the conclusion that her heart still is in broadcasting – “though maybe next time”.\u0026nbspShe insists that there have been no repercussions professionally from her case against her employer, though it seems slightly odd to me that her Persia series will go out on BBC Four, and not on BBC One or BBC Two, where it would surely have been if, say, Marr or Vine had been granted the access she had been given. Was she disappointed at that?“I did ask,” she says, diplomatically. “And they are trailing the series, so that is a proper bit of investment in it.”\u0026nbspBecause of her long stint on Newswatch, few people understand the labyrinthine internal politics of the BBC quite as clearly as Ahmed. She remains proud that “nowhere else has a programme like Newswatch, which encourages scrutiny and self-criticism – even if people don’t always agree with the answers”. Because the programme is currently off air she has been unable to investigate the story behind the public censure of Emily Maitlis for breaking impartiality rules in her intro about Dominic Cummings for Newsnight – though she will have been as surprised as anyone at the speed of the response from the BBC hierarchy.\u0026nbspAfter a third request, she was informed at the beginning of last week that there might be a way for Newswatch to return soon, though the decision has to go to the BBC news board, “which might take weeks”. In its absence, Ahmed has plenty to be getting on with. The new series of her podcasts began last week with a live interview with Yotam Ottolenghi she is preparing slots with Paloma Faith and Margaret Atwood, who has become something of a champion of her equal pay battles.\u0026nbspAhmed is 51. Historically, I suggest, the BBC has not had a great track record in developing the careers of its female presenters as they move into their 50s and 60s. Is she confident she can become a role model in that respect also?\u0026nbspShe laughs. “I hope so. I have definitely had some conversations lately that have channelled my inner Maggie Smith as Miss Jean Brodie and insisted I am in my prime.” Thinking of her Indian-Pakistani family, as much as her BBC one, Ahmed has long had the sense that one of the archetypes that the broadcaster could do with urgently reinventing is that of the “wise auntie”, spirited and trustworthy in equal measure. It is, perhaps, the role her nine-year-old self, sitting in the gods at Pebble Mill, always instinctively understood.\u0026nbspArt of Persia starts on BBC Four on Monday 15 June.

However, the road to eighth on the bill at an obscure festival is paved with the efforts of bands whose second albums failed to live up to their early promise, and while it is excellent in places, Sideways to New Italy doesn’t quite rise to the same heights as its predecessor.There’s no radical shift in direction: the interwoven lines of their three singer-guitarists still recall the pop magnificence of the Go-Betweens the pulsing rhythms still give their songs a sense of urgency. But the success of Hope Downs – and the relentless touring that resulted – have clearly had an unsettling effect. While each of the opening trio of songs sparkles, most notably The Second of the First, delve further and there’s a growing sense of wistfulness on tracks such as Sunglasses at the Wedding, the outgoing exuberance that defined their earlier songs ebbing away to be replaced by a sense of dislocation and mild ennui. And – crucially – the hooks are slightly less sharp.

The revelation will raise more concerns about the government’s commitment to upholding “high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards”.The note, seen by the Observer and dispatched at the start of last month, gave approval for the US trade talks to go ahead and set out the conditions of engagement. It reveals serious cabinet unrest over the shape of a US deal and appears to suggest UK regulations could be changed to accommodate an agreement. It also makes clear that talks were to be used to “maximise leverage” in trade negotiations with the EU.“Consultation and agreement from relevant colleagues is sought before agreeing to change domestic policy or regulations as part of the negotiations,” it states. “In the context of preserving the integrity of UK domestic law, any decisions taken in sensitive areas … must take into account the potential legal implications for the UK and be agreed by the relevant ministers.”The memo reveals how contentious the US trade talks are regarded as being within the cabinet. Issues were raised by 11 cabinet ministers, including health secretary Matt Hancock, environment secretary George Eustice and Mark Spencer, the chief whip.“Written responses were received from the health secretary, foreign secretary, the chief whip, the business secretary, the environment secretary, the chancellor of the exchequer, the justice secretary, the defence secretary, the culture secretary, the Welsh secretary and the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,” it states. “All other members of the committee were content.”The briefing also states that a cabinet committee would return to the animal welfare issue “in June to settle all outstanding agriculture issues”, suggesting an unresolved split. Meanwhile, it demands that “ministers receive regular progress reports of concurrent EU and US negotiations to help maximise leverage and allow policy tensions to be resolved as they emerge”.A government spokesperson said that it had been “very clear since the outset that we will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards”.Campaigners want legal guarantees on those standards to be enshrined in an agriculture bill currently being debated in parliament. The issue has already prompted a Tory rebellion in the Commons.It comes after reports last week that the government was proposing a “dual scheme” that would see higher tariffs on US foods with lower animal welfare standards. It is not clear whether higher tariffs would also be linked to environmental standards.Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesperson, said: “People can now see that promises made by Johnson and Gove were worthless.”Luke Pollard, the shadow environment secretary, said: “It is unacceptable for the government to allow our high food standards to be compromised and our farmers undercut in any future trade deals. Attempts by ministers to use tariffs and tax rates to get around their manifesto commitment on food standards won’t wash.”Nick von Westenholz, director of EU exit and international trade for the National Farmers Union, said: “The government made a manifesto commitment not to compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards in trade negotiations, and this commitment is explicitly stated in the government’s specific objectives for the US negotiations. We would expect UK trade negotiators to be rigorous in upholding these commitments.”A government spokesman said: “We will always stand up for British farming and are determined to use trade negotiations to secure new opportunities for farmers.“Having left the EU, we will get to decide how we set and maintain our own laws, standards and regulations, upholding our food, environmental and animal welfare standards. Our food regulators will continue to provide independent advice to ensure that all food imports into the UK comply with those standards.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e445cba32b31ab6eac9fe56a73d904fd82f4e362/0_88_4897_2938/master/4897.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e7e7e5701bdad581e6318d7cdf895b5e","title":"uk coronavirus live matt hancock health chiefs debate lockdown easing covid 19 latest updates","story":"Senior NHS figures warn Boris Johnson to plan for second wave infection rate could be increasing in some areas, including north-west EnglandScottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has warned that “we can’t read too much into a single day’s figures” after Scotland reported no deaths for the first time since lockdown began. “We know registration of deaths are relatively low at weekends,” said Sturgeon.During the Scottish government’s daily press conference, health secretary Jeane Freeman said it was “very likely” that more deaths would be recorded in the next few days.The latest figures, released by the Scottish government on Sunday afternoon, show that a total of 2,415 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, no change on Saturday’s figure.A further 18 people have tested positive for Covid-19, taking the country’s total infections to 15,621.A major teachers’ union is warning local authorities in the north-west of England not to open schools in their areas without taking further precautions, after reports suggest the Covid-19 reproduction R rate in the region has risen above one and authorities in greater Manchester and Lancashire advised their schools not to reopen on Monday.Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, said he has written to local authorities and mayors in Manchester, Oldham, Salford, St Helens, Stockport and Warrington to warn that the increase in the R rate “poses unacceptable risks” to the health and safety of staff and pupils.“Employers have statutory responsibilities to protect the health, safety and welfare of their employees at work and to minimise the risks to which employees are exposed. Given the reports that the R rate has now risen above one in the north-west, meaning that the virus may be growing again, the NASUWT believes these local authorities must fulfil their duty of care to staff and pupils by rethinking plans for the wider reopening of schools in their region.“Some local authorities and employers in the region have already suggested that schools in their borough postpone the wider reopening of schools in response to the increase in the R rate. The NASUWT believes their neighbours should now do likewise,” Roach said.“In the absence of new risk assessments being provided to the NASUWT and in the light of the increase in the R rate, the union must insist that these local authorities demonstrate how they intend to keep pupils and staff safe and if they cannot, they must pause their plans for the wider reopening of schools.” Blackburn with Darwen council emailed schools on Friday evening, advising them not to reopen on Monday, while officials in Tameside, greater Manchester, advised schools to delay reopening until 22 June other than for vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers .Steve Rotherham, the Liverpool city mayor, tweetedon Sundaythat the rise of the R rate “is a worrying development. It is a warning sign that must be taken seriously.”Similarly, no new coronavirus deaths have been reported in Northern Ireland.Total deaths of those who tested positive for the virus in the country stands at 537, according to the Department of Health. There have been another six confirmed cases of Covid-19, bringing the total recorded since the outbreak began to 4,796.No new coronavirus deaths have been reported in Scotland for the first time since lockdown began, Scottish government figures show. A huge gathering is taking place outside the US embassy in South London as anti-racism protests continue across the UK.Peaceful demonstrators – the majority of whom are wearing face coverings – are taking part in chants including “no justice, no peace” while the road leading to the embassy in Nine Elms has been closed off.In Bristol, Black Lives Matter protestors have covered the city’s controversial statue of slave trader Edward Colston with black fabric. British Airways has started legal proceedings against the government in its bid to overturn quarantine rules due to take effect in the UK from Monday.BA’s owner IAG has sent a pre-action protocol letter setting out why it believes the moves, which will force air passengers arriving from abroad to self-isolate for 14 days, are illogical and unfair.Airlines and travel firms have protested in vain against the new Home Office-led regulations, which they have said come months late to stop the transmission of coronavirus and will kill off any nascent recovery in their industries.You can read the full report from our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham here:The government have announced a new support package for British overseas territories during the pandemic. It includes repurposed military oxygen machines and funding for testing facilities and will be available across 14 overseas territories.A 247 hotline to connect medics in the territories with global health experts will also be established.“In times of crisis, the UK family always stands together and our package of support for the overseas territories not only benefits communities in the fight against coronavirus, but also in the long term,” said overseas territories minister Baroness Sugg. “Whether that is helping them test for viruses, such as Zika and dengue, or supplying critical medical equipment to provide life-saving support to British people who live in some of the most remote locations in the world.”Previously, tests had to be shipped overseas from territories including the Falkland Islands and Anguilla to be processed, including to the UK. It is hoped the new testing machines and extra medical equipment will enable health services to receive same-day results.The method of voting in the House of Commons last week resembled a “Gilbert and Sullivan farce rather than serious Westminster processes”, Dame Margaret Hodge has said. Her comments come after MPs joined a 90-minute queue on Tuesday to vote to prevent the resumption of virtual voting. The senior Labour backbencher told Sky News’ Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “So tomorrow there is a debate on virtual access and I would like to virtually take part in that debate. I’ve been told I can’t do that so I am being disenfranchised and discriminated against in a debate which is discussing my disenfranchisement and my discrimination. It’s just a nonsense.” The Barking MP, 75, is currently shielding as she is in the age group that is most at risk from Covid-19. Thousands of people have also gathered for an anti-racism protest under Arthur’s Seat in Edinburgh. Our Scotland editor, Severin Carrell, is on the scene speaking to demonstrators.Continued demonstrations are underway after the health secretary Matt Hancock said there is undoubtedly a risk there will be an increase in coronavirus cases as a result of the mass gatherings. I’m Amy Walker, back from lunch, and ready to guide you through the afternoon’s UK coronavirus updates. There are more Black Lives Matter protests today and at least one is already under way in Nottingham.Here’s a roundup of the key UK coronavirus developments from this morning. That’s it from me, Amy Walker, for a short while. I’ll be handing over to my colleague Haroon Siddique during lunchtime. The failure to consider air pollution as a factor in the higher rates of coronavirus deaths among minority ethnic groups is “astonishing” and “wholly irresponsible”, according to critics of a Public Health England review.The PHE report released on Tuesday confirmed the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on people from ethnic minorities but did not mention air pollution. Minorities in the UK, US and elsewhere are known to generally experience higher levels of air pollution, and there is growing evidence around the world linking exposure to dirty air exposure to increased coronavirus infections and deaths.Scientists said air pollution should “absolutely” be considered and that it could have a double effect, with long-term exposure weakening lungs and hearts and short-term exposure potentially making viral infection more likely.You can read the full report from our environment editor, Damian Carrington, here:Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has cautioned that “Covid-19 is still a very real threat” and asked people to “consider ways of making your voice heard that doesn’t put yourself and others at risk” ahead of an anti-racism protest in the capital this afternoon. Londoners of all ages, races and backgrounds joined millions of people around the world yesterday to come together peacefully. I stand with you. George Floyd’s brutal killing must lead to immediate and lasting change everywhere.“The vast majority of protesters in London were peaceful. But this vital cause was badly let down by a tiny minority who turned violent. This is simply not acceptable, will not be tolerated and will not win the lasting and necessary change we desperately need to see.”He urged those planning to protest today to “do so safely, peacefully and within the law” as well as to use hand-sanitiser, wear a face covering and to keep 2 metres apart from others. The Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, and the Liverpool city region mayor, Steve Rotheram are holding a joint press conference following a report that suggested the R value had tipped above 1 in the north-west of England. Burnham has said the mayors were not “conducting a blame exercise” but believed the new data was linked to the loosening of lockdown measures. He also reemphasised his call for a regional mayor to sit on Cobra meetings, and said Greater Manchester was not in support of potential localised lockdowns because of the detrimental economic effects. On Friday, the report from scientists at Public Health England (PHE) and the University of Cambridge put R at 1.01 for the north-west and 1 for the south-west. The north-west – including Liverpool and Manchester – is viewed as particularly concerning due to higher numbers of infections there, which would be projected to continue at the current rate.Manchester Evening News’ politics and investigations editor, Jennifer Williams, is posting live updates from the conference.

Events are also scheduled to take place in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Nottingham this afternoon. Earlier, health secretary Matt Hancock said British police were “not like” their American counterparts after thousands of people protested in London yesterday.He told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show: “I think the police did a fantastic job, and I’m very proud of the British police for their professionalism, their restraint in the face of the tiny amount of violence – and I would stress it was a very small amount of violence – later on in the day.“And I think that we can all be proud that the British police are not like the American police in this way and I think that’s a very good thing.”Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy has said the government cannot remain silent on police brutality in the United States. Speaking on the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show, Nandy said she had “no idea whether Donald Trump is a racist or not a racist”, but believed his response to mass protests after the police killing of George Floyd was an “election strategy”.“In the run-up to the American elections, this is one of the ways that politicians try to activate their base,” said Nandy. “They ide people in order to try to advance their own cause and that’s actually one of the things that is so damaging about it.“That’s crept into our politics in Britain in the last few years and we’re seeing under the cover of Covid other countries trying to do something similar – rowing back on people’s freedoms, human rights, the rule of law, democracy.”She added that she supported peaceful protesters against racism and police brutality in the UK, saying that demonstrations were “one of the most important things about living in a free society”.“You cannot be silent in the face of racism and police brutality, and I think those young people are right to raise their voices and to demand change,” said Nandy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/045dd18ccf5de96cbbfb85eca6aed719cfe8512c/0_172_4101_2461/master/4101.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=746570fd09dfbfc24deef11219b5477e","title":"lure of japan ever stronger anxious premiership rugy union players","story":"With clubs in crisis in England and the game booming in the Far East, the current trickle of exports may become more of a floodAfter England’s last match, back in March, Eddie Jones was asked to say a few words about George Kruis, whose impending move to Japan would bring a halt to his international career. “Well, just because he goes to Japan doesn’t mean he can’t play for England,” said Jones, with a trademark mischievous smile.Pressed on what he meant, given Rugby Football Union regulations mean he cannot pick players based outside England, Jones added: “But there’s a special exception.” In reality, he is not going to pick Kruis while he plays for Panasonic Wild Knights and, in hindsight, maybe Jones was hinting at the now doomed plan for Maro Itoje to go to France on loan and still be available for his country. Nonetheless, it was a marked change in attitude from Jones, who in the past, say when Chris Ashton was in such prolific form for Toulon, would simply state: “He’s not eligible for selection.” It spoke of an awareness, too, that the RFU’s strict policy may feel the strain again as the allure of playing in Japan grows. He would know having helped to facilitate a move for Ben Te’o.Daren O’Leary, the former Harlequins wing and now a leading agent, believes Japan now rivals France as the go-to destination for players seeking to sample life abroad. Even before the coronavirus pandemic threw Premiership clubs into financial turmoil, the appeal of playing in Japan was on the rise. The former Gloucester lock Tom Savage, at the end of his first, albeit curtailed, season with Suntory Sungoliath, has only words of encouragement for other players weighing up the move. “Guys like the idea, if you’ve played a long time in England, that it’s a life experience as well,” he says. “You go from getting the bus to the same 12, 13 grounds for a long time and all of a sudden you’re getting the bullet train to matches. It’s refreshing. If you are fortunate enough to get the opportunity, if you do your research, I say: ‘Definitely explore it, give it a go.’”After a brief stint for a cup competition in Japan last June, Savage properly arrived at the Sungoliaths just as World Cup fever was taking hold. With England and Wales reaching the final and semi-final respectively, he believes there has been a willingness from Japanese teams to look beyond Super Rugby and towards Europe for imports. In addition, the zeal with which Japan hosted the tournament – Kruis says: “I really fell in love with Japan during the World Cup” – has heightened the appeal. As O’Leary says: “It suddenly seemed like a far shorter flight to get there.”A move to Japan also offers the chance to bask in the afterglow of a World Cup when they thrilled in reaching the quarter-finals. “The support level has gone through the roof,” says Savage. “The seated tickets at the Tokyo stadium were sold out for the majority of the season. There have been crowds of 45,000 – once the Japanese take a liking to something they buy in.”It also helps that Japanese clubs – because many of them are run as separate arms of large companies – have been less affected by the pandemic, ensuring they can offer stable wages at a time when their English counterparts are in crisis. Put it all together and it is easy to see why it has become such an attractive proposition.Kruis is not alone in heading to Japan next season. Freddie Burns and Alex Goode are on their way, as is Wales’s World Cup centre Hadleigh Parkes. In previous years, Dave Walder, Riki Flutey, James Haskell, Geoff Parling and, more recently, Te’o, have done so. But the trickle is getting stronger. Kruis is perhaps the most significant because he would surely have been picked in Jones’s next squad and it is hard to think of anyone else so settled in the England setup to leave it all behind. Ashton moved to France because he could not get a look-in and though David Strettle did pull out of the wider 2015 World Cup squad because he was joining Clermont he had been ignored for so long he considered his England career over.The RFU will no doubt hope the pull of the jersey remains strong enough to ensure Kruis is an exception, rather than the trailblazer. It did not go unnoticed, however, that New Zealand – ordinarily just as strict in picking overseas players – selected Matt Todd for their last European tour when he was playing in Japan. The argument went that he had already agreed a return to New Zealand, but it is apparent the All Blacks consider Japan the lesser evil compared with England or France when it comes to their players going abroad.“Players and supporters have come back from the World Cup, seen the passion for the sport over there, and realised this is a viable place to go for a life experience as well as a playing one,” says O’Leary.“You do have a short playing career and were salaries to be hit through the pandemic then it’s inevitable you will look to a new opportunity. I don’t think players would go there simply for stability, but it would be one of the major parts, that they can go there, know that their contract is safe, know they are unlikely to see a pay cut in that time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfb230f8b3014d72a8ca2ca473e65951f5303247/0_37_4408_2644/master/4408.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=992a6b24753be7f16d7d32644ac5ff9d","title":"comedy at the covid arms review","story":"Consummate host Kiri Pritchard-McLean sets the stage for Frankie Boyle and others in a show with true comedy-club feel The Covid Arms started life as an online “pub” where a group of friends met during lockdown. Then comedian\u0026nbspKiri Pritchard-McLean\u0026nbspwas invited to perform there, and it became\u0026nbspone of the success stories of pandemic-era comedy. Eleven shows later, it has featured several stellar acts and raised £86,000 for struggling comedians and The Trussell Trust, a food bank charity.You can see why the format took off. It’s the quality of the comics – on Saturday we got Dane Baptiste, Dan Nightingale and Frankie Boyle alongside musician Fran Lobo – and it’s that “front-row” ticket holders (who pay more) get to chat with MC Pritchard-McLean between sets, evoking the club-night vibe. It’s also down to Pritchard-McLean’s compering. She doesn’t just do the links – she stays on screen during the other acts’ sets, giving them someone to play off and cackling at their jokes.It’s an odd role: the visible avatar for a silent, unseen audience. But she plays it without self-consciousness, and it gives the show lift-off. (At other online gigs, the audience silence can be deafening.) Lancashire-born comic Nightingale bounces his whole set off her, and you can’t see the joins between his material – about new fatherhood, lockdown drinking and Mancunians – and the pair’s sparring.Did I see her expression curdle at Baptiste’s questionable gags about “pussy-grabbing”? If so, only a little. Elsewhere, one “crowd-work” section found her negotiating the cancellation of her student loan with a staffer from alma mater Salford Uni. Cut to Glasgow, and a rare flash of the real “francis boyle” (his Zoom handle) behind\u0026nbspthe scorched-earth cynic. The format finds Boyle in an unfamiliar state, halfway between a public performance and a catch-up with a friend. He reads us the first chapter of a novel he’s writing. It’s more literary than his standup, of course. But as its deadbeat hero is grilled by police about a mysterious death, sparks of unmistakable Boyle-ese (one cop shouts “at the volume of a pensioner’s telly”) fly off the text. It ends in Glasgow noir, then – but these Covid Arms gigs look like a real bright spot in lockdown-era comedy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a6adb984edfe832d16464ef1c41675dee05930f/118_134_1168_700/master/1168.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab27cbdab9b8185ce57ed8ec82d06830","title":"the big picture dancing in dublin 1980","story":"Tony Murray’s image, one of a series exploring an Ireland in thrall to the Catholic church, carries a deeper poignancy todayTony Murray’s book Holy Pictures captures the last knockings of an Ireland wholly dominated by the ritual and calendar of the Catholic church.\u0026nbspThis picture was taken in 1980 in Woodtown, Dublin, at a “pattern Sunday” festival for the local patron saint.\u0026nbspThe religious ceremonies at St Colmcille’s Well were followed by displays of traditional music.

In his spare time he took pictures of the country’s festivals and processions, its priests and pilgrims\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspin the mountains of Mayo or the shabbier parts of towns – always with a street photographer’s eye for comic juxtaposition or poignant contradiction. All of the pictures were taken after the visit of John Paul II in 1979, when more than half of the population turned out for a glimpse of the pope, but before the exposure of child abuse scandals that fatally loosened the church’s grip on Irish society.\u0026nbspEven at the time, Murray was anxious that his pictures did not present a romantic or exotic portrait of “rare auld times”. Looking back through them for his book, he said that it was hard to see them now “in a benign way”. Still, the picture of the boy dancing remains a favourite. When he looks at it, Murray can still hear the sound of the well-loved cassette recorder playing through the makeshift PA system as the boy appears to levitate above the stage. “That’s one of the few photographs where I would say that it was important to work quickly,” he suggested recently. “For the majority of images, it demanded that I worked slowly it was about waiting and looking.” • Holy Pictures by Tony Murray is published by Hi Tone Books (€30) "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72013de3cfa3c284e9d6b7d5cbdbcce0dd0cd8e8/0_83_2344_1407/master/2344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cd0b46ee0c5d90e6a435cf4d0cabf27","title":"dinosaur toys and golf clubs the strange things astronauts take to the moon","story":"The personal items that Neil, Buzz and others carried with them – and left up thereBeyond the usual travel essentials, any keepsakes, charms and totems we take with us on our journeys say a lot about our inner worlds. The faithful may carry a crucifix, a rosary or the Qur’an superstitious sailors still carry amulets to ensure a “smooth voyage” soldiers treasure pictures of their sweethearts. Before photography they would carry a lock of their loved one’s hair.\u0026nbspWhen the two crew members of the SpaceX Falcon 9 set off on their historic space journey last week, their totem was a toy dinosaur, taken on the behest of their sons.\u0026nbspDuring the Apollo missions to the moon, the personal items astronauts could take were restricted: each had just a small “personal allowance pouch”.\u0026nbspUnsurprisingly, many chose to take family photographs, though uniquely, on the Apollo 16 mission in 1972, Charles Duke opted to leave his snaps behind on the moon’s surface with a handwritten message for posterity, unaware that solar radiation would eventually bleach him and his family out of existence.When Apollo 11’s Eagle lunar module landed on the moon on 20 July 1969, devout Christian Buzz Aldrin had with him a miniature chalice, wine and bread. Shortly before Neil Armstrong stepped out on to the lunar landscape – and unreported by Nasa – Aldrin requested a moment’s silence and read from the book of John. The first time liquid was poured on the moon was in an act of communion.On the Apollo 14 mission in 1971, Alan Shepard managed to persuade Nasa to let him take a golf club and balls. While he fluffed the first shot, the second may well have been the longest drive in history, thanks to the reduced gravity.Most surprising, perhaps, is a tiny ceramic “wafer” (2cm by 1.3cm) containing six pieces of art transported illicitly on Apollo 12’s lunar module. The work, called Moon Museum, was created by a New York artist, Forrest Myers, who bribed an engineer friend to secrete the item inside one of the lunar module’s legs. It included work by himself and five others – including Andy Warhol, whose image was a neatly doodled penis. As the module remained on the surface, so too does the moon’s first art gallery.\u0026nbspWhen Voyager 1 and 2 set off on their respective journeys deep into the cosmos in 1977, carefully chosen sounds, music and images were left inside. The objects, images and recordings on these twin spacecraft may one day inform other life forms about the ecology, history and culture of our planet.While the totemic objects taken to the moon were deeply personal, their symbolism remains universal, speaking of our need for love, family, art, sex and faith – and our drive for immortality. As for the golf club and dick doodle? Well, they were just men after all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c80339c9cf5b80daeca7946c474c7b1eec071760/0_53_4384_2630/master/4384.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cef1475bb9588e32b724a0616db064af","title":"meet the family how lockdown tv has brought fame to the loved ones of the famous","story":"Some, like Konnie Huq, are old hands and others like Shanthi Ranganathan are learning fast. But all have the same problemsArt mirrors life, but it also works the other way round. Then again, sometimes there is little difference between the two. When David Tennant and Michael Sheen perform on screen together remotely this week, they will be playing the parts of actors who are trying to work from home against the odds. And appearing alongside them in Staged, a new six-part comic drama for BBC One, will be Georgia Tennant, who happens to be married to Tennant, and Anna Lundberg, who is locked down in Wales in real life with her partner, Sheen, and their new baby.The faces of the parents, partners and children of many household names have started to become familiar to viewers. When Chris Packham presented his scaled-down Springwatch on BBC Two this season, he did it alongside his stepdaughter, the wildlife expert Megan McCubbin, while the comedian Romesh Ranganathan has his mother, Shanthi, up there on a screen beside him, the ultimate in reliable sidekicks, on BBC Two’s hit topical show The Ranganation. And last month when Charlie Brooker presented a one-off side-swipe at current affairs on the same channel’s Antiviral Wipe, his wife, Konnie Huq, handily provided a comic domestic cameo or two.In Huq’s case, of course, the camera is no stranger. She began presenting Blue Peter at the age of 22. Georgia Tennant and Lundberg are also accustomed to performing. Lundberg, from Sweden, studied acting in London, and Tennant, as well as bringing up five children with her husband, has a television career. All the same, making Staged has been an exposing experiment.“We wanted it to be as real as possible, but at the same time not too revealing of our own lives,” said Tennant. “After all, we are in our own house, filming it with our children around us. We are opening up before the nation, but you do want to retain something.”Tennant, also one of the producers of the show, was born into acting, since her parents are Sandra Dickinson and Peter Davison, the other former Doctor from Doctor Who in her life. She has appeared on screen with her father before, but this time, opposite her husband, the stakes are higher since she portrays a version of her own life. The plot of Staged, written by Simon Evans and Phin Glynn, revolves around the efforts of the two men, Tennant and Sheen, to rehearse remotely for a West End show during lockdown.“In the first drafts of the script, I was much more supportive,” she explained. “David plays a more pathetic version of himself, and I just thought I would lose patience with him if he was like that. So I decided to play someone not as indulgent.”The strategy also affords some protective distance from the relationship being displayed on screen.“We had to think about what to show of the house. Michael and Anna were much smarter than us though,” said Tennant. “They cleverly set up their camera in one corner of their kitchen. But about a third of our stuff is done on iPhone, so moves all around the place. Some of the footage comes from quite strange places, as we had to find somewhere that wasn’t occupied at that moment.”For other lockdown relatives of the famous, such as McCubbin, a zoolologist, facing a primetime television audience alongside her stepfather from the garden of their Hampshire home required a sudden change of gear. But the two seemed happy to tease each other. McCubbin had not been doing the washing up, Packham suggested. “Come on, you can identify 46 UK ladybirds, but you don’t even know where the saucepan lives,” she parried.Meanwhile, online, a grateful nation has had cause to applaud another handy stand-in. When the YouTube star Joe Wicks hurt his hand and was unable to lead his daily exercise class, it was his wife, Rosie, who stepped up to the plate, with her husband on the sidelines. “I’ve had to call in a supply teacher,” he posted online. “Rosie’s kindly agreed to come on the livestream with me to demonstrate the moves as I really need to let my hand rest for a few days. It’s totally out of her comfort zone, so I have got so much love and respect for her right now.”For Ranganathan’s mother, the learning curve has been approached at a sedate pace. She started working with her errant son on his BBC Three show Asian Provocateur, and now takes pride of place on an acclaimed lockdown adaptation of The Ranganation. Her brand of impromptu motherly disapproval shapes the programme’s appeal, and her son admits she now presents a challenge. “Does it grate slightly when people go on about how naturally funny she is? Yes it does,” he has said. “But she loves it, she loves getting recognised, and I’m happy for her to be successful. Up to a point.”And making the show work from behind the scenes is Debra Blenkinsop, director of operations at the production company Zeppotron. “We treat Shanthi more like one of the other invited star guests,” she explained. Mrs Ranganathan gets makeup tutorials before the shoot and a direct feed from her home into the studio – set up in her son’s garage.“We were helped by the nature of the show, and lucky that Romesh had a garage. You have to make sure the family are happy when you film in their home, and you have to keep neighbours informed too. We let them know when the trucks will be there,” said Blenkinsop, who has speedily become an expert in lockdown production.On Friday, she shared her know-how in an online masterclass staged by ScreenSkills for those making unscripted television. “We set it all up meticulously, with specialist gear and gloves. Even the pizza for the crew has to be delivered to a station where the boxes are sanitised first.”Blenkinsop suspects the family dynamic is essential to the mood of the show. “It is an insight into a tiny facet of the Ranganathans’ lives, but they can choose what we see. It looks incredibly intimate.”Also taking newfound screen fame in her stride is Grayson Perry’s other half, the psychotherapist and writer Philippa Perry. The Turner prize-winning ceramicist has hosted Art Club for Channel 4 from his home studio, and his wife is there to cast an eye and join in with a weekly artistic challenge. Their presentation of home life, so apparently natural, is also a key to the tone of the show. Like The Ranganation, it puts the experiences and reactions of a selection of viewers at its heart, offering something inclusive.“When you are separated from society, you want to emphasise the common ground,” said Georgia Tennant. “You see people on social media home-schooling with perfect hair. And I am not like that, so we left things as they are.“You become quite ‘unvain’, which is good.

We are pleased to see the new railing is allowing wind to flow more smoothly across the bridge.”A headline on the website of local NPR radio station KQED read: “The Golden Gate Bridge Sounds Like a David Lynch Movie Now.” The director is a prominent user of wind sounds in his films.The station reported: “Because it s a very windy gap across the Bay, the Golden Gate Bridge is now effectively a giant orange wheezing kazoo.”Others who posted videos of the novel sound appeared more at ease, however. One described it as “so peaceful”. Another said: “So crazy but also kinda beautiful!!”“We can hear this in our house more than three miles away from the bridge. It’s crazy making,” one user wrote Friday evening.The noise is not the first time a suspension bridge’s physical qualities have raised eyebrows.

You imagined it would involve the usual British excesses of lager and sunshine. In fact, in the past week its primary expression has been a coming together of mostly young people in our cities under the banner of Black Lives Matter.On Saturday, in by far the largest of the week’s demonstrations in London, many thousands crammed shoulder to shoulder in Parliament Square in the blustery rain and edged their way forwards toward St James’s Park. On Friday, police and government ministers had warned that such a crowd was not only unlawful but certainly dangerous with the virus still being transmitted from person to person.In the midst of that crowd – an unnatural human feeling in itself for all those who have been in isolation – it was impossible not to feel that those warnings should have been heeded far more closely. But for the vast majority of those that came, the risk had seemed worth it. Some of the banners in Parliament Square made their argument succinctly: “Racism has always been a pandemic.”As well as looking like the premature end of a shutdown spring in the capital, the protest also felt very much like the beginning of something not a one-off outpouring of rage against the brutal killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis 12 days ago, but a sustainable expression of the need for change.There was an urgency about that demand, as well as a weariness. Innumerable wounds have been opened by the graphic video of Floyd’s death, stretching back in British memories over generations – the protesters’ banners were a roll call of past and current injustice. Actor John Boyega’s heartfelt speech to the demonstrators on Wednesday made those links explicit: “We are a physical representation of our support for\u0026nbspGeorge Floyd … We are a physical representation of our support for Stephen Lawrence.” His words were carried on many of the cardboard signs held aloft: “Now is the time. I ain’t waiting.”That sentiment, which has spread through cities across the world, was never likely to be postponed by demands for physical distancing. The loose network of Black Lives Matter activists who have coordinated last week’s protests across the UK did their best to mitigate the risks in the crowd. They came equipped here with stocks of free masks and sanitiser. Imarn Ayton, 29, one of those coordinators, kicked off proceedings through a loudhailer: “We are not here for violence. If you commit violence today you are not for the cause. I don’t want to see no alcohol. I don’t want to see no weed. This is not a carnival. And keep your distance. You don’t need me to say that coronavirus is killing black people.”For many hours her hopes for a peaceful protest were realised, but\u0026nbspin late afternoon there were clashes between protesters and police and one officer appeared to be knocked off their horse, which then bolted – sending crowds of people scattering.\u0026nbspWhen I spoke to Ayton, 29, she said they had expected 20,000 to come. The eventual number appeared several times greater. What was not in doubt was that last week had marked a new phase of momentum in a long campaign. “I’ve always been involved,” she said of a movement that has its genesis in the protest against the decision not to prosecute the killer of Trayvon Martin in 2013. “To be honest anyone who is black and passionate is involved. But it feels like a different moment. The death of George Floyd and the protest has inspired many more people to speak up, black, white, everyone. The difference we are seeing is people are no longer prepared to be ignorant they want to educate themselves.”A lot of the people I spoke to suggested that this was their first march. They acknowledged the risks of the crowd, but felt they had no real choice. A young black woman from north London, who didn’t wish to give her name was holding a sign saying “Your silence is violence” and sitting at the foot of Gandhi’s statue. “The facts haven’t changed,” she said, “but the difference is more people are listening. I see it on social media, everyone that I know has been posting about this. And if you are young and you are not speaking up now, then it definitely says who you are. They don’t have to be here physically because we are in the middle of a pandemic, but if they are not here mentally and in spirit, well fuck ’em.”Terence Niemi, 28, from Colchester was also a first-time protester. “I felt like I should be here, there was no real choice this time. But it shouldn’t take losing another person’s life for us to form together. Hopefully in future we can make these kind of movements without this situation going down.”Da Vinci, a DJ from Brixton, said: “Asking people ‘stop oppressing us’ doesn’t really make much sense to me. But when you see people coming out together all around the world hopefully we can unite around that and find something positive out of it.”Fatima Abdulrahman had been on two previous protests last week. “You only have to look at the images on the internet to know why people are enraged,” she said. “There is a lot of anger people are not OK with how things are and there is a lot of pain to process.” She suggested the grimness of the last few weeks has also motivated that change isolation itself has sharpened the issues. “People have been at home, often alone for several months hearing about people dying, and a disproportionate number of them have been black people. And a disproportionate amount of black people have been suffering economically. That is another reason why we are here.”The summer looks likely to pitch those demands for social justice squarely against public health. The first test of that clash will be on Sunday afternoon when marchers have been invited to reassemble outside the US embassy in Vauxhall."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d528d3ba499ce77d0c3af9e117c69325761ba243/0_43_2547_1528/master/2547.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99b8736f3367251d711fd9f779cf78ff","title":"isolation and contemplation nadav kanders visual response to coronavirus","story":"In the first part of our series commissioned in conjunction with the Prix Pictet, a global award in photography and sustainability, photographers who have won or been shortlisted for the award over the last decade have been asked to make a personal response to the Covid-19 crisis. The ability to move us beyond cliche is a characteristic photographers shortlisted for the Prix Pictet share, and it is important as we grapple with the reality of the world as we emerge from the Covid-19 crisis.The global lockdown has birthed new cliches wildlife cautiously exploring the unpeopled streets, or iconic monuments devoid of tourists, ignored save the occasional solitary inidual escaping their confinement.This commission asked photographers to move beyond the obvious, and present a series of images that respond to the new issues confronting us, and begin to plot a route to a new future and new ways of thinking about the world.Some occasions or occurrences in my life present themselves in a way that, if not ignored, inform me as to how I tick, what is fundamental to me. What it is I constantly strive to grasp and express. It has the effect of bringing understanding to that that is intuitive.At the point this lockdown began, I was no stranger to solitude and the effect it has on me and my practice as an artist. When we separated ourselves, I was very aware of the feelings that arose in me from the forced distancing and shocked at how quickly my surroundings, which were until that moment a safe place, became quickly alienating and unsafe to me. Another human being becoming a threat, an enemy, a carrier of a deadly disease. I began thinking about the importance of touch to non-verbal communication and how the lack of it would produce a yearning for connection. My knee-jerk reaction was to go to my studio and riff off these feelings, which I tried but then resisted knowing the knee jerk in my case always results in work of little value.\u0026nbspWeeks later I began again.\u0026nbspThis is work with the guts of solitude, melancholy and longing which bring up feelings of both beauty and terror.I think of a quote by Rilke: “Love your solitude and try to sing out with the pain it causes you.”\u0026nbspSo many feelings are at play and I was aware that in this quiet time there was a much bigger picture playing out, and it will continue to play out in our future.As a child growing up in Johannesburg, South Africa, we had no TV. I had an electric train set that was made in Germany where my father was born. It was set out on a spare dining room table. No hills or tunnels, just a figure of eight with a station.\u0026nbspThere were small human figures dotted about, who with my imagination performed many duties depending on how I saw my mini world that day.In my studio I have many items on shelves that, out of context, are odd, causing to arise a mildly uncomfortable feeling in a viewer. Animal skulls, dolls, wigs, porcelain flowers, crucifixes and small humans, some from my train driving days.These folks performed once again for me and mirrored back at me the feelings of Solitude – Quietude – Contemplation that I felt most strongly in the first days of lockdown.\u0026nbspThe feeling of the unknown.\u0026nbspIt seemed not by chance that the Royal Academy show of Leon Spilliaert was opened just before the lockdown. The painter wandering alone at night near the water’s edge in Ostend and bringing his memory into the studio to paint the feeling as much as the scene he had just experienced.This series of work I hope brings up feelings of isolation, distance and contemplation in a viewer as well as a realisation that this time in history is bigger than just this virus. That it holds potential in its invitation to consider that this event is willing us human beings collectively to move towards balancing our indiscriminate use of nature’s resources.\u0026nbspThis is not a warped reality, it is just reality, and it comes out of man being out of balance with nature.\u0026nbsp• Prix Pictet was founded in 2008\u0026nbspby the Geneva-based Pictet Group, with the mandate to use photography to move beyond cliche and deliver powerful messages about sustainability to a global audience.

They also warned of a “dramatic” drop in capacity at NHS hospitals.The Observer spoke to organisations including the Royal College of GPs, the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, the Royal College of Anaesthetists, the NHS Confederation and NHS Providers on how ministers should plan for a potential second wave. They called for:• An “aggressive public health campaign” to boost flu immunisation to stop the NHS having to deal with flu as well as Covid-19 outbreaks this winter.• The retraining of more hospital staff so that they could be a “reserve” force, redeployed in the event of a second peak.• The retaining of private hospital space to help deal with the NHS backlog.• A comprehensive plan to protect care homes from a second peak in Covid-19 infections.There were also demands for more open communication about the risks ahead and the strategy being adopted, following Johnson’s much-criticised claim that the UK would have a “world-beating” test and trace system by the start of June.Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said: “The real concern is that we don’t have that same degree of trust, because we’re not having the kind of honest and open debates that we need. We seem to be resorting to kind of fairly cheap political rhetoric about stuff being world class, when it clearly isn’t.”Professor Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: “I think the criticism that we can’t see a strategy is a legitimate criticism … We need a strategy for test and trace, for PPE, for the use of technology, for maintaining Covid services and opening up non-Covid services.”A further 204 deaths from Covid-19 in the UK have been announced, bringing the total to 40,465.The growing anxiety about the dangers of a second wave of illness comes as anti-racism protesters defied safety warnings by gathering in their thousands across the UK to demonstrate against the death of George Floyd in America. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, and Priti Patel, the home secretary, had urged people to avoid mass gatherings. Scientists warned yesterday that the anti-racism protests posed a serious public health risk. “Any mass gathering risks significant numbers of further cases,” said Keith Neal, Nottingham University’s emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases. “There is clear evidence that banning mass gatherings was one of the most effective and important parts of the lockdowns across European countries.”Calls are growing for a rapid public inquiry into the Covid-19 crisis to be launched as soon as this summer. Una O’Brien, the former permanent secretary at the Department for Health, wrote in a blog: “What better time than this summer, as the first serious phase of the pandemic recedes, for the UK government to … launch an impartial, independent and comprehensive inquiry here?”A Department of Health spokesperson said: “We will continue to be guided by the latest scientific advice – including from world-renowned epidemiologists – and give the NHS whatever it needs, as we have done throughout this unprecedented pandemic.“Thanks to the hard work and dedication of NHS staff, hospitals have not been overwhelmed and intensive care capacity continues to meet the needs of patients. Our new NHS Test and Trace service is also up and running and anyone in this country with symptoms can book a test, with the majority getting their results back within a day.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1194546eda722ccdbe39321f2bc8dbd6a938fc6/0_205_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a5101c1a6ee268f6465156fb46c7c3a","title":"after six months of coronavirus how close are we to defeating it","story":"Doctors say they are making progress in understanding the disease, but warn against hoping for an early vaccineCovid-19 has now been afflicting humans for six months – first in China and later in other nations as the virus embarked on its global conquest.\u0026nbspThe experience has been a grim one for our species. To date, more than six million people have been infected and an estimated 400,000 have died, a toll that will inevitably continue to rise for years to come.Our world has been transformed in the process. Lockdowns have been imposed, borders have been closed, care homes for the elderly have been ravaged by illness, and national economies placed under extreme strain.\u0026nbspEpidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.Yet we have only reached the halfway point of the disease’s progress towards its first anniversary, timing that raises a host of concerns and questions about our ability to navigate our way through this pandemic. What exactly have we learned about Covid-19 over the past six months? How quickly and how well have we responded to the challenges posed by it?And, much more importantly, what questions do we most urgently need to answer over the next six months? Answers from researchers and doctors should tell us how we might survive one of the worst crises to affect humanity in modern times.Were we ready?One emphatic response from scientists stresses that it is now clear we were very badly prepared for the arrival of Covid-19. “This disease has turned out to be much worse than any of the pandemics that we had been anticipating and making plans to counter,” said Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine.This point was also stressed by David Nabarro, professor of global health at Imperial College London, and an envoy for the World Health Organization on Covid-19. “When we first encountered this disease, we thought it was just a respiratory illness that affected the upper part of the chest. Now it is clear that it can cause illnesses of the sinus can affect the lining of blood vessels and can lead to blood clots developing. The disease has also been linked to extreme fatigue, kidney damage and heart attacks – and quite often\u0026nbspin relatively young people. This is not a disease to be underestimated.”Nor is it likely to disappear in the near future, added Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University. “Having lived with Covid-19 for six months now, the most important thing we have learned is that we are going to have to live with it for an awful lot longer. Essentially we are six months into a lifelong relationship.”In such circumstances, lockdown – which Woolhouse described as “a panic measure” but a necessary one – is no longer sustainable and the problem we face over the coming months is to find ways to keep the disease at bay without recourse to imposing lockdown restrictions and their associated economic and emotional harm. And that will not be easy – as has been made clear from other lessons learned over the past six months, Woolhouse added.\u0026nbspDisease of old age“The one key feature that we have come to appreciate about Covid-19 is that it is a disease of old age,” he said. “The chance that a person over 75 will die from it is actually 10,000 times greater than it is for a 15-year-old who gets infected. It is really striking.”The problems concerning the disease’s impact on adults start when a person reaches 50 and get exponentially greater for each additional year of age. “That means a significant proportion of our population – those over 75 – need protecting from this virus because its consequences for them are extremely serious,” added Woolhouse. “But is it right to lock up grandchildren to save their grandparents? In a sense that is what we have been doing up until now.”One idea would be to put extremely strict biosecurity systems around care homes to ensure the coronavirus never gets into them. Staff – from cleaners to carers – would be tested constantly for the presence of the virus. “Nobody would be allowed to enter without a same-day test,” said Woolhouse. “It is as simple as that.”But as Woolhouse acknowledged, the vast majority of those over 75 don’t live in care homes. They live in their own houses. “That means we are going to have to invent the concept of household biosecurity for these people. That is one of the most urgent tasks we now face.”Implementing such ideas has only become feasible because virus testing technology has improved both in accuracy and scale over the past couple of months. And that offers other advantages and opportunities to understand other questions about Covid-19, said Anne Johnson, professor of epidemiology at University College London.\u0026nbsp“Until now we have been relying heavily on mathematical models to try to understand how the virus is behaving and spreading through communities. However, mathematical models are only as good as the data that underpins them.”With the development of new virus and antibody tests, there should therefore be far greater, data-based understanding of the appearance and spread of Covid-19 cases in Britain. She said: “Simple details of time, place and person – we are crying out for that information in order to really understand this epidemic. We have got to be forensic in our efforts to pinpoint chains of transmission so we can stamp them out.”A major problem in trying to track and control Covid-19 has arisen because infections are often being spread by symptomless carriers, Johnson added. “At first we did not realise that people could be transmitting unwittingly. That has been a key lesson of the past few months.”Collecting detailed epidemiological data should now be a priority for coming months, said Johnson. “What is the age, gender, ethnicity and the postal code of people who test positive? And is that infected person a healthcare worker, or are they a relative of one, or are they living with one? Once you can establish these facts quickly, then you will make an enormous difference in closing down the disease. In effect, we are entering the realm of the bug detective.”And then there is the critical issue of the kind of immunity that has been acquired by those already infected by the virus. “Studies suggest antibodies are raised in patients’ blood after they are infected and these could provide protection against future Covid-19 infections,” said Hibberd. “Reasonable estimates suggest protection might last for periods of between six months to a couple of years. However, we need to find out exactly how long such protection will last because it will have an important bearing on how the disease progresses through a population.”The longer that antibodies provide protection then the slower the disease will spread. As a result, scientists are asking that those iniduals who were among the first to be infected have their blood sampled and their antibody levels tested. “Have numbers of antibodies in their blood held steady or have they started to go down after only a few months? That is key research and it needs to be done now,” said Hibberd.For those who were on the front line dealing with Covid-19 cases when significant numbers began to arrive in hospitals in April, the battle to save patients overwhelmed by critical breathing difficulties was a fraught and often bewildering business. Slowly doctors and nursing staff have improved treatments, however. “We are much better now at pinpointing those who will need intensive care and those who can be sent home,” said Tom Wingfield, a clinician based at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.“And some promising techniques have emerged in the interim – such as the potential for continuous positive airway pressure machines, respirators that fit round your face, to help patients breathe. These are showing encouraging results.”However, Wingfield stressed there were still many unknowns about the impact of Covid-19 on patients. “For example, it has become clear that many patients are having blood clots, and the sicker you are the more likely it is you have one. But what we don’t know yet is which patients should be given blood thinners from the day they arrive to counter this clotting. Nor do we know how long we should continue that treatment.“The crucial point is that we are gathering data all the time – from blood tests, oxygen levels, respiratory rates – and hopefully that will help us to predict who is likely to have the worst reaction to the virus and who should be given the most intense treatments. In another six months, we should be much better informed.”Room for optimismIn the long term a vaccine may emerge as humanity’s saviour. However, most scientists believe it is a relatively far-off prospect – one that is unlikely to reach us for a year or two at best. As Woolhouse put it: “A vaccine is a hope, not a strategy.”\u0026nbspThis point was also stressed by Nabarro: “We have got to get out of this mirage sense that all will be resolved when a vaccine appears at the end of this year to save us. That is not going to happen. And even when we do get a vaccine that is safe and works, there is still the issue of how we get it to the 7.8 billion people who inhabit our planet. The global eradication of a disease is a very, very difficult business. We managed it with polio eventually, but we are still trying to get rid of measles.”However, there is still some room for optimism, say scientists. “Yes, a vaccine is some way off but antiviral therapies look more hopeful,” said Hibberd. “Trials are now under way for a number of antiviral drugs that were developed to deal with other diseases but which are now being repurposed in the hope that they can be used to tackle Covid-19. Results are expected in a few months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/570768276beb5525f71827f62d955208ec95e5be/0_391_4544_2727/master/4544.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=5e621779ced21c014e716f4931af57b5","title":"churches coronavirus reopen religion worship","story":"Church congregations were susceptible to the spread of the virus, and the opportunity to welcome parishioners again has been met with scepticismJulia Kubis’s 81-year-old mother – a diabetic for nearly six decades – wanted to visit the Church of St Thomas Aquinas in Brooklyn, New York.Kubis conceded, even in the face of a coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 109,000 people in the US so far, has ravaged the elderly and immunocompromised, and has claimed the lives of up 25 parishioners of St Thomas Aquinas and its sister parish. Her mom agreed to wear a mask and blue nitrile gloves, albeit amid some griping.\u0026nbsp“She hasn’t been out of the house in almost three months, and the first place I took her was here,” Kubis told the .\u0026nbspDays prior, Kubis had requested the day off from work and walked a mile and a half to St Thomas Aquinas so she could be there when it reopened to the public.“It’s so pretty, it’s so special and so spiritual, just to be able to gaze at the crucifix and pray there,” she said. “It’s a wonderful feeling.”\u0026nbspCovid-19 transformed traditional religious services and ceremonies into potential breeding grounds for infection, forcing churches across the United States to shut their doors for weeks. Political directives that temporarily barred large-scale assemblies, including faith-based gatherings, incited outright defiance and contentious court battles among pockets of the country’s Christian majority. One high-profile case, brought by a California church, has already ided the supreme court.Now, despite America’s confirmed death toll outpacing that of every other country, US towns and cities are beginning to re-emerge from a months-long hibernation. So too are religious institutions, encouraged by Donald Trump.Back in March, Trump envisioned teeming churches for Easter Sunday, even as the number of coronavirus cases swelled in the US. In the thick of the pandemic’s first wave, his suggestion ignited swift backlash and ridicule.\u0026nbspAnd yet, in late May, Trump echoed his previous statements when he proposed that houses of worship be given the go-ahead\u0026nbsp“to open right now, for this weekend”. In an assertion that baffled legal experts, who challenged whether the president commanded such unchecked authority, Trump claimed he would “override” governors who ignored his call.\u0026nbsp“Some governors have deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential, but have left out churches and other houses of worship,” Trump said at the time. “It’s not right, so I’m correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential.”\u0026nbspBut just because churches can reopen doesn’t mean they will, or that the community will\u0026nbspfeel prepared to immediately follow. Much like hair salons and universities, churches have shown they’re dangerously susceptible to the virus’ contagion, with sometimes lethal consequences. In hard-hit New York City, where some congregations have seen dozens of members die, the opportunity to welcome parishioners again has been met with uneven enthusiasm.\u0026nbspIn midtown Manhattan, St Peter’s Church remains closed. The church lies inside a building with art galleries, a theater company and a senior center. Its ministry is focused on communities that have been especially vulnerable during the pandemic, including immigrants, essential workers and people diagnosed with HIVAids. More than 40 members have died of coronavirus.“We are not at a place yet to have any kind of in-person gatherings,” said Christopher Vergara, the congregation’s president.\u0026nbsp“It’s still a very difficult moment, and I think that the protocols have to be very, very well established and respected. If not, we’ll continue with infection in our communities,” said Pastor Fabián Arias, who serves St Peter’s Spanish-language members.Felix Pinzón, a member of the church, lost his 45-year-old brother and his livelihood to the virus. He understands why St Peter’s hasn’t reopened yet, and the chaos one bad move could cause.\u0026nbspBut because of the hardship he’s endured, he also wants to be close to God.He likened mass to a football game: watching on TV isn’t quite the same as watching from the field, live.“You feel a different energy when you’re together\u0026nbspwith the rest of the people,” he said.In a YouTube video heralding St Thomas Aquinas’s reopening in Flatlands, Brooklyn, bright yellow caution tape blocked off some pews, and clear blue X’s marked others to enforce social distancing measures. Between 20 and 25 parishioners have died at the church and its sister parish during the pandemic, said Father Dwayne Davis, the pastor there.Among the casualties were a grandfather and father, who died around the same time and left behind a young son. Their family lived just two houses down from the church Davis had baptized the boy years back.“That was really devastating for us,” Davis said.\u0026nbspWhen the Brooklyn diocese initiated a phased reopening, Davis was nervous about long lines of people wanting to come back. But almost a week after the cavernous church started operating at limited capacity and reduced hours, those expected crowds never came. Only a handful of people filed in at once for private prayer. Amid all the uncertainty, families cancelled their baptisms and weddings.“I don’t think they’re gonna all run at the same time,” Davis said. “It’s gonna take baby steps to really make this happen, which I think is a good thing.”Kubis, a lector at the church, texted others, encouraging their return. But during a week of visits, she never once counted even 10 worshippers inside.“That’s the saddest part of all,” she said. “I thought I’d see people waiting to get in, but I think people are just really still too afraid.”Barely nine miles away, in the neighboring borough of Queens, is St Bartholomew Parish. The church sits mere blocks from Elmhurst hospital, a health care facility that was overwhelmed by the virus early on and quickly became symbolic of the country’s struggle to control the pandemic.At least 68 of Saint Bartholomew’s parishioners have died from Covid-19, and in the erse immigrant community, out-of-work dishwashers and house cleaners without access to government benefits are going hungry. The local funeral home is still so overrun with corpses that it can’t host wakes, said Father Rick Beuther.The parish reopened for the first time last Monday morning, and Beuther was so excited the night before that he knew he would have a hard time sleeping. He opted against yellow tape markings around the church because he felt they were too evocative of a murder scene. In a more generous interpretation of the 10-person quota, he planned to allow ten families in at once.\u0026nbsp“I’m just trying to create an ambiance in the church, just to give people a little refuge, that it’s not a police state,” Beuther said. “We’re not gonna be patrolling, you know what I mean?”Although the three churches have come to disparate conclusions around reopening, they have rallied round their people during a time of incredible need.Through food vouchers, grocery deliveries and a new food pantry, they’ve been feeding members of the community. And as pastors blessed bodies, contacted the local hospital chaplain, or held intimate funerals, they cared for both the dead and the living, even amid a crippling public health emergency.\u0026nbsp“We are essential,” said Vergara. “We aren’t closed. And we continue to do the work of the church.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b16a6ef9e9f89c33d0c11cff7dbd198bbd2fdc5a/109_0_3281_1969/master/3281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92b695ba0671cb2aea53ca8006fcc157","title":"cuba coronavirus success contact tracing isolation","story":"While the WHO has signalled that Latin America is the new centre of the pandemic, cases in the communist-ruled island have fallen for two monthsEvery morning from 8am to 11 family doctor Liz Caballero winds through twisting alleys and ducks under washing lines in Havana’s Vedado district. She interviews families sharing crumbling art deco mansions and works her way through Soviet-style apartment blocks. She’s looking for signs.“It’s not uncommon for us to go door to door like this,” she said. “We’ve done it in the past when we’ve had dengue outbreaks.”The World Health Organization has identified Latin America as the new centre for coronavirus pandemic, but over the last two months, cases in Cuba have fallen. Cubans are now 24 times less likely to catch the virus than Dominicans, 27 times less likely to catch it than Mexicans, and more than 70 times less likely to be infected than Brazilians.Desperate for tourist revenue, Cuba closed its border later than most other countries in the region. But ever since the communist-ruled island shut out the outside world in\u0026nbsplate\u0026nbspMarch, it\u0026nbsphas thrown everything but the kitchen sink at the virus.The state has commanded tens of thousands of family doctors, nurses and medical students to “actively screen” all homes on the island for cases Covid-19 – every single day. That means that from Monday to Sunday, Dr Caballero and her medical students must walk for miles, monitoring the 328 families on her beat.“There’s no other country in the hemisphere that does anything approaching this,” said\u0026nbspWilliam Leogrande, professor of government at American University in Washington DC. “The whole organization of their healthcare system is to be in close touch with the population, identify health problems as they emerge, and deal with them immediately.“We know scientifically that quick identification of cases, contact tracing and quarantine are the only way to contain the virus in the absence of a vaccine – and because it begins with prevention, the Cuban health system is perfectly suited to carry out that containment strategy.”Cuba has so far reported 2,173 confirmed cases of and 83 deaths from coronavirus. Everybody who tests positive on the island is hospitalised. People suspected of carrying the virus are put into state-run “isolation centres”, usually for 14 days.Alejandro Gutiérrez, a 26-year-old French teacher, decided to leave Havana in April to wait out the pandemic in his native city of Trinidad. He and his family were stopped at a military checkpoint and sent to an isolation centre where they were confined inside a disused holiday villa.Though they weren’t allowed out of the villa, the family was scared of contracting the illness on-site.\u0026nbspFood was left outside their door, and three times a day they received checkups from a doctor.\u0026nbspAfter three days his family tested negative and were allowed to enter the city.As\u0026nbsphe was travelling from the capital, where cases were rising, to a city with no active cases, Guitiérrez considered the measure was “severe”, “rigid” but “for the common good”.Gail Reed, editor in chief of the journal Medicc Review, believes Cuba’s universal health system has allowed the government to “direct a unified rather than a fragmented strategy”.This tracing and isolation regime is made possible by human resources. Cuba has the\u0026nbsphighest doctor-to-patient ratio in the world\u0026nbsp(even when the 10,000 or so doctors currently\u0026nbspworking abroad\u0026nbspare subtracted from the total). And while health spending was cut during Raúl Castro’s time as president (2008–2018), the island spends a higher\u0026nbspproportion of its GDP on healthcare\u0026nbspthan any other country in the region.But the state’s response also involves coercion. A\u0026nbsprecent study\u0026nbsppublished in the Lancet found that while “institutional-based isolation” is more effective at containing Covid-19 than “home-based isolation”, countries in Europe and the US struggle to set up isolation centres “due to a lack of social acceptability or negative public perceptions”. In Cuba there is no judicial recourse to enforced isolation. The use of face masks in public\u0026nbspis mandatory, and people who refuse to wear them can be fined or even jailed.And the 28,000 medical students “mobilised” to help doctors and nurses to detect symptoms and trace contacts must comply if they want to graduate.At the beginning of this pandemic, President Donald Trump in the US called Covid-19 a “hoax”. Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has called coronavirus “a little flu”, attended rallies, and sacked health ministers calling for social distancing.At a time when eccentric, anti-science populists run the region’s most powerful countries, Cuba’s evidence-based approach – and strict enforcement – sets it apart.“Their real success has been applying the most important public health measures that physicians around the world know are effective,” said Reed. “And they’ve had the political will to make it work.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbdc249c5b26f70694559162d27d269ec426d57a/0_24_3753_2252/master/3753.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=caf0dfa48e80f38e29b2b7a8a4e92662","title":"health experts on the psychological cost of covid 19","story":"Tomorrow, when the latest Deathometer of Covid is announced in sonorous tones,Whilst all the bodies still mount and curl towards the middle of the curveHeaped one atop and alongside the otherMy sister will be among those numbers...died without the soft touch of a loved one’s hand.

Yet in Italy, Rome was relatively spared while the villages of Lombardy experienced very high rates of sickness and death. Then again, one Lombard village – Ferrara Erbognone – stood out for not recording a single case of Covid-19 at the height of the wave. Nobody knows why.The puzzle is not just Italian. From the beginning, Covid-19 struck unevenly across the globe, and scientists have been trying to understand the reasons. Why are some populations or sectors of a population more vulnerable than others? Or to turn the question around, why are some groups relatively protected?In the Observer last weekend, neuroscientist and Covid-19 modeller Karl Friston of University College London suggested – on the basis of his comparison of German and British data – that the relatively low fatality rates recorded in Germany were due to unknown protective factors at play. “This is like dark matter in the universe: we can’t see it, but we know it must be there to account for what we can see,” he said.While this is a novel view – most experts praise Germany’s lockdown and systematic testing regime – others are working hard to identify factors which are modulating the spread of Covid-19 and in doing so could explain other puzzles – such as why Japan seems to have avoided a lethal first wave despite its relatively old population and lacklustre public health response, or why Denmark, Austria and the Czech Republic have reported no surge in cases despite their early easing of lockdown measures. That could shape how governments manage the risks of a second wave.One thing seems clear: there are many reasons why one population is more protected than another. Theoretical epidemiologist Sunetra Gupta of the University of Oxford thinks that a key one is immunity that was built up prior to this pandemic. “It’s been my hunch for a very long time that there is a lot of cross-protection from severe disease and death conferred by other circulating, related bugs,” she says. Though that cross-protection may not protect a person from infection in the first place, it could ensure they only experience relatively mild symptoms.Gupta’s hunch has remained just that, because of the lack of data on immunity to Covid-19. Antibody testing, as we know, was slow to get going and unreliable to begin with, and the results to date suggest that the proportions of populations carrying antibodies to the Covid-19 virus are often in single or low-double digits. New, more sensitive antibody tests that have become available in recent weeks could soon provide a much more accurate picture if deployed widely enough, but there are already hints that the results to date may be underestimates.First there was evidence based on diagnostic testing of postmortem samples from patients who died in December that the virus was circulating in western countries – notably France and the US – about a month earlier than was initially thought. New research shows that another component of the human immune response – T cells, which help orchestrate the antibody response – show memory for coronavirus infection when exposed to Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.In a paper published in Cell on 14 May, researchers at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California reported that T cells in blood drawn from people between 2015 and 2018 recognised and reacted to fragments of the Sars-CoV-2 virus. “These people could not have possibly seen Sars-CoV-2,” says one of the paper’s senior authors, Alessandro Sette. “The most reasonable hypothesis is that this reactivity is really cross-reactivity with the cousins of Sars-CoV-2 – the common cold coronaviruses which circulate very broadly and generally give rather mild disease.”David Heymann, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who advises the World Health Organization on Covid-19, says these results are important, but cautions that cross-reactivity doesn’t necessarily translate into immunity. To determine whether it does would involve following a large number of people who show such cross-reactivity to see if they are protected, if not from infection with Covid-19, then at least from severe forms of the disease.It is, however, a reasonable hypothesis that exposure to other coronaviruses could confer protection, Sette says. “We’ve seen it before, for example with the 2009 H1N1 flu.” Older people fared well compared to other age groups in that pandemic, he says, probably because their immune systems had been primed by exposure to similar flu strains from decades before. That could be the reason the 2009 pandemic was less lethal than other flu pandemics in history, killing an estimated 200,000 people globally.If exposure to other coronaviruses does protect against Covid-19, Gupta says, then variability in that exposure could explain much of the difference in fatality rates between countries or regions. Exposure to the related virus that caused the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in 2002-4 might have afforded some protection to east Asians against Covid-19, for example.In late March, Gupta’s group published a paper that drew attention because it generated very different forecasts from those of epidemiologist Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London and his colleagues – to whom the UK government was listening most closely. The Oxford group suggested that up to half of the UK population could already have been infected by Sars-CoV-2, meaning the infection fatality rate (IFR) – the proportion of infected people who went on to die – was much lower than Ferguson’s group was indicating, and the disease was therefore less dangerous. Neither group had much data at that point, and Gupta says that her intention was to highlight that, in the absence of data, a wide range of scenarios should be considered.We know some of those vulnerability factors. Age is the most obvious one. Unlike with the 2009 flu, elderly people are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19 – a fact that might reflect the history of exposure to coronaviruses of different age cohorts. Comorbidity is another, and a third is being male. According to Garima Sharma of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, who with colleagues recently published a paper on sex differences in Covid-19 mortality, women are protected by virtue of having a “backup” X chromosome. “X chromosomes contain a high density of immune-related genes, so women generally mount stronger immune responses,” she says.Socioeconomic status, climate, culture and genetic makeup could also shape vulnerability, as could certain childhood vaccines and vitamin D levels. And all of these factors can vary between countries. The Japanese might have been afforded some protection, for example, by their custom of bowing rather than shaking hands. And though most of the disparity between the sexes is down to biology, Sharma says some of it is due to social and behavioural factors, with women being more likely to wash their hands and seek preventive care.The UK, which has recorded the second highest death rate from Covid-19 after Spain, has not looked after its elderly so well – deciding at one point to discharge patients from hospitals back to care homes without testing them for the disease. The government’s advice to 1.5 million UK citizens with underlying health conditions to self-isolate for three months from late March may have helped protect those people, but for Gupta the UK’s high death rate reflects a deeper problem – years of erosion of community support services that provided pastoral care. “There is just not enough investment in the NHS and in that GP or other frontline inidual who advises the vulnerable person,” she says.Holding to her hunch, she believes that lockdown was an overreaction and that frontline care and protection of the vulnerable – which should have been a priority from the beginning – should be prioritised now. She also thinks that the worst is behind us, and that while subsequent waves can’t be ruled out, they will probably be less bad than what we have experienced so far. The disease will settle into an endemic equilibrium, in her view, perhaps returning each winter like a seasonal flu.Friston’s models also suggest that immunity in the population is higher than data indicates, but for him it’s not clear how long that immunity will last – and he argues that test-and-trace protocols should be put in place now, ahead of any possible second wave that might erupt once that immunity drops off. Heymann remains wary of models, which he says have too often been mistaken for reality in this pandemic, and he awaits more data: “I don’t think anybody can predict the destiny of this virus at this point in time,” he says."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Faster cuts in methane and nitrous oxide from farming needed \u0026ndash Stop Climate ChaosOn-farm measures are key to reducing emissions - environmental watchdogUnthinkable: Is nature\u0026rsquos mother god sending us a message with Covid-19?"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteria"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4264786.1590664226!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the irish farmers peering into cow pats for precious dung beetles","story":"When Eye on Nature was launched on this page in 1988, queries about beetles came by post, often with little drawings on the letters. Today, on sunny lockdown days, a prowl in the garden with a phone camera has yielded yet more coleoptera, slowly locomotory or paused in thought.Colourful shield bugs and ladybirds on summer leaves, longhorns perched on roses, ing beetles gliding through garden ponds, maybugs thumping on to garden tables... all have brought endless queries for a name.At the same time – and this may, perhaps, surprise you – some 40 Irish farmers have been roaming their cattle pastures, kicking apart the drier cow pats and peering into their depths. Retrieving small black beetles from their sticky weave, or floating them in a bucket of water, they have brought them home and put them in the freezer to send, in due course, to Bruce Thompson.Young, married, with two children, Thompson works with his father running a dairy farm with 230 cows on the slopes of the Slieve Blooms in Co Laois. Most farmers of that size, concerned about the cows’ internal parasites, inject or pour on costly quantities of a “worming” drug, notably ivermectin.This does, indeed, kill cattle parasites, but also emerges unchanged in their dung, with lethal impact on the larvae of dung beetles. There are parts of the insect community that can make cow pats disappear into the soil, sometimes in days, their nutrients recycled for plants to grow.Googling dung beetles brings up fascinating photographs of inidual beetles rolling balls of dung uphill with their hind legs. Many tropical species do, indeed, pose for pictures in this manner. Ireland’s largest dung beetle (the dor beetle in my drawing) is content to dig a vertical burrow beside the cow pat and lay eggs at the bottom, together with pellets of dung for the larvae to recycle as food.Most of the decomposition, however, is done by tiny dung beetles a few millimetres long, These are mainly the Aphodius family, which lay their eggs beneath the dung’s surface. A study by scientists at Teagasc and UCC found that, in cow pats with a tiny trace of the anthelmintic drug ivermectin, the toll on the development of beetle larvae was substantial.Bruce Thompson had a keen interest in soils and their wildlife and was equipped with his own microscope. He decided ,with his father, to minimise dosing with “mectins” to give young stock a chance of developing their own immunity to parasites. With a more diagnostic approach, the dosing was phased out for the adult cows and they have had none of the drug since 2017.A chance conversation with a UK entomologist fired Thompson’s interest in further study. With more encouragement from Aidan O’Hanlon, entomologist at the Natural History Museum, he sought a research scholarship from the Irish Nuffield Foundation.It took him to Australia and New Zealand, where the introduction of alien dung beetles has been helping to rescue cattle farming from pastures polluted with undecomposed manure.Australia’s native dung beetles evolved with the droppings of kangaroos and wallabies, not cattle. The government has subsidised the establishment of colonies of dung beetles from Hawaii, Africa and Europe. In New Zealand, packages of beetles are offered commercially to set against the costs of riverbank fencing and planting to curb the run-off from dung.The case for conserving coprophagous coleoptera has been strengthened even further by a large-scale field trial in southwest England. Researchers at the University of Bristol set out some 250 1-kilo cow pats of parasite-infected dung. Those exposed to Aphodius beetles left lower numbers of parasites in grass around the pats. Such findings, reported in the Journal of Applied Ecology in August 2017, demonstrated to Thompson that the beetles were helping him to lower the need for ivermectin.It encouraged him to launch “Operation Defecation”, meant to build a baseline of the types and prevalence of dung beetles on farms with different practices of “worming”. Dissolving chunks of dung in a bucket of water can bring a dozen different species of beetles floating to the surface.Thompson’s recruitment of farming volunteers has been helped by his involvement in local farming groups and an appeal on Twitter headed “All good things come in poos!” (@Friesian_man).His “citizen science” sampling is undertaken in the hope that intensive farming can be partnered with respect for the natural ecosystems of the soil. For Teagasc’s researchers, the quest is for evidence “that informs satisfactory trade-offs between conservation targets, animal welfare and livestock production”.In the meantime, perhaps, as the Bristol research paper concludes: “Livestock management practices should focus on reducing reliance on anthelmintics to minimise damage to natural dung beetle populations.”"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Alan BetsonNational car test (NCT) centres are to begin reopening from Monday, along with the National Driver Licence Service and Driver Theory Test facilities.Motorists whose car test was affected by the failure of lifts in testing centres earlier this year are to be given priority for testing.The gradual resumption of the NCT will begin with the opening of 15 NCT centres across the State. The reopening of more centres will be announced in the coming weeks and updates will be posted on ncts.ie.All 43 theory test centres will reopen from Monday and people can book their tests online. The opening of the Driver Licence Services will allow those who have passed the theory test to apply for a learner permit. It will also enable people to apply for a replacement licence that may have been lost or stolen.However, the Driver Testing Service is not reopening yet. Minister for Transport Shane Ross said while he saw see the possibility of lorry, bus and motorcycle testing resuming soon, there were issues to overcome to restart car driving tests. “These challenges include maintaining social distancing as a car driving test means close contact in an enclosed space between the driver tester and the learner driver for periods in excess of 15 minutes.“I can assure learner drivers that officials in my department and the Road Safety Authority are looking at all available options to get car driving tests started again as soon as possible,” he said.The reopening of full services will take place on a phased basis and car owners will remain subject to Government regulations on travel and social distancing.Motorists are advised to check relevant websites for updates on NCT centres opening in their area. No walk-in appointments will be accommodated.All services must be paid for with creditdebit cards. No cash will be taken.Commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing resumed on May 18th.Mr Ross said social distancing should always be maintained and anyone wishing to use the services remained subject to the Government’s current restrictions on travel. From Monday, people can travel 20km from home or anywhere within their county, whichever is the greater distance.As the validity of various certificates and licences relating to these services was extended on March 28th for up to four months, demand for these services has been reduced in the short term, but motorists are advised to make appointments in a timely fashion.Mr Ross said he was “acutely aware that some people do need to avail of these services now”.“For example, there are vehicle owners who were affected by the vehicle lift issue at the NCTS and who need to complete their test.

It was one of two occasions where the Ministers deviated from the advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) the other being the decision to allow shopping centres to reopen from June 15th.Minister for Business Heather Humphreys, whose public profile and stock across Government has risen during the crisis, argued that retailers in shopping centres should not be at a disadvantage to those on the high street, whose reopening had been agreed by NPHET.Recent weeks had seen arguments within Government, and outside, about how much Ministers should adhere to the advice of NPHET and chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan.The discussion and decisions across the two Cabinet meetings this week gave Ministers buy-in, and a sense of ownership, to what was ultimately announced.But if there was pressure applied to NPHET and Dr Holohan to accelerate the lifting of the lockdown, it is likely to have happened behind the scenes.Medical adviceVaradkar and Harris insist that the politicians have worked alongside their medical advisers throughout this process and, at the post-Cabinet press conference on Friday, the Taoiseach acknowledged that there was a back and forth between Government and NPHET on the way forward.He pointedly told the Dáil on Thursday that he had asked Dr Holohan and NPHET to examine if some elements of the lockdown exit plan could be accelerated – measures moved from phase three to two and phase four to three, for example.Dr Holohan had told NPHET he had been thinking about how to merge the final phases together, and Government sources pointed out that the decision to cut the original plan down from five stages to four came from NPHET itself.Sources said NPHET discussions this week included claims that a decision not to bring forward more phases could be regretted if a further lockdown had to be imposed in the event of a second Covid-19 wave.After the acceleration was announced, those who argued that the Cabinet should take more control away from NPHET were satisfied. Those who said NPHET and Government Buildings moved in line with each other pointed to a correlation between Dr Holohan’s letter to Harris recommending to proceed to the next phase on Monday and the final Cabinet announcement.Those who had argued that the plan should be speeded up to lift the economy, boost domestic tourism and reduce the number of people out of work believed it was their stance that had won out.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Man (60) dies some 500 miles north of Sydney after board-riders pull him to shoreLarge crowd gathers shortly after legislature outlaws insults to China\u0026rsquos national anthemTrump administration has presented China with \u0026lsquoopportunities\u0026rsquo on the world stageStorm made landfall further south than expected giving some respite to metropolis ravaged by coronavirusDeath at Wuhan\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquowhistleblower hospital\u0026rsquo prompts wave of anger at hospital authoritiesSchools in deprived areas reported girls using newspapers and rags in attempt to manage periodAnnual vigil to mark Tiananmen Square massacre cancelled but activists still plan to rallyOfficials and media say US criticism of Hong Kong policing illustrates double standardsExperts fear country\u0026rsquos caseload could reach 1m in several weeks if virus is not curbedBejing approved decision to create laws for Hong Kong to curb sedition, secession, terrorismMove paves way for anti-sedition laws which rights advocates say will threaten city\u0026rsquos freedomsAt least 69 cases this week linked to cluster of infections at logistics facilityThousands take to streets to oppose Beijing-backed laws curtailing city\u0026rsquos freedomsMove to impose security law illustrates Beijing\u0026rsquos increasing tendency to flex its muscleProtesters get ready for more demonstrations against proposed Beijing lawsCommissioner in territory says contentious new security law aimed at \u0026lsquotroublemakers\u0026rsquoPM has made most of her communication skills and the country\u0026rsquos political cultureCian English (19), from Carlow, died following fall from Gold Coast apartmentChina proposes path to imposing rules used against dissidents on the mainlandPolice fire tear gas in popular shopping district as protesters take to the streetsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4272018.1591378999!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barnier insists pragmatic workarounds are possible for trade in the north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichel Barnier holds the Official Journal of the European Union C34 during a press conference on Friday in Brussels regarding the fourth round of Brexit negotiations. Photograph:  Daina Le Lardic PoolGetty ImagesBusinesses in Northern Ireland should be able to use workarounds and exemptions to make checks on goods on the Irish Sea border less onerous, chief European Union negotiator Michel Barnier has said.He was responding to an opinion column in The  in which contributor Newton Emerson expressed concerns that the EU was cynically taking a “maximalist” position on checks in order to use the North as a “bargaining chip”.Mr Barnier emphasised that the special arrangements for the North – under which it will apply EU customs rules so that checks take place in ports and airports there rather than on the land border with the Republic – had been jointly drawn up and agreed with the British government, and that there was room for pragmatism within them.“Regarding Mr Emerson’s concerns ... I would say that we can take into account those concerns within the framework as it’s currently written, because it’s written in a very precise way,” Mr Barnier told reporters after the latest round of EU-UK talks concluded.Imported“Simplified declarations can be used for large economic operators, supermarkets being one of them,” he said.For goods that are imported into the North from Britain or elsewhere outside the EU, exemptions on tariffs are possible if it can be proved that the produce will not enter the single market.“This is something we are discussing with the United Kingdom as we speak,” Mr Barnier said. “We’re ready to work with the UK further on all aspects of what the EU customs code can offer in order to facilitate trade and do everything we can do that end. But for that we need genuine commitment also from the UK side also on a number of technical issues which I have to say isn’t always forthcoming.”Special arrangementsA joint EU-UK committee is currently overseeing the implementation of the special arrangements for the North agreed as part of Britain’s withdrawal from the EU.\u0026nbspOfficials have said that plans for additional infrastructure to enforce checks need to be agreed swiftly in order to be ready for when the new arrangements come into force at the end of the year.Mr Barnier insisted he was keen to find a compromise. “I’m not dogmatic. Sometimes there is a bit of spin amongst UK politicians saying I’m some kind of dogmatic person and representing a technocratic commission, but I’m a pragmatic man,” he said.“I’m sure if we don’t get bogged down in ideological debate with pragmatism we can pull this off.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"British-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsAshraf Ghani to lead country as rival Abdullah Abdullah oversees Taliban peace process, sources sayCeremony will end political deadlock that has dragged on for more than 500 daysArab and foreign jihadis ambush military convoys and assassinate officials as Baghdad and Damascus try to contain coronavirusThree men captured west of Caracas are the latest \u0026lsquoterrorists\u0026rsquo arrestedAt least 24 killed by suicide bomber in separate attack in Afghanistan on TuesdayStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4271818.1591367972!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk says sides need face to face talks to make progress","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t British Brexit negotiator David Frost: “Any such deal must of course accommodate the reality of the UK’s well-established position on the so-called ‘level playing field’, on fisheries, and the other difficult issues.” Photograph:  Kenzo TribouillardAFP via Getty ImagesBritain’s chief negotiator David Frost described progress in the Brexit talks as “limited”, adding that the two sides were close to the limits of what could be achieved without face-to-face talks.Speaking after the latest round of talks ended on Friday, he said the talks must intensify and accelerate but appeared to abandon Britain’s threat to leave the talks if the shape of a deal was not in sight by the end of June.“We need to conclude this negotiation in good time to enable people and businesses to have certainty about the trading terms that will follow the end of the transition period at the end of this year, and, if necessary, to allow ratification of any agreements reached,” he said.“For our part we are willing to work hard to see whether at least the outline of a balanced agreement, covering all issues, can be reached soon. Any such deal must of course accommodate the reality of the UK’s well-established position on the so-called ‘level playing field’, on fisheries, and the other difficult issues.”In its negotiating mandate last February, the British government said that if not enough progress was made in the talks by June it would “need to decide whether the UK’s attention should move away from negotiations and focus solely on continuing domestic preparations to exit the transition period in an orderly fashion”.A senior British negotiating official said on Friday that coronavirus had delayed progress and it was time for talks to move to a different format with a smaller group of negotiators. The official rejected Michel Barnier’s accusation that Britain was disregarding the political declaration Boris Johnson agreed with the EU last October alongside the withdrawal agreement.“We are committed to the political declaration. We see it, as it describes itself, as a document that sets out the parameters. It isn’t in itself a treaty,” the official said.The source said that Britain’s offer to accept tariffs on some products rather than agree to level playing field commitments on fair competition fell on “stony ground” in Brussels.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

Sometimes they go into administration then they will be bought up and reopened under different leadership.”Mr Roskilly explained that the impact of parents being unable to pay fees will be a “significant” blow to schools’ finances.This week the Minster School in York, a preparatory school which provides choristers for the city\u0027s cathedral and can trace its origins back to the seventh century, announced that it will close due to a cash shortfall caused by the Covid-19 crisis.Boris Johnson’s former prep school, Ashdown House Preparatory School in Sussex , also informed parents that it will shut down after 180 years due to the “harsh reality” of coronavirus which has prompted a sharp fall in demand for places.  Of the schools which have so far announced their closure, half are preparatory schools and so far three have specifically cited parents’ inability to continue paying fees as a factor in their decision to shut down.York Minster’s Dean, the Right Rev Dr Jonathan Frost, said that the Chapter of York was no longer able to keep up its investment in the school adding that in recent months “a number of families indicated they would be unable to keep their children at the Minster School.”Moreton Hall, a prep school in Suffolk which charges £24,000-a-year for boarders, explained its reasons for closure included the fact that many parents “now find themselves in difficult financial straits” as well as loss of income from summer camps and demand for overseas boarding drying up. Bramdean School in Exeter, another school to have closed in recent months told parents that it would be unable to “weather this storm”, adding that they had been receiving “daily requests” for fee remissions. Stephen Spriggs, managing director at William Clarence Education which assists some of the country’s leading public schools with recruitment, said that families falling into financial difficulties and pulling their children out is a real concern.“Preparatory schools have a lower head count which then means if they have a drop off in pupil numbers they lose out more because of the fees,” he said.“The biggest problem for schools is looking forward into next year. What kind of boarding offer can they really offer? If the international students don’t turn up in September and British families pull their children out, you can’t make the same forecasts.”Julie Robinson, chief executive of the Independent Schools Council, said it is “terribly sad” to hear of school closures as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. “It is impossible to predict with accuracy the full impact this pandemic will have,” she said. “Of course it is already affecting independent schools like all small businesses and also the livelihoods of fee-paying parents.”Ms Robinson said that independent schools are “highly adaptable to a change in the market”, adding that their switch to online learning which has been well received by parents and pupils.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"churches re open private prayer 15 june","story":"Churches and other places of worship are in line to open for private prayer from June 15, the Government has announced.Iniduals are expected to be able to reflect and pray while adhering to social-distancing rules - but worship groups, weddings and other services will still not be permitted.Downing Street said the changes would only be made if the Government\u0027s five tests for easing lockdown are met.Places of worship come under step three of the Government\u0027s road map to lift restrictions, and are not due to fully reopen until at least July 4.Ministers had been warned that worshippers felt disappointment and hurt at not being able to visit places of worship, despite some shops being reopened.A Government taskforce with faith leaders was launched last month to develop a plan to enable the phased and safe reopening of religious buildings.The Church of England closed all of its buildings on March 24, meaning funerals could only take place at crematoriums or the graveside. Clergy were encouraged to live-stream worship from their own homes.Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said: Ensuring places of worship can open again, beginning with private prayer by iniduals has been my priority.Their contribution to the common good of our country is clear, as places of solace, comfort, stability and dignity. And the need for them is all the greater as we weather the uncertainties of the pandemic.I\u0027m pleased the Prime Minister has announced that this is expected to happen from June 15. As Communities Secretary, I have worked with faith leaders and representatives to prepare guidance that ensures this can be done safely.People of all faiths have shown enormous patience and forbearance, unable to mark Easter, Passover, Ramadan or Vaisakhi with friends and family in the traditional way.As we control the virus, we are now able to move forwards with a limited but important return to houses of worship.A Number 10 spokeswoman added: The Prime Minister recognises how important it is, at this unprecedented time, for people to have the space to reflect and pray, to connect with their faith, and to be able to mourn for their loved ones.The PM is so grateful to people of all faiths and none, who have followed the social distancing guidelines, and in doing so, protected their communities.We plan to open up places of worship for inidual prayer in a safe, Covid-secure way that does not risk further transmission.The Bishop of London, Dame Sarah Mullally - who chairs the Church of England\u0027s Recovery Group, welcomed the Government\u0027s announcement that church buildings can open for private, inidual prayer.She said: This is the start of the journey for church buildings to open up safely in line with Government advice, and we look forward to their detailed guidance on enabling this first step to happen.Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the president of the Catholic Bishops\u0027 Conference of England and Wales, expressed gratitude for the great blessing of churches reopening.He added: This first step enables us to learn and prepare for those that will take us to a fuller use of our churches, for the celebration of Mass and other sacraments.Harun Khan, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), said the announcement was positive but added it lacks clarity for mosque leaders on how to implement the regulations for their congregations.He said: Mosques are provisioned primarily for congregational worship, so there is currently significant uncertainty and concern from mosque leaders on how the new regulations can actually be implemented.MCB has been consulting and engaging closely with hundreds of mosques and dozens of regional and national Muslim associations in the past few weeks on this topic, and it is clear that Muslim communities have been proactively planning and thinking about the challenges faced in re-opening mosques, ahead of official UK Government guidelines to confirm their plans.We urge the Government to give clear and unambiguous guidance, so that mosque trustees, staff, volunteers and others with leadership responsibilities have the clarity they need to plan effectively to ensure the safety and wellbeing of everyone.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"phes inability deliver mass testing delayed easing lockdown","story":"Efforts to release Britain from lockdown were repeatedly hampered by the failure to embark on mass surveillance testing to track levels of disease, it can be revealed.Three and a half weeks after the measures came in, Public Health England (PHE) said it remained unable to deliver a community testing programme for Covid, which could allow ministers to ease social distancing rules, documents show.The failings emerged alongside evidence suggesting PHE may have misled the Prime Minister when questioned about their testing regime.Last night the head of the Commons science and technology said the delays and obscurification by health officials had left Britain taking “decisions in the dark”.The minutes from a meeting of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), scientists pressed health officials on the importance of such a regime, to allow informed decision-making. But PHE refused to take on the work - so it was not until April 17 that the Office for National Statistics was asked to instead take it on.Minutes of the meetings show repeated frustration from Sage at the slow expansion of testing across the country.On March 13, routine testing and tracing of all cases of Covid-19 was stopped, with efforts limited to hospital cases, staff and suspected clusters of transmission.On the same day, PHE was asked by Sage to “urgently determine” how it would ramp up capacity to take up to 1,000 blood samples a week.It followed warnings on Feb 18 that PHE could only cope with tracking and tracing five new cases a week, with modelling suggesting this could be increased to 50 new cases. PHE has since insisted that it could cope with tracking efforts for more cases than five, though it has been unable to say what its capacity was.New evidence shows how even when Britain’s third case - “the Brighton super-spreader” - was being tracked, the PHE system was creaking so slowly that it took six days to track down some of those he had been in contact with.Doubts over the capacity for community testing had been raised repeatedly by Government advisory groups for months. On March 6, meetings from a meeting of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) details how Colin Brown, an infection diseases consultant representing PHE, said the anticipation is that PHE will not have the ability to test in the community as numbers increase.On March 16, minutes from a Sage meeting show the major advisory group “highlighted the critical importance of scaling up antibody serology and diagnostic testing and a solution is urgently required.On March 23, Boris Johnson ordered full lockdown, but the Sage minutes show that, another three and a half weeks later, there was still no plan to deliver surveillance testing - tracking levels of Covid-19 across the country. Minutes of 16 April state: “PHE confirmed it was unable to deliver a community testing programme. Sage agreed that if PHE is unable to undertake the programme then this should be undertaken within a repeated ONS-led household survey programme.”The request was finally made to the ONS the next day, The Sunday  understands.Greg Clark, chairman of the  Commons Science and Technology committee, said his questioning of PHE officials found they were “very opaque” about their responsibilities, with confusion about who had taken key decisions and why strategies were embarked on. He told The Sunday : “We turned off the light on being able to see the detailed nature of the course of the infection in this country.  That must be remedied so that in future, decisions are not taken in the dark.”PHE has said it is not responsible for determining overall testing strategy, with the Department of Health and Social Care in overall charge. Jeremy Hunt, chairman of the Commons Health Committee, said community testing was stopped without anyone understanding the strategic implications for tackling the virus”.Meanwhile, footage broadcast this week questions the accuracy of information given to the Prime Minister by PHE. In a meeting between Boris Johnson and Prof Yvonne Doyle,  PHE\u0027s director for health protection, at PHE\u0027s laboratory on March 1 shows the Prime Minister asking if those coming into the UK are automatically tested, or just those who are symptomatic.  In the video, broadcast on Channel 4’s Dispatches, Prof Doyle appears to imply that anyone coming from “hot zones” would get a test.When notified by The Sunday  yesterday, Duncan Selbie, chief executive at PHE, said in a statement: “There is nothing critical of PHE in what Sage had to say. It is a simple statement of fact that the scale of community serology testing would be more appropriate for the ONS, a decision that PHE supported and welcomed. PHE operates reference laboratories for novel and dangerous pathogens, not large scale pathology services.”Last night PHE refuted the suggestion it misled the PM. All symptomatic people coming from these so-called hot zones would have got a test - that was well understood by everyone, a source at the organisation said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 7th june 2020","story":"Peter Kerley cleans out the fountain at Cambridge Botanical Gardens as preparations are made for reopening Paul Grover for the  Coronavirus latest news: Scotland reports no new deaths for the first time since lockdownTrooping the Colour 2020: how the November weather brought about the Queen\u0026#39s summer birthdaySNP Health Minister admits she does not know when Scottish NHS staff will be regularly testedWatch live: Aerial view over London as anti-racism protests held over death of George FloydTravel updates: Quarantine \u0026#39full of loopholes\u0026#39 as BA owner launches legal challengeChurches to re-open for private prayer from 15 JuneHow the German Madeleine McCann suspect was discovered during a 13-year investigationChristian Brückner: Everything we know about the new German Madeleine McCann suspectKate and Gerry McCann: The couple who refuse to give up hopeWhen did Madeleine McCann go missing?

Every other celebrity, right up to the younger members of the royal family, now has *anxiety* which cynics like me see it as a sort of souped-up Get Out Of Jail card: ’I may be rich and famous but I’m not happy, I’m anxious, so don’t hate me, attack my gated community and steal my stuff!’ Could pleading insomnia be the new badge of virtue, proof that we are sensitive souls, a legion of little princesses tossing and turning on the dried pea of pandemic? As opposed to thick-skinned peasants like me who sleep tight and wake early to crack on with life despite being over sixty and overweight and therefore in two of the at-risk categories.Another related side-effect of lockdown has found two in five of us reporting more vivid dreams than usual. I personally haven’t had such nocturnal fun since my epic sex-dream about Gordon Ramsay (taking place over three consecutive nights and featuring lots of rather thrilling swearing) and was interested to find that increasingly we are dreaming of politicians. Earlier this week in the land of Nod, Boris Johnson and myself became secretly engaged but he told me that no-one must ever know as my father was a Communist.A few years back a Russian web search engine found that Vladimir Putin was the only inidual to appear regularly in his people’s dreams from the half a million requests a week the most common requests for interpretation were fish, children and snakes with teeth, water and pregnancies also making it into the top twenty alongside the Kremlin thug.Many dreamers may subconsciously be attracted to the politicians who haunt their slumber - but rather touchingly, some of my Tory-hating friends have had dreams in which they are pleasantly surprised by their bete noires. Sian ‘dreamt that Michael Howard was now PM and visited our local chip shop every Friday and everyone loved him’ while Mark ‘had a dream about Dominic Cummings. I was very rude to him. He said he liked the Wu Tang Clan. He was ever so nice and funny.’Laura is no lover of Trump but was pleasantly surprised when ‘Donald and Melania ordered me to take up lifetime employment on a Japanese whaling ship. I couldn’t start work before the POTUS and FLOTUS had located the highly specific, inordinately expensive roll up mattresses that we were to use as sleeping quarters on the slippy wooden deck of the leviathan vessel though.’I’m not crazy about the idea that, yet again, something magical and mysterious can be boiled down to our boring old chum stress ‘Disturbed sleep is often caused by stress, and can itself increase stress levels, creating a cycle that is difficult to break’ Dr Ivana Rosenzweig of Kings College gloomily warns us. I hoped we’d come out of this a tougher people, having seen what real trouble was and proud that we’d survived, but it will have been a wasted opportunity if we’re going to use it as yet another excuse to moan about PTSD because toilet paper ran out briefly in March.Look on the bright side now we can’t go to the cinema, how pleasing that we can see fantastical shows for free each night from the comfort of our own beds.

When will be the right time to explain to a nine-year-old the wariness that comes every time I lace my clunky green sneakers and pad through the streets in our almost entirely white Seattle community?I’m not a great runner I’m a 6ft-2, 220-pound plodder who tends to wilt at mile four. But I get out there as much as I can, to ease the stress and to feel free.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnd there lies the complication. Like many black runners, the very act of doing one of the things we love most in life comes with searing existential stress and constraint. I’ve been putting in hard, slogging miles since 2005, as I processed the fact my father was dying. Out there on city streets, visible and vulnerable, I have never jogged without the spectre of race. The way I look shadows my every stride.Sometimes it’s in the forefront of my mind – gutting, angry, mournful – as in the days after Ahmaud Arbery was chased and fatally shot. Sometimes it’s in the far corners, background noise, but still inescapable. I run to feel joy. To sense my 53-year-old legs churning and the wind pushing across my face, to think about stories I’m writing, to ponder ways to be a better husband and father. But I do all of this with a measure of vigilance.On my runs – which, pandemic aside, are usually solo – my mind hums with questions. Would it be better if I lived somewhere else? Why is the truck behind me on this street going so slowly? If I need to get away, which way would I sprint? If I need to turn and fight, would I kick, tackle or punch? Why did that officer circle back around and pass me twice?I live a 15-minute drive from downtown, amid blocks of tidy homes, old and new. On my sweat-soaked outings I’ll see a unique porch, a curving roof, a well-preserved Tudor. My father was an architect, so it’s in my bones to be curious about the way houses are designed. That only sparks more questions: Should I stop? If I do, how close should I get? How long should I linger? What will the neighbours think?Then there’s my iPhone. To some, snapping off a few frames with a cellphone camera makes me look like a prowler. Cellphones can also be mistaken for guns. Not a chance I’m pulling it out.A few years ago, on a run about 10 minutes from my house, I stopped briefly in the middle of a street to tell a white homeowner how much I admired the minimalist fence that led up her stairs. She was in her yard. I was 20 feet away, sure to smile, and to not move any closer. I immediately saw worry in her eyes. She backed up a few steps. Someone bolted out from her front door, sceptical and scowling, as if I were an attacker.I turned back to pounding the pavement, imagining what the reaction would have been if I were blue-eyed and blonde.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

My family helped integrate this area and its schools, starting in the 1950s. And these days, the block where I live is a place where I feel great care. (It’s away from that block, on less familiar streets, when my radar rises.) So I gave a chagrined laugh at what had just taken place. It’s all we can do sometimes. Smile against the pain and disappointment, reminding ourselves that it’s about more than us in any one moment – it’s about a tangled and brutal 401-year history.But this day was different. Earlier, after watching the horrific video of the killing in Georgia, I’d collapsed on our couch, tears in my eyesThat legacy is what I thought of when my son asked whether we could run through his favourite neighbourhood. It’s adjacent to ours, a bit north and a lot more upscale. One of those gilded, set-apart communities with a homeowners’ association and lawns that look like putting greens. It doesn’t seem to have any trees on the sidewalk strips, so when I run there I feel as if I am in a fishbowl. Everyone can see us. I’ve never seen another black person in that neighbourhood.It’s a beautiful place, no doubt. My son loves it mainly for its wide, lightly travelled streets. They’re ideal for jogging, especially now. “Dad, can we go there?”We’d been doing just that on occasion over the past few weeks. But this day was different. Earlier, after watching the horrific video of the killing in Georgia, I’d collapsed on our couch, tears in my eyes.I don’t fear that neighbourhood, at least not any more than my own. But I can’t move through it without heads turning, without drawing objectifying smiles or looks that feel like doubt. I didn’t need to feel any of that.“We’re not going there on this run,” I said. “Some other time, I promise.”“Why?” he replied.“Have you ever seen any people of colour in that neighbourhood?” I asked. “It’s even more segregated than where we live. I’ll tell you more one day. Just not today.”My son managed a comforting smile. We turned the opposite direction, making the best of every moment, every stride, me with eyes wide open, him lopping along, content and carefree. It ends up being one of the best runs we’ve ever had.‘Turn down your music!’On the surface, Los Angeles is a mostly liberal town, but white privilege runs deep. I was verbally assaulted by a white man while on a morning run. I’ve been dreading the moment I might run into him again, wondering if he will be emboldened by our encounter.I haven’t stopped running on that trail, and I don’t plan to. The only thing that’s changed is I now run with pepper spray.In 2017, my wife and I moved to suburban Columbus, Ohio. About two weeks after we moved, I was running in the morning down neighbouring streets, trying to establish new routes. A woman who was leaving her home and getting into a car in her driveway did not notice me until I was nearing her driveway. I keep keys in my pocket so I can be heard.When the woman finally noticed me, she let out a gasp and said, “I’ve got mace.” I kept my pace and continued to run in a straight path. By the time I was at her driveway she was reaching inside her bag and screaming, “I’ll mace you.” I passed her without changing my speed or deviating from the run. Then I just went home.For the past week or so, I can’t help but think of how close I was to being assaulted on the same block where white men are freely able to walk around carrying weapons.Every single time I step out my door to run alone I create a “What If” checklist. What if someone tries to run me over, what if someone pulls up next to me to yell at me, what if someone tries to pull me into a vehicle? I have a plan just in case one of those “what if” moments were to occur.I have my phone tracker on and have all photos and videos taken on my phone automatically uploaded to three different cloud platforms. I have given some friends and family access to my tracker so they can attempt to find me just in case something were to happen. And I am conscious of what I am wearing to make me not look as if I am “suspicious” or “not doing what I shouldn’t be doing”.I run more than 20 miles a week. And each mile is not a carefree mile. I carry the weight and burden of the fears of what may be a harmful or detrimental experience that is undocumented and unjustified.‘Even in my own neighbourhood, I fear’I’m a husband, the father of four beautiful daughters and in the army, so staying in running shape is not optional for me. I live in a gated community in the birthplace of the civil rights movement, but also the cradle of the Confederacy. There isn’t a day that goes by that I run and don’t think about safety.Even in my own neighbourhood, I fear. I think about how\u0026nbspTrayvon\u0026nbspMartin was in his own gated neighbourhood when he was followed and gunned downMost of the time I try to run in my army physical fitness uniform or bright clothes and a reflective belt. I always run with my phone just in case something happens. At least my family would know what happened to me if I could pull out my phone and record it.Even in my own neighbourhood, I fear. I think about how Trayvon Martin was in his own gated neighbourhood when he was followed and gunned down. When it starts to rain a little bit, as it did the night Trayvon was killed, I cut my run short because of what happened to him. I think, they won’t believe I’m just trying to run in the rain.There’s a lot of trucks here with Confederate flags similar to the one that followed and killed our dear brother Ahmaud Arbery. Unfortunately, there’s so much unwanted anxiety running while black, and it’s further exacerbated with this senseless murder. We want to make it home to our families.‘Did anyone else see that?’The worst of it came as we all went into shelter in place in Pennsylvania. All of our local running groups remind us to run early or late to avoid crowds. I unfortunately listened to that advice one morning and went for a three-mile run. Halfway through, as I turned around, there was a hunter green pickup truck stopped in the middle of the road. I found it bizarre and slowed my run to a trot. As I got closer, I noticed the truck was decorated with TrumpPence 2020 stickers, along with a Confederate flag. My stomach dropped and I felt panic run through my body as they revved their engine several times in the middle of the road. I looked for escape routes in case they tried to jump the curb to hit me. I decided to be brave and pretend they were not there.As I passed them, they turned a corner down the street. We all peered at each other, until turning the corner broke their gaze. It was so uncomfortable and so confusing. Did anyone else see that? (No – I was alone and the streets were empty.) What just happened? What was that? I told my boyfriend about it and haven’t shared that experience with anyone else since. I now choose to run during peak hours with my BFF, with enough people around – just in case.‘I don’t want you to shoot!’Before I step outside of the house, I run through the following set of questions: Is my beard too thick? Is it too dark outside? Am I dressed like a runner? Then, while on the run, I have to consider the following: Is my rap music too loud? Does my cap, worn backward, send the wrong message? Do I open up my stride now or wait until I get out of the neighbourhood and into the open roads so that I don’t appear to be “running away” from something or someone?Beyoncé urges George Floyd protesters to stay ‘aligned and focussed’John Boyega receives huge support from filmmakers after BLM speechBlackout Tuesday is over – now be prepared for the real hard workThen there is scenario-planning while running: If you see a white young woman on the same path, cross the street immediately and try not to make eye contact twice. If it’s a white older womanman on same path, wavenodsmile, cross street casually. If you’re running behind them and they don’t hear you, cough loudlyclear throat, cross street. If on a narrow sidewalk, always give way to walkersbikers and step into the grass or street even though you’ve shattered your ankle twice. Turn volume down on music when passing by neighbours. Need to be able to respond should they say something so as not to be profiled as an angry black man.I’ve been doing mental gymnastics while running since I was 16. I’m 37 now, and I’ll continue doing it for as long as I live. The truth is, I don’t really want to do any of those things, but sadly I’m too concerned with what would happen if I stopped. So at mile five, when I’m sucking wind, sweating profusely in sweltering heat with an elevated heart rate, you’ll always catch me across the street waving neurotically and smiling. Again, not because I want to, but because I don’t want you to shoot!Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The latest study, which involved 2,254 British adults, also revealed that around six in 10 people experienced worse sleep since lockdown began on 23 March.Charting Sweden’s no lockdown strategy“Nearly two-thirds of the UK public report some negative impact on their sleep from the Covid-19 crisis, clearly showing just how unsettling the pandemic and lockdown measures have been for a very large proportion of us,” said Professor Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Institute at King’s College London.“And this is clearly tied to both how stressful we’ve found the virus itself, and how much we fear the impact of the lockdown on our employment and finances.”Data gathered in April by wearable technology firm Withings showed that people in the UK had been sleeping for 15 minutes longer on average each day during the lockdown.France saw the biggest increase in daily sleep times, with the average person sleeping for an extra 20 minutes each night.These findings can be partly explained by people not having to commute to work due to either working from home or not working at all during lockdown.Similar data from fitness tracking firm Polar revealed that people in Germany are also sleeping for longer.A significant increase in sleep time was recorded by Polar’s sleep-tracking devices as lockdown measures were introduced in Germany on 22 March.Researchers at University College London (UCL) are currently studying the effects lockdowns are having on people’s mental health.Early results suggest that higher levels of anxiety and depression are linked to lockdown restrictions.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt is also sometimes called the Rose Moon in Europe due to its arrival coinciding with the blooming of rose flowers. Neither name is a reference to the colour of the actual moon, which will appear as any other full moon of the year.It may appear pink or red when it is close to the horizon, however, as it is viewed through a much thicker layer of the Earth’s atmosphere.The full moon also coincides with a penumbral lunar eclipse, whereby the Earth comes between the Sun and the moon and blocks some of the light. The reduction in light can result in a reddish tinge to the moon\u0027s appearance.Created with Sketch.Pink supermoon lights up the night sky: In pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.June’s full moon follows a succession of so-called supermoons, whereby the moon appears bigger and brighter in the sky.The rare event takes place when the moon is at its closest orbit to Earth, allowing a better view of its craters, basins and other features.Various apps are available to track the moon’s progress across the night sky, including Star Chart, Sky Safari and Skyview.Each give details about which direction the moon will rise and set, as well as which phase the moon is in on any given night.​How to take the perfect picture of the supermoonThis year has been full of astronomical events with the supermoons over the past few months and it doesn\u0027t end there. Tonight the rare Strawberry Moon will rise and be visible each night over this weekend, Zoltan Toth-Czifra, founder of star chart maker Under Lucky Stars, told The Independent.In the current climate, a lower than average level of pollution combined with a good weather forecast means the view will be even clearer.The weather forecast for Friday suggests that viewings of the Strawberry Full Moon may be interrupted, at least for some.The Met Office states there will be “sunny spells and showers for many, some heavy with isolated thunder Heavy rain and gales developing across northern Scotland, edging south later.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In April 2019, when Google+ was shuttered, the company said that the new tool would allow “people to have meaningful discussions and interactions across your organisation, helping keep everyone in the know and giving leaders the opportunity to connect with their employees.”It appears that Currents, which has been in beta testing for several months, will work akin to Facebook Workplace, a spin-off of the company’s social network for enterprise users.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn an email sent to G Suite administrators, as reported by The Register, Google said: “After Currents becomes generally available on July 6, 2020, your users and all of your organization’s existing Google+ content will be automatically transitioned to Currents. It may take up to 5 days for Currents to rollout to your organization.”“There will not be any downtime for users during this transition. Additionally, the new Currents mobile app will replace the Google+ iOS and Android mobile apps, which will no longer be supported. After July 6, 2020, it will not be possible to opt out of Currents or revert back to Google+.” Google postpones new Android update because \u0027now is not the time\u0027Existing plus.google links will continue to work, but will redirect to currents.google URLs.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAdditionally, the new advice by WHO suggested that people over 60, as well as those in high-risk groups, should wear medical grade masks in cases where social distancing isn\u0027t possible.However concern remains that masks may themselves introduce risk factors – including making people feel less inclined to continue other measures like social distancing and hand washing.Mr Tedros added: “Our guidance also explains how to use a mask safely. People can potentially infect themselves if they use contaminated hands to adjust a mask, or to repeatedly take it off and put it on, without cleaning hands in between.“Masks can also create a false sense of security, leading people to neglect measures such as hand hygiene and physical distancing. “I cannot say this clearly enough: masks alone will not protect you from Covid-19.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?The announcement comes just a day after the UK government announced it would be making face coverings mandatory on public transport following months of claims the science was not clear on their effectiveness.“We are advising governments to encourage that the general public wear a mask. And we specify a fabric mask – that is, a non-medical mask,” the WHO’s technical lead expert on Covid-19, Maria van Kerkhove, added. “We have evidence now that if this is done properly it can provide a barrier... for potentially infectious droplets.”The UN agency’s advice that all healthcare workers dealing with Covid-19 patients, or with suspected cases of the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, should wear medical masks remains the same, Ms Van Kerkhove said.However, now that advice has been broadened to suggest staff coming into contact with any patients or residents in clinics, hospitals, care homes and long-term residential facilities should also wear masks at all times.Additional reporting by Reuters.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These are some of the stories behind the statistics:Sharing the full story, not just the headlines‘I work so hard yet I can’t afford the basics’: The NHS worker with no support from the stateTheo Manugerwa was struggling before the coronavirus crisis began. The 47-year-old, who lives with her two daughters aged 12 and 10 in Leicester, has been working in the NHS for 11 years, but her immigration status means she has no recourse to public funds (NRPF) – meaning she cannot claim any form of state support. As a result, the single mother has always had to work overtime in order to afford rent and provide for her children.Since lockdown started, Theo has been unable to work the extra hours.Her children are still going to school as she is a key worker, but after-school clubs are no longer operating and the friends who used to look after them while she was at work are no longer able to, due to the lockdown.She says: “It has become very hard. Once I take off my rent, I’m left with nothing at all. It has always been difficult, from the day they gave me that NRPF condition, but at least I could get extra shifts here and there to put food on the table for my children.How to support our campaign“The money I’m making now is not enough to cater for the three of us. We are depending on charity. I’ve always been very proud. I didn’t want to give in and ask for help. The feeling when you walk into a food bank is very painful. I work so hard yet I can’t afford the basics.”Theo, a Ugandan national who moved to the UK 20 years ago, is due to apply for her next visa extension next month, at a cost of more than £2,000, and she says the thought of it makes her feel sick. The Home Office told The Independent it would help Theo apply to get access to benefits under measures introduced to tackle the pandemic. But for now, she has also fallen into rent arrears, and fears she is going to generate serious debt. “I just need some support. I have no support at all. You get tired of depending on people. You don’t want to keep telling people your problems. I feel undervalued as a health worker during this time.“I feel abandoned. I’ve always worked hard to provide for my children, but it makes me feel like I’ve let them down.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Both financially and mentally,” says Sian Abbott. The 28-year-old’s family of seven started using food banks about a year ago when her husband lost his job as a poultry farmer – and she says things have become even more difficult during the Covid-19 crisis.Sian, who lives in Pembrokeshire and has five children, aged between 10 and three, says: “Three weeks into the pandemic I had a breakdown. We ran out of food because the food bank people couldn’t get to us. I ended up reaching out to my church and they sent us an emergency supply package.“It’s stressful, especially with the school closures. At least when the kids were in school they were able to get a meal. My husband and I go without meals sometimes so the children can eat.”Sian, who previously worked as a taxi controller and a carer but had to stop working to look after her autistic son, says she has noticed a lot more people who didn’t previously use food banks are now turning to them, but worries that the supply isn’t there.“In the supermarkets there used to be trolleys full of donations, but now there’s barely one. Prices are higher. The cost of nappies have nearly doubled, which is really difficult for us,” she adds.“It’s funny because when we first heard about food banks six years ago we were donating to them – usually around £50 or £60 a week – but now we’re having to rely on them ourselves.”Zoe Green and her husband David are “really struggling financially” for the very first time. The couple and their four children – aged from two to 11 – now depend on a weekly parcel from a food bank based at their local school in north London, a project supplied with fresh produce by The Felix Project charity.Ms Green, a 36-year-old freelancer who worked in TV and documentary production, hasn’t been able to find any work over the past few months. She received less than £1,000 pounds for a three-month period after applying for the government’s self-employment income support scheme.Although 39-year-old Mr Green still gets around £400 a month while on furlough from his part-time retail job, the couple have found they have a shortfall of around £300 a month for household bills. This is being met by The Film and TV Charity, but the couple do not know how long the emergency stipend will last.“It’s not been an easy time – we’ve never known food poverty until the coronavirus hit,” she said. “When we got the first food package from The Felix Project, I was literally crying as I took out all the fresh food. The work they and the other charities are doing right now is really, really appreciated. I never thought we’d need it.”“I’m really hoping the government will extend the self-employment scheme. I’m also hoping they might factor out the periods I was on maternity leave and wasn’t able to earn as much, so I can get a higher average amount.”‘Food banks have been a godsend’: Self-employed mother who isn’t eligible for government support Susan, 45, said she found herself in financial difficulty in the months before the pandemic after her fledging health drink business collapsed.The children going hungry during the coronavirus pandemicFood bank demand soars as newly unemployed wait weeks for benefitsAlthough she set herself up as a private education tutor in February 2020, she found she wasn’t eligible to apply for the government’s self-employment income support scheme after lockdown began.“I struggled to be able to buy food during the lockdown, as I’d lost income and also fell through the government net,” said the west Londoner. “It made a difficult situation even more difficult.”She and her two children, aged 10 and 12, are now relying on a weekly food bank set up at the Bollo Brook Youth Centre on her south Acton estate. “The children being at home is tough to manage. It’s stressful trying to keep up with it all and help with their school work whilst worrying about bills,” she said.“We’ve been fortunate and receive help with food that we would not have been able to buy. It’s been godsend to get us through this time until we can rebuild our lives back to normal.”‘It’s a battle to keep going’: Food bank manager whose demand is up tenfoldOriginally set up to provide support for single fathers, the Dads House charity now runs food banks for anyone in financial need at two sites in west and south London.Founder Billy McGranaghan said he and his volunteers saw between 30 and 50 people looking for help each day before the pandemic, but in the past couple of months demand for food parcels has shot up tenfold to between 300 and 500 people a day.“It’s heartbreaking to see the long queues,” he said. “The volume is something we’ve never seen before. It’s poverty like you’ve never seen. People tell us they’ve got £20 or £30 to get through the week. Some are telling us they’re having to sell possessions or borrow money from loan sharks.”Mr McGranaghan added: “Some people had been in very casual work before the crisis – bar staff, nannies, cleaners. So there’s no furloughing going on to help them. But in many cases they’re not necessarily self-employed either – they were dependant on that weekly wage. So they’re not eligible for the government self-employed scheme.”The food bank founder said many people were applying for universal credit, but they are forced to face at least five weeks before any money appears in their bank account.“I’m just hoping some people are able to get back into work when the shops re-open in a couple of weeks,” he said. “But at the moment it’s a battle for people to keep going.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Everyone is very grateful,’ says a volunteer who also uses service when his own illness means he is unable to pitch inFormer music manager John McIntyre was unsure how he would cope when lockdown began.“I was very scared,” said the 75-year-old who has a respiratory condition and lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Dalston. “If I caught Covid, I wouldn’t be able to get enough oxygen to the heart. I just had to follow the advice and be safe.” Mr McIntyre, who used to manage the jazz reggae band The Beatroots, has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema.He has relied for his daily meal from local charity Made In Hackney which is supplied by our Help the Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project. Mr McIntyre is one of more than two million people who are classified as “extremely vulnerable” because they have compromised immune systems. For the last 10 weeks, many of them have struggled to get access to food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince March, volunteers from the River House Trust charity have been dropping off Felix produce to people living with HIV. One such volunteer is former actor Stephen Hart who was diagnosed in 2006. When he is too ill to leave the house, he also uses the food delivery service.Despite being high-risk and a life-long diabetic, Mr Hart has been helping to get food to those more vulnerable than him. He has been unable to work since his health deteriorated two years ago, but Mr Hart, who lives alone in south London, said he wanted to help others.How to support our campaign“When I feel well enough, I pick up boxes from River House and drop them off for people who need them,” he said. “I do it when I can but some days are bad days.”Mr Hart said his condition means sometimes he can’t get out of bed. He occasionally receives a Felix box for himself so he knows he has food when he is too sick to move. “It is reassuring to have food in the house,” he said. “Felix has been a lifeline.”Although the British HIV Association said there “remains no evidence” that people with HIV are at greater risk of Covid-19 infection, those with a low CD4 count – the white blood cells affected by HIV – have been advised to shield.Mr Hart said members of the HIV community have been “nervous” since the outbreak. “There isn’t much specific advice so the community has been trying to look after each other.”A 62-year-old living with HIV for 37 years, who asked not to be named, described how his parcels have helped him. He said: “I pick up the boxes as I don’t have energy to go shopping. They’ve been great.”Mr Hart said it was extremely moving to see the response to his deliveries: “It is amazing. Everyone is very grateful.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

If we are going to have decisions being taken that affect the regions, surely the voice of the English regions should be represented there?” he told BBC Breakfast.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There is an awful long way to go.”The critical R (reproduction) rate – where a figure above 1 means the coronavirus will spread exponentially – was “creeping close to 1” or even “at around 1” in some regions, such as the northwest.Mr Hancock, speaking on the BBC’s programme The Andrew Marr Show, denied that the lockdown had been imposed too late, while declining to dispute whether the timing had “cost lives”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.All 5.7 million inhabitants of Singapore could be issued with a wearable contact-tracing device under new plans to combat coronavirus.The gadget can be worn on a lanyard or carried loose. It is designed to bypass glitches in an earlier smartphone-based system that used Bluetooth and had limited uptake – difficulties also experienced by other governments including the UK.Singapore has one of the highest coronavirus caseloads in Asia and is one of many countries trying find a technological solution that will allow it to ease restrictions on activity. The government did not specify whether carrying the device will be mandatory if it is distributed to the whole population.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“We are developing and will soon roll out a portable wearable device that will not depend on possession of a smartphone,” Vivian Balakrishnan, the minister in charge of the city-state’s smart nation initiative said on Friday.“If this portable device works, we may then distribute it to everyone in Singapore.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?The government’s earlier TraceTogether app was downloaded by about 1.5 million people, but hit snags especially on Apple devices whose operating systems suspend Bluetooth scanning when the app runs in the background.“We’ve had repeated discussions both at the technical and policy level with Apple, but we have not yet been able to find a satisfactory solution,” Mr Balakrishnan said.The pivot to wearables suggests Singapore, like Britain, has no immediate plans to adopt contact-tracing tech that Apple and Google rolled out last month, which has several restrictions designed to protect users’ privacy.Singapore has not provided details on the technology that will be used in the new wearable devices. However, analysts believe it may face similar challenges to its predecessor.“The government would likely have to mandate the use of such a device for the system to be effective, which is something that few countries have done so far,” said Frederic Giron, a Singapore-based analyst from market research company Forrester.Many experts have raised privacy concerns about contact tracing devices.

It seems that Wolverine’s ties to Adamantium, the Vibranium-associated alloy his claws are made out from, could be what brings him to Wakanda.Every Avengers character ranked from worst to bestEverything we know about Disney+’s The Falcon and the Winter SoldierHow to watch every Marvel film and TV show in chronological orderOne theory suggests that we’ll meet Wolverine early on in his mutant days as he searches for the meaning behind his creation. It could be that Shuri (Letitia Wright) explains the science behind his origins to him. There have been numerous rumours surrounding the X-Men’s arrival in the MCU. One report suggested their induction could clash with the return of the Avengers in a film that would not be released until Phase Six, which is expected to begin in the mid-2020s.Other reports predicted Wolverine will appear as early as Phase 5.It looks like plans to execute their induction is underway, though. A recent leaked image from the set of Disney+ TV show The Falcon and the Winter Soldier featured an emblem of a location integral to the X-Men comic books: the flag of Madripoor. Created with Sketch.Marvel films – ranked worst to best Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, Avengers Assemble still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all.  5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

During the Troubles, around , people were killed in the Province and very many more injured.Reliable statistics show that % of the deaths were caused by terrorists .Less than  per cent of those who were killed between  and  were at the hands of the police and the military and of these, with a handful of exceptions, all were found to be lawful.There is no getting away from the fact that the vast majority of soldiers in Northern Ireland got up in the morning with a clear aim to abide by the Law and fulfil their duties with integrity.Terrorists, on the other hand, got up in the morning with the clear aim to kill and to maim, for purely political purposes.So, what is to be done  Accepting that no one is above the Law and that where credible allegations, backed by evidence, are made against anyone, then charges must be laid, a case heard in court and a proper finding reached.This applies to soldiers and to civilians alike. And there are still unexplained deaths in Northern Ireland. But for investigations to focus unduly on former soldiers is grossly unfair. The British Army kept detailed records of who was where, doing what on a given date.None of the paramilitaries, the IRA nor the UVF or UDA, kept such records, so starting with inquiries first to soldiers, while logical to the police mind, is thoroughly unreasonable and very worrying,done in the wrong way with an unexpected knock on the door.It is for that reason that the former Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox MP, proposed that such questioning should be on the presumption not to prosecute. In this way soldiers can be invited to provide information but without the fear that they will incriminate themselves or their comrades.Families of the bereaved have the right to know what happened to their loved ones but not at the expense of stress and worry to  and -year-old former soldiers. That offends natural justice and must stop.On my last morning as Chief of the General Staff on th August , two investigators presented themselves in my office in the Ministry of Defence to ask about a death in Belfast in . This was nothing more than a fishing trip and quite unacceptable.In the United Kingdom, we are justiably proud of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. They take risks on the front line to protect our national interests and citizens at home and abroad.They are trained to follow core values of selfless commitment, courage, discipline, integrity, loyalty and respect for others. They go about their duties with these values very much in mind.They deserve the respect of the country and the support of the elected Government of the day whose operations they conduct on behalf of the people. They do not deserve to be accused and harassed years later.I am delighted that the appalling IHAT is now itself part of history, so too must be the witch hunt of former soldiers who did their duty in Northern Ireland.

Local businesses that rely on tourists desperately want to re-open.“But until the government listens to frontline professionals with the expertise to hunt the coronavirus down they are risking a catastrophic spike in infections that would risk lives and jobs.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The shining light in all of the darkness has been their twins Sean and Amelie, who are now almost  years old.They were just babies when Madeleine went missing, and although she hasn’t been in their lives for the past  years, they have had to grow up in their big sister’s shadow.Kate and Gerry are fiercely protective of the pair, and have tried to shield them from the outside world, especially the fetid online swamp of vindictive attention-seekers and conspiracy theorists.It can’t be easy trying to allow them to lead a normal le, while wanting to wrap them both in cotton wool and keep them safe.Any time I have offered this poor, bereft couple support, I experience a tiny pinprick of the kind of horric agony they have to endure.All I have to do is spend a few hours muting the vile trolls so they are effectively ranting in an empty room.Kate and Gerry are engulfed by a tsunami of prejudice and hatred every time Madeleine is back in the news.It’s already started up again.The next few days, weeks and months will open a lot of old wounds for Madeleine’s parents.They will have to relive the very bleakest times of their lives, and their hearts will be broken in pieces all over again.We all wanted Madeleine to be found alive, and for the family to have the chance to heal together.Realistically that’s not going to happen.But I hope to God they will finally find out what happened to their little girl and at least be able to mourn her.And then, somehow, try to get on with the rest of their lives.WHAT on earth was going through the head of racist cop Derek Chauvin as he snuffed the le out of George Floyd He must have realised the poor man couldn’t breathe and was close to death.Chauvin was also fully aware his actions were being filmed on a number of mobile phones, but he continued to forcibly put pressure on Mr Floyd’s neck and throat.Chauvin, who has been charged with second degree murder, displayed the most supreme arrogance.We can only surmise he feels himself to be above the law.I couldn’t watch the footage of a man dying before my eyes and I absolutely understand the despair and anger in the US, from everyone sick to their stomachs.Those who cry that Mr Floyd was a criminal are missing the point.Black men in the US are ASSUMED to be law breakers.They are stopped and searchedthey drive a half-decent car, and treated like dirt.They have to prove to cops they have nothing to hide while young white boys are not subjected to such prejudice.And it’s not all that much better on this side of the Atlantic.I absolutely understand the despair and anger following Mr Floyd’s death, and although I can sympathise, as a white person I can’t begin to understand what it’s really like because I don’t live with racism every day of my le.I completely respect people’s right to demonstrate and their heartfelt need to express solidarity with Mr Floyd and his family and to draw a line in the sand.At the same time I was deeply worried by the mass gatherings of people right in the middle of this pandemic, and concerned for their safety. You simply cannot have protests while observing social distancing.People were angry and upset and trying to comfort each other with embraces and hugs.There were confrontations with authorities – with police and protesters standing eyeball to eyeball.In London we saw isolated incidents of violence but most of the protesters were peaceful.They were, however, just too close to one another.And it would be an enormous tragedywe were to see a spike or second wave of coronavirus because of the heinous actions of one US cop.I really hope the killing of George Floyd is a turning point and there is some sort of common ground where people, regardless of their colour, start talking to each other to achieve a greater understanding.While we have a sour, embittered man in the White House who is using Mr Floyd’s death as a way to ide the nation and to further his bid for re-election, I seriously doubt any progress will be made, but we all need to try.I AM a huge admirer of Kate Middleton, who has the future of the Royal Family on her slender shoulders.She is never going to be a charismatic force of nature. But I don’t think that’s a bad thing – and not what we really want from our royals in any case.Kate is kind, hardworking, elegant and classy.  She takes her duties seriously and tries to help her chosen charities with an admirably hands-on approach.She is a loving mum, sweet-natured, reliable and loyal.This has led to some people accusing her of being rather dull.And she has been the subject of a snarky article in Tatler magazine, which claimed she has felt exhausted and trapped in the Royal Family ever since Harry and Meghan decide to run for the Hollywood hills.Kate is also dismissed as having “an aura of blandness” and accused of having acquired a much posher accent over the years.Kate was so incensed by this article she has taken legal action against the posh publication, claiming a string of inaccuracies – including a pre-wedding spat with her sister-in-law just before Meghan’s wedding to Harry.Incredibly, Tatler claims the pair fell out over whether Kate’s daughter Princess Charlotte should wear tights or not on the big day.It has all proved too much for Kate.She wants the world to realise she is not some sort of magnolia blancmange and to prove she is no pushover by demanding the offending article be removed.Kate might be quiet but she is also grimly determined.I suspect copies of Tatler will be airbrushed from all royal residences forthwith, never to darken their gilded coffee tables again.BIG congrats to the cast and crew of Holby City, who are up for a well-deserved Bafta in the Best Soap  Continuing Drama category.Much like late, lamented police drama The Bill, Holby has been shamefully overlooked and underrated when it comes to awards and recognition.The cast – in particular Rosie Marcel, as Jac Naylor, Bob Barrett as Sacha Levy and Kaye Wragg as Essie di Lucca – consistently put in cracking performances and the whole show just quietly gets on with knocking it out of the park week after week.I’d dearly love to see them taking home a Bafta,only to flag to BBC bosses what a gem of a show they have on their hands.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All the other drivers on the motorway could see it too. But the Tesla, bombing along at around mph, with its self-drive autopilot system engaged, did NOT see it.It even went straight past the driver of the overturned truck who was at the side of the road, a good distance from the crash site, frantically warning oncoming motorists to slow down. And then came the impact.Luckily, no one was hurt. But the accident does serve as a useful reminder about technology. It can make le fun and it can make le convenient. But we’ve not yet reached a point where we can rely on it to behave itself. Take the wi in your house.The box sits in a cupboard, I should imagine, where there’s no wind or rain or weather of any kind. It is never bashed or dropped. And yet somehow, once a fortnight, it will suddenly stop working. There is no reason for this.In my London flat, the windows also serve as radiators. They are designed to come on in October and go off again in April.But every year, they get it the wrong way round and no one is able to stop them doing this, boiling me in the summer and sitting there in the winter while I slowly die of hypothermia.My laptop is no better. The last one became critically ill recently, so before it died completely, all of its information was transferred on to the model I’m using now.And that, about once a day, decides to freeze. Control-Alt-Delete  Forget it. It becomes as receptive as a brick. We have all experienced these things. And we have to believe the owner of that Tesla in Taiwan has as well.Yet he engaged the car’s self-drive system and sat back, assuming it would be able to see a crashed van directly ahead. Had he not researched the car at all  I know Tesla says its autonomous system is nine times safer than a human. But a quick Google search would suggest that sometimes, like all technology, it isn’t safe at all.I actually quite like Tesla’s current range of cars. I think they are interesting and fun and I can see why, in lockdown, the Model  was the best-selling car in Britain. But I have a word of warning for anyone tempted to buy one and engage its autopilot: Don’t.Think of it as the tool you get on a Swiss Army kne that can be used for getting stones out of a horse’s hoof. It’s a talking point . . . but you’d never actually use it.IT has been the biggest police manhunt in history. But now, after a multimillion-pound, -year search across  countries, there appears to be a genuine breakthrough in the search for Madeleine McCann.That’s great. But what staggers me is that the new chief suspect Christian B was living just a few miles from the Portuguese resort where she was last seen. His phone puts him in the resort itself on the night of the abduction.He was even interviewed by Plod back in . And it’s not like he was a model citizen. Described as a burglar and a drug dealer, it’s known he was also a paedophile. He’s even doing time in Germany right now for child sex offences. And yet somehow he was never arrested.It makes me wonder. Will they find Lord Lucan living next door to the house from which he fled in  And will it turn out that “Mr Herring” who rides around Fulham every day on a horse called Shiregar is actually the mysterious Mr Kipper who is said to have abducted Suzy Lamplugh back in  THE Hungarian justice minister Judit Varga responded angrily this week to claims her country had become a dictatorship.I’m not sure what she said, though.

She does to me what our Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, does for the girls.“I don’t care what you’re saying just so long as you keep on saying it.”At a rough guess, I’d say  per cent of everything on the internet is wrong.WHEN London was brought to its knees by a plague in the th century, a young man called Isaac Newton fled to the countryside and while in quarantine, came up with a cure.Recently unearthed papers show how he figured out the Black Death could be beaten with a medicine made from a powdered toad and some of its vomit.After it turned out this didn’t work, he went for a sit down in an orchard, where he saw an apple fall from a tree . . .THE the last-ever .-litre Bentley V rolled off the production line this week.

The more people there are, the more food there is for the rats.”Female rats can fall pregnant immediately after giving birth and can produce seven litters per year with up to eight babies each time.They can also mate up to  times with randy males in the space of a few hours.Professor Steven Belmain, of Natural Resources Institute in Greenwich, has also recorded an increase in rodents in suburban homes which he blames on a lack of food in city centres.He also said that hunger has made the ravenous rats more brazen meaning they are seen more and more during the day.Speaking about the rats fighting each other, he said: “They are quite territorial, so will defend their patches as much as they can.”While rats do not carry Covid-, they can spread other zoonotic diseases including Weil’s disease – a bacterial infection which can cause chills and headaches.Professor Belmain believes that while some of the vermin will migrate back to the cities once the lockdown is over, many colonies will continue to expand in the suburbs.He said: “What is happening is they are moving into residential areas and finding food sources there, so deciding to make it home.“Some people are telling me they are having real problems.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Water companies have the power to impose restrictions on how households can use water in times of serious shortage.Providers are meant to cut the following years bills by a reasonable amount to compensate for the limited supply during any ban.The shortages are almost always caused due to a below average amount of rainfall.A drought is when there is an exceptional period of low rainfall - causing reservoirs to run dry.There are currently no hosepipe bans in the UK but hot weather experienced in the UK during May and forecast into June may mean a ban could be imposed at a later date.

Writing in the study, which is published on research site arXiv, Professor Simon Wood claimed the most Covid- deaths were recorded on April . Dr Woodaposs model found patients would have been first infected around March  - - four days before the UK went into lockdown, Bristol Live reports.Using data from a study of Chinese patients, Dr Wood said the average death from the virus takes around . days from when they first experience symptoms. Some signs such as a new persistent cough, a fever and a loss of taste or smell were found to have appeared around . days after contracting Covid- with an average incubation period of  days. In the week before full lockdown measures were rolled out, the government launched a public information campaign urging people to wash their hands and keep two metres away from others. Dr Wood said that some social distancing was happening “might have done the trick” but it was dficult to be certain when infections actually peaked in the UK because widespread testing was abandoned by the Government in mid-March. He said: Indeed the failure to undertake the sampling that could have gathered data to directly measure infections early in the epidemic means that it will never be possible to be certain about timings, given the severe biases in clinical data other than deaths and fatal disease duration.  What the results show is that, in the absence of strong assumptions, the currently most reliable data strongly suggest that the decline in infections in England and Wales began before lockdown. Furthermore, such a scenario would be consistent with the infection profile in Sweden, which began its decline in fatal infections shortly after the UK, but did so on the basis of measures well short of lockdown. He added: These facts have implications for the policies to be adopted in the coming autumn, particularly given the peculiar ethical issues associated with lockdown. For example, plausible estimates of the le loss burden from an unmitigated Covid- epidemic in the UK are about two weeks per person.  A plausible lower bound on the UK le loss from the  financial crisis and its aftermath is seven weeks per person. The economic shock from lockdown is substantially larger than . Last month the Government rolled out its trace and test programme as it eased the lockdown across England.The system aims to find out how and where coronavirus is spreading by testing people with symptoms.Experts have identied  ­possible symptoms but only those with one out of three are to be tested. These are a fever, cough or loss of taste or smell – which chief medical officer Chris Whitty says covers “ per cent” of cases.  But other medics have rubbished his claim ­because those with other ­widely reported symptoms such as tiredness will miss out. It means many could have the virus without knowing and pass it on.

Demonstrations have erupted against police brutality after the death of George Floyd. A police officer pinned his neck under a knee for nearly nine minutes in Minneapolis on May . Ms Nandy told the BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show: I think itaposs one of the most important things about living in a free society is that people can go out and protest. Iaposve said repeatedly that it must be safe, people should social distance - please take precautions - but Iaposm very proud of those young people who are coming out and speaking up.  Ms Nandy also appealed to the small number of people who have used violence at the Black Lives Matter protests to stop. She added it was completely wrong to attack police officers, many of whom are deeply sympathetic with the sentiment behind these protests, who are struggling as well to deal with Covid and help to keep public order in a really unprecedented situation, and would undermine the message protests want to send.Ms Nandy said she has no idea whether Donald Trump is a racist or not a racist.But she warned his attacks on Black Lives Matter protesters were a deliberate election strategy, with right-wingers trying to ide people in order to try to advance their own cause.  She said: Thataposs crept into our politics in Britain in the last few years and weaposre seeing under the cover of Covid, other countries trying to do something similar - rowing back on peopleaposs freedoms, human rights, the rule of law, democracy. And thataposs one of the reasons why Iaposve said this Government cannot remain silent in the face of that. The UK government has condemned appalling scenes in the US but so far has not criticised Donald Trump directly. Health Secretary Matt Hancock today said there was undoubtedly a risk the protests would make an increase of Covid- more likely.  He told Sky News: “I support very strongly the argument that is being made by those who are protesting for more equality and against discrimination. “But the virus itself doesn’t discriminate and gathering in large groups is temporarily against the rules precisely because it increases the risk of the spread of this virus. “So I would urge people to make their argument and I will support you in making that argument.But please don’t spread this virus. Prof John Edmunds, a member of the government’s scientic advice group SAGE, also said there is a risk the protests could spread the virus. He said it is mitigated by being outside and people wearing masks, but not eliminated. “If you have a crowd of a few thousand people then you would expect some of those people to be infectious,” he told the BBC. “Of course it does carry some risk unfortunately.” Mr Hancock insisted I donapost think Britain is a racist country - and tried to defend the lack of black people in Cabinet.

An exclusive Sunday Mirror poll by Redfield  Wilton Strategies shows  per cent favour the move, which starts tomorrow, despite devastating effects on our airline and tourism sectors. Garry Graham, of the skilled workers’ union Prospect warned: “This will be a further body blow to the aviation industry. The policy is political and not based on the scientic evidence or advice.” But Home Secretary Priti Patel said: “The new public health measures at the border are essential to protect the hard-won progress we have made and help prevent a second wave.” And  per cent of voters think the ban on Brits travelling to even countries with low levels of corona should continue,  per cent more than those who say it should be lted. Boris Johnson is slammed by  per cent for easing lockdown too quickly as confidence in his handling of the crisis plummets. His standing has fallen from  to  per cent in a month while Labour leader Keir Starmer’s is up five points.  More than seven in  say the PM should have fired top aide Dominic Cummings for flouting lockdown by driving his family  miles to Durham.And four in  reckon his response to the pandemic has been awful. Nearly half think he is not ready for a second wave. Six in  voters say the disease will only be beaten when a vaccine is available.

While most primary schools across England reopened last week plans to reopen high schools on Monday are being shelved due to fears over the coronavirus infection rates. Now it has been claimed that some secondary schools might not fully re-open until next year and the impact could hit exam season yet again. It comes as Dr Gavin Morgan, who sits on the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , said keeping pupils out of school was  per cent worse for them than coronavirus.He told the : “We know they have a less challenging diseasethey do pick it up... The impact on children is miniscule in terms of their health.” Exam regulator Ofqual has begun making contingency plans as pupils try to claw back months of lost learning due to the lockdown, The Sunday Times reports. The regulator is considering pushing aposs exams from May to as late as July and continuing this summeraposs emergency marking system. An Ofqual spokeswoman told the PA news agency that the regulator recognised pupils, parents and teachers were concerned about disruptions caused by the pandemic. She said: Our overriding aim is to ensure exams and assessments are as fair as possible and we are working closely with the Department for Education, exam boards and groups representing teachers, schools and colleges, to carefully consider a range of possible measures. We will provide further information in the coming weeks.  The Department for Education said: “We expectexams to take place next year and are working with Ofqualand the exam boards.” In a letter last week, Andrew Halls, headmaster at King’s College School, a private school in Wimbledon, southwest London, said: “Some children, though it is impossible to say what proportion, may not be back in school until January .” While Vic Goddard, chief executive of Passmores, an academy trust in Essex, wrote to parents confirming children will attend school on a rota basis, and hopes all pupils will be back by November this year.

But they are not the only casualties in the war against corona. Another is the truth. It takes some gall for Boris Johnson and his ministers to boast how well they are handling this crisis when the figures and daily revelations of cackhanded planning say otherwise. The highest official death toll in Europe, and an estimated , in care homes. Fewer tests proportionately than Belgium, Russia, Portugal and Spain. More than two million jobs lost with no indication from the PM of how he will stop that doubling. Locking down too late and easing it too early. No coherent proposal to get schools fully up and running. Reduced classes mean they are already at  per cent capacity. And without a plan for schools, there can be none for parents to get back to work. The British people now know that when Mr Johnson blusters that he has a world-beating this or a globe-leading that, nothing could be further from the truth. When a carefully considered programme for recovery is most needed, policy is made on the hoof. Health Secretary Matt Hancock failed to tell NHS staff they would need to wear surgical masks before announcing it. Today we compile the full charge sheet against the Prime Minister. And to that we should add the one of perjury for all the lies he has told. No government can be expected to get everything right when faced with an unexpected and unprecedented pandemic. But the governments of other countries clearly got more right than our own. Their lower death figures prove it. Boris Johnson failed us when the World Health Organisation said we must test, test, test. The least we deserved from him was truth, truth, truth. An admission that he was wrong is what is needed now. A little humility would not go amiss. Becausewe are to defeat this dreadful disease, we must have confidence in our leaders so we can do it together. The British lion needs its strength more than ever. It should not be led by donkeys. Bias must end Black Lives Matter. That should go without saying, of course. Yet it is an indictment of our society that it still needs to be said by protesters in Britain and all over the world following George Floyd’s death. Even in this country, police are more than twice as likely to have used force in deaths involving those from BAME groups.

Now, she’s joined by husband of  years Martin, also , to raise funds for Born Free, a charity which protects animals from illegal trade and poaching worldwide. She and Martin have pledged to raise as much money as possible during lockdown, undertaking a km ‘fast trot’ around Hampstead Heath in London, near their home, every day for the next two months. ‘We were of course inspired by Captain Tom raising £ million for the NHS from walking in his garden, which we think is very admirable,’ she smiles. ‘But it was hearing all about the horrors of the wet markets in China that really shocked me,’ explains Angela. ‘It was a no-brainer to try and help as much as we could.’ A long-term supporter of Born Free, Angela joined as a fundraiser  years ago when the charity was named Zoo Check and they focused primarily on the treatment of animals in zoos across the world. Through her work she’s become very close with the founder, Virginia McKenna. ‘I got to know Virginia over the years and through our friendship I made another friend, Jill Robinson, who founded the charity Animals Asia,’ she says. ‘Martin and I headed to China to celebrate our th wedding anniversary  years ago and we stayed with Jill. She took us to see the bears she had rescued. It was fantastic to see.’ Angela went on to explain how Virginia also went to stay with Jill and the pair decided to visit the notorious live animal markets for themselves. They were horried by what they saw. ‘When Virginia called me to tell me all about it, it was much worse than anyone could have imagined,’ she says sadly. ‘There were monkeys, puppies, peacocks, badgers, all sorts, all being chopped up alive or blow torched to death – I believed it to be the cruellest thing I’d ever heard towards animals. aposVirginia had seen monkeys on chains, cowering in fear knowing they were next to be killed. Plus, I found out that in China alone there are approximately , factory farms breeding exotic animals for this trade. It is absolutely awful.’  Four months ago, Angela was invited to have lunch with Virginia and a few other loyal supporters, lovingly known as ‘Virginia’s circle’. It was there that the Born Free organisation realised they had to do something about the state of the markets now more than ever. Some evidence points towards these wildle markets being the birthplace of the Covid- pandemic. ‘It isn’t just the treatment of the animals which is appalling,’ explains Angela, ‘but the amount of blood, faeces and infection that is spread at the markets links directly to being a human health hazard,’ she tells us, reflecting on the pandemic. ‘People have died, lost their jobs, had to mourn loved ones from afar. It’s the most devastating thing in my letime, almost as bad as the Second World War, which I lived through,’ she says solemnly. ‘Hearing about the markets was enough to make me want to raise some money, but when Virginia said she’d also seen a group of women outside the markets in China casually throwing live kittens into a huge vat of boiling hot oil while they played cards well, I was devastated. aposI offered up me and Martin walking to raise funds and they jumped at the idea.’ Although Angela and Martin had always enjoyed a small stroll in the mornings, there was an even bigger challenge ahead. Martin is completing the walk while he recovers from the open-heart surgery he had last year.  ‘He was lucky he’d always played golf and walked so he was fit enough to have the operation,’ she explains. ‘They won’t usually do it on most people his age. But as part of the healing process he was asked to stay active. The only change is that we now use walking poles. They really help propel us up and down the hills!’ she smiles. ‘We both have our marbles and we’re still up and running, well…’ she pauses, ‘walking! So although we won’t raise as much as Captain Tom, we’ve raised £, in the first three weeks. But the money has stopped, so anything anyone can donate is a huge help,’ she adds. The pair do enjoy their walks and have a lovely routine which makes the route extra pleasurable. ‘Being so old, and with my husband having a bad back, we walk at a steady pace,’ she tells us. ‘We take coffee in a flask which goes in my backpack and we’ve found a lovely scenic route round the park which has bluebells, beautul foxgloves, all sorts. It’s so quiet and peaceful there and not noisy. So we usually walk for  minutes, take a little seat and have our coffee and then it takes us about  minutes to walk back.’ And of course, it’s always safety first. ‘We wash our hands as soon as we get in and I disinfect the soles of our shoes and walking poles,’ she adds.  While outdoor activity has been a welcome relief for the nation during lockdown, Angela and Martin are often met by local supporters, including some very famous faces. ‘Some of our friends in the area met us at the coffee stop point for a quick natter – from a distance, of course!’ she confirms. ‘But as we were speaking I spotted someone walking past. aposI said to my friends, “Is that Michael Palin ” and low and behold he cupped his hands together and shouted over to me, “Yes, it is!” Me being silly shouted back, “The real Michael Palin ” and he laughed and shouted, “Yes, of course!” aposI asked for a picture but he said absolutely not! It wasn’t going to be easy at a  metre distance,’ she laughs. ‘It was a rather funny encounter.’ Angela and Martin also regularly see another famous face on their walks, and they’re fortunate enough to class this one as a close friend. ‘Ricky Gervais is always out walking and we know him well,’ she smiles. ‘When we chat I hold my pole up to keep the distance between us,’ she says with a cheeky laugh. ‘He’s an animal activist like us and has supported us on our charity mission. Both Martin and I loved After Le and it’s filmed where we walk so I asked him to take a picture of me and him on the churchyard bench he sits on in the series alongside Penelope Wilton. aposI said to him that I was the replacement for series  which he found very funny. He’s so lovely.’  Since they met in , Angela and Martin have both had a passion for animals and have their own ways of supporting those in need. Martin is currently the chairman of a charity called Greyhounds In Need, and as a couple they rehome dogs. ‘We’ve always had dogs since our wedding  years ago,’ Angela says with a smile. ‘Our last dog died in July aged  and a half and she was a rescued greyhound from Spain that we rehomed through Martin’s charity. aposThe movement basically rescues these particular dogs from Spain, where they’re used for hunting,’ she explains. ‘They have beautul long faces, necks and tails, but when they retire from hunting they’re abandoned and treated terribly by the Spanish public. aposThey really dislike these types of dogs for some reason. They’re kicked, beaten, spat on, and have cigarettes stubbed into them after they’re released on the streets,’ she tells us solemnly. ‘Luckily though,’ she adds, ‘in Italy they adore them. A lot get rehomed there. They refer to them as “Bella Figura” and they’re well loved. The dference between countries is immense. But we’ve always taken them in too and we think they’re the most wonderful dogs in the world.’ And le has been purely animals with Angela and Martin choosing to not have children. ‘I never wanted to spend my le bringing up kids,’ she tells us.

Now politicians from ious parties have suggested the gatherings could cause Britain to go back into a full lockdown, and the death toll to rise rapidly. Brighton Pavilion MP Caroline Lucas, who represents the Green Party, said: To visitors who love coming to Brighton, we love having you, but I’m asking you now – please, stay away until the city is ready to welcome you. It would be a disaster for themstrict lockdown measures had to be re-imposed locally because of a rising infection rate partly brought about by thousands of visitors.The Sun Online reports the recent warm weather has seen people travel large distances to coastal towns, including those in Cornwall and Devon.We see waves at the beach but the wave I do not want to see is a second virus wave caused by too many people coming to our fabulous coastline, Sheryll Murray, the Conservative MP for South East Cornwall, told the publication.The daily number of coronavirus deaths in UK hospitals in the last two weeks: May  -  May  -  May  -  May  -  May  -  May  -  May  -  May  -  May  -  May  -  May  -  June  -  June  -  June  -  June  -  People should also make themselves aware of tides. When the tide comes in the beach can shrink substantially and this should be taken account of. And Steve Double, the MP for nearby St Austell and Newquay, said: Whilst people have the freedom to travel to visit beaches, we would ask people to continue to be responsible. If you arrive and a beach looks full then please don’t go onto the beach, it’s very important thatpeople do visit they maintain social distancing.

With hundreds still dying every week we are now moving slowly towards lting the lockdown that was imposed on the country back in March. But as Britain gets moving again it seem one area of the country almost entirely escaped the disease. With just  confirmed cases to date, and seven deaths, it seems that in the coastal council area of Ceredigion in Wales, the virus never really took hold.The initial flurry of cases in this rural part of Wales was comparable at the start of the outbreak to the local authorities of Wales that ended up being worst hit by the virus. Yet here it just sort of petered out, reports Wales Online. On the face of it, the geography of the largely rural county could explain the relatively low spread of cases, as across the world, big cities were the first and hardest hit by Covid-. Yet this alone does not explain why Ceredigion was spared. Neighbouring rural areas of Wales were far worse affected. The latest data from Public Health Wales show Powys has had  cases for every , people in the area. Pembrokeshire . Gwynedd a painful . In comparison Ceredigion has had just . Nor can this be accounted for by a lack of testing. The pitiless eye of the ONS shows that Ceredigion has had the fewest deaths where Covid- is mentioned on the death certicate: . for every , people compared to  in Pembrokeshire,  in Gwynedd and  in Powys.Neither can it be that the deaths simply werenapost attributed to Covid-. Data from the ONS shows that there have been hardly any excess deaths in the Hywel Dda health board area. The spike in the south and south-east of Wales simply doesnapost show up here. And Ceredigion has been the area of Hywel Dda with the least Covid-. And it is not that the virus never reached the area, with data showing it tracked identically to that of neighbouring Pembrokeshireaposs for the first two weeks until it, somehow, just subsided. In the mainland, no local authority has had fewer cases. Even the Highland council of Scotland has has had more . So what happened  One big dference that sets Ceredigion apart was that even before it had recorded its first case of Covid-, it had set up a homemade in-house test track and trace system.  The man behind it, Barry Rees, the corporate director for Ceredigion Council, is a scientist by training. He believes contact tracing is the only way of pursuing the disease then rather than following it. Is this the reason for why the county has emerged unscathed  Has a simple contact tracing system saved hundreds of lives, and what does it mean for the population in le after lockdown who havenapost yet built up immunity In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, before the first death had been recorded in Wales, Ceredigion Council convened their first Gold Command meeting.Bringing together the key people in the council, including leader Ellen ap Gwynn and Mr Rees, they needed to decide what to do. Just weeks before Easter, the Ceredigion population would have been twice its normal size due to the thousands of students at Aberystwyth University and the early-season holidaymakers flocking to resorts like Llangrannog and New Quay along the Cardigan Bay coastline.  They had already worked closely with the university, which was one of the first universities to close in Wales. And, long before the national lockdown was announced, the council had instructed all holiday and caravan parks to close too. Thanks to the councilaposs proactive action, by mid-March, they were down to their core population, said Mr Rees. But even so, Eion Evans, the chief executive at CCC, challenged the group in Gold Command: Are we missing a trick  Is there anything we havenapost done  Sat around that table, Mr Rees, who was a biology teacher for  years, cast his mind to what happens with other notiable diseases like legionella and food poisoning. In those cases, it was up to the councilaposs public protection team to set up a contact tracing system and carry out investigative work, so why not do the same for Covid-, he thought. So I piped up about having read about contact tracing in south east Asia where they had trialled it and were able to put the manpower in to do it, said Mr Rees, who has been in his current post for two years.  I knew we had the skillset and so I got a couple of colleagues together who created something, based on research which was happening internationally. At first, it was nothing complex - just a simple questionnaire which could be filled in manually, as a way of contact tracing. Thataposs the way it has developed really, probably helped by our lower numbers. Mr Rees says that simple system has enabled them to carry out contact tracing on every confirmed case in the county. He said: Weaposve done so for the past seven to eight weeks now. Weaposve picked up all positive cases and been contact tracing on them all. A couple of environmental health officers were assigned to pick up on positive tests. Precautions were even extended to their own staff. Weaposve got a HR system where people will put down a reason for their absence on a daily basis, explained Mr Rees. So we check to seeanybody has put down their absence for coronavirus symptoms. We picked those up and were able to contact them as well.  Before they could begin, the team, led by Mr Rees, had to set out the moral imperative. He added: We also had a colleague from data protection,cecause for the first time really we were using peoplesapos data to contact potentially a secondary contact who was or wasnapost a member of their close family. So we were using their data in a new way, so we checked that out with our data protection officer and he liaised with the information commissioner office. We set up our own very simple data management system. It was a manual effort with one of the environmental health officers picking up the phone, explaining what we were trying to do. In the beginning, people werenapost aware of a test, track and trace system so we had to explain all of that to them. The data we collected was input to our data management system, which was very much homemade, so no one was scribbling down responses on a piece of paper. Then we used our in-house environmental health expertise to help decide how and when to contact people. Mr Rees, , is keen to stress he is just the ideas person who facilitates the work. He adds: The doing has been done by other people. He believes effective contact tracing is a race against time which is why his system took a conservative approach and assumed every symptomatic person was assumed to be a positive case. Numbers started off pretty low and there was one busy weekend where we had a couple of positive tests we needed to follow up, explained Mr Rees. We also had some symptomatic members of staff and we really needed to snuff that out and pursue that. Theyaposve subsequently been tested and that test was negative but we did some preventative stuff, prior to the test. One of the worries is that,the starting point for the contact tracing is a positive test, youaposre already some way down the line. If people arenapost following the advice being given, then youaposre missing a few days for people to go through the further process of being tested. You might be losing  hours where these people may not be following the guidance and potentially spreading the virus.  We short circuited that loop and didnapost wait for their test results to come back before taking action. We were able to send a note down to our contact tracing team to gather more information. If theyaposre showing symptoms then thereaposs almost the presumption of a positive test and that guides the advice we give to them. As the rest of the UK starts to catch up with Ceredigion, with a national test, track and trace system being rolled out right across the country, Mr Rees says we have to be careful what we wish for. A decision needs to be made, he says, between either speeding up the turnaround time for getting test results - thataposs got to be really really quick, or instigating contact tracing with a starting point of when people exhibit symptoms. Youaposve got to be careful what you wish for because suddenly we could swamp the whole system and the system could fail because of the numbers involved, he warned. In an ideal world weaposd have the capacity to catch people when theyaposre symptomatic, do some contact tracing and advise them on their behaviours and that would be able to really get hold of it. Weaposd be really pursuing the disease then rather than following it then. Mr Rees is wary about putting Ceredigion on a pedestal for doing anything better than anybody .

Video footage of the event has been posted on social media that shows a large numbers of young people dancing to house music and drinking beer while failing to practice social distancing until the early hours of Saturday morning. Partygoers were also assaulted with a male sustaining a broken leg, a female suffering a broken ankle and another female being treated for burns to her legs. The rave was unlicensed with no visible security and is thought to have taken place on land off New Cut Lane on the border of Kirkby and Rainford in Merseyside.Police were alerted about the event so they blocked routes to the site and turned away around  people who were on foot and in cars, Liverpool Echo reports.Officers also said they dealt with  people for drugs offences and a further  were given fines for breaching the lockdown. Four men were spotted by officers packing up DJ equipment at around .am when most of the revellers had left. All were arrested on suspicion of Section  public order offences, causing a public nuisance and were slapped with dispersal order notices. Police said they have seized the DJ equipment, lighting and lasers used at the rave.  The rave appears to have taken place on land belonging to Paintball Airsoft Lasertag in deep countryside. When contacted by the Echo the owners said they would not like to issue a comment just yet. Local residents expressed their anger on a Facebook group, and many raised concerns about how the event breached social distancing rules. One said: Something wrong with them. Numbers are going up people are still catching this virus but its ok letaposs have a rave. Another said: Knowsley has one of the highest rates of the virus in the country and I canapost believe people in this country are so selfish the sun comes out the idiot brigade hit beaches and parks but to see so many selfish idiots from the area where we live is disgusting. Another commented: What the hell. Is going on. Do they not under stand whataposs going on. It is so selfish. It will end up that Kirkby will be in a lock down. And can not go any were. Do what they say you can have  people in your garden.  metres apart. I hope all there parents are proud of them. You need to think about what you doing.  One said: It’s utterly selfish and disgusting that they only care about themselves, an what it might implicate.. guaranteed at least  of them will be a carrier. Some raised other concerns. One person said: No words apart from where did the parents think they where. Everyone thinking about just corona what about the kids there that are underage that shouldn’t even be there, what happenssomeone gets killed in there or a big fight with no security, who’s going to be responsible for something happening in there., another resident posted. There have been a number of illegal raves on Merseyside in recent weeks.An event dubbed Huytonbury is thought to have taken place in woodland near Huyton on June . According to reports, the illegal gathering, , saw lockdown flouters fighting and taking drugs while leaving mountains of vile rubbish for families to find.  And police prevented an illegal rave on the Sefton coast on May . A police spokesman said: We arrested four men and seized DJ equipment after attending a wooded area in Rainford overnight following reports of an illegal rave. Police identied the site of the gathering which occurred in private land near New Cut Lane Coach Road, close to Rainford, the M and Kirkby. Officers were deployed to key routes into the woodland, including roads and rural land, as a large number of young people were seen on the site and attempting to gain entrance from around pm. Police turned away around  people in vehicles and on foot. The East Lancs Road was closed at its junctions with Catchdale Moss Lane and Coopers Lane to deter further attendees from gaining access in vehicles, and a dispersal order was introduced covering the area of woodland. At around .am, when the majority of people had dispersed, four males were seen by officers packing up DJ equipment.  They were arrested on suspicion of Section  public order offences, causing a public nuisance and were provided with dispersal order notices. They have been taken into custody and DJ equipment, lighting and lasers seized. A further  dispersal notices were provided,  people dealt with for drugs offences,  dispersal zone notices issued, and  Covid- tickets issued. A signicant amount of rubbish, alcohol containers and evidence of drug misuse was located and the site is now being cleaned up by the local authority. Chief Superintendent Ngaire Waine added: “All those attending have put themselves and others in the community at signicant risk. Not only have they risked catching and spreading the coronavirus, but due to the numbers of people consuming of drugs and alcohol in dark woods, somebody could have quite easily got seriously hurt or worse. Indeed it was reported one male sustained a broken leg, one female a broken ankle and another female suffered burns to her legs.  “Government guidance still states that we must continue social distancing, that we must only meet in groups of six at most, and act sensibly. Clearly, those attending this rave took no heed whatsoever of that. “They also left behind a huge amount of rubbish which will now have to be removed. It is clear that the organisers and those attending care very little for public health, the community surrounding them or indeed their own safety. “It is particularly disappointing that some of those attending purported to be protesting against the lockdown in order to make a vain attempt to legitimise their attendance at the rave. “Having to deal with these sorts of unnecessary incidents puts an extra strain on both police and our partners, at a time when all key workers face a huge challenge to join the national effort to beat this pandemic while continuing to protect the public.

The reproduction rate of the virus - known as the aposRapos - is higher in some parts of the UK than others. The emerging challenge has led Health Secretary Matt Hancock to caution yesterday that parts of England could face stricter lockdowns than others when outbreaks are spotted. But the government has faced criticism this week as some suggest it is easing the lockdown too quickly, with the UK death toll passing , yesterday. The new estimates suggest the R is between . and . in England,  in the South West and . in the North West. The R rate measures how many people with the  coronavirus on average go on to be infected from a single case of Covid-. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here It is being used by the governmentaposs science advisory group, SAGE, to monitor the efficacy of Britainaposs lockdown restrictions as officials strive to keep the R below . If it is  or higher, the virus will spread exponentially through the population, while a value less than  indicates the virus is in decline. Concerns over outbreak hotspots came as scientists and doctors pleaded with the government to hold an inquiry ahead of a potential second wave this winter. And schools in the regions emerging as suffering higher transmission rates are warning they should be able to keep their gates closed in local outbreaks. Schools are being strongly advised not to admit more pupils after new data suggested coronavirus could still be spreading in the North West of England.  Headteachers in Tameside, east of Manchester, have been told to delay the wider reopening of schools beyond key workersapos and vulnerable children, planned for Monday, until there is further assurance, the councilaposs director of public health, Dr Jeanelle de Gruchy said in a letter to schools. The North West has the highest rate of Covid- infections in England according to Public Health England . Data has suggested the reproductive rate, known as the R value, is higher than  in the region. Other local councils in the region are understood to be monitoring the situation with Tameside postponing the reopening of schools until June .  But Andy Burnham, Mayor of Greater Manchester, has questioned whether such measures are workable, calling them a recipe for chaos. Both he and Liverpool City RegionMayor Steve Rotheram have questioned whether lockdown relaxation was being lted too soon, driven from London, with the regions and the North not being listened to. Council bosses in Liverpool and Gateshead led a northern backlash against the Government announcement last month advising schools to reopen for Years  and  from June .  Many councils in the areas have only partially reopened to pupils other than vulnerable children or those of key workers. In a warning that could deal another blow to schools and other essential services fully reopening, experts are saying fear a bigger threat could be yet to come. Scientists are still racing to determine whether deadly Covid- will flourish in winter, like seasonal bugs including influenza, as the world continues the search for a vaccine. In a letter totoday those fears were outlined starkly in a direct public appeal to Boris Johnsonaposs government. Twenty-seven experts say the Government is without “quick, practical solutions to some of the structural problems that have made implementing an effective coronavirusresponse so dficult”. They write: “If, as seems probable, there is a second wave this winter, many more will die unless we find quick, practical solutions to some ofstructural problems,” adds the letter.  It was signed by top experts including former World Health Organisation director Professor Anthony Costello and former Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesmember Professor Deenan Pillay. The letter warned policy-makers and healthcare systems were poorly prepared for another onslaught of Covid-. It continued: “We call on all political parties to commit to a rapid, transparent, expert inquiry to address these issues. This must avoid erting the efforts of those responding to the crisis or apportioning blame, but should propose feasible ways to overcome the obstacles faced by those on the frontline of the response and help them to save lives.” Deaths in UK hospitals so far: , Deaths across all settings: ,Total deaths registered so far: ,Excess deaths so far in : ,Sources: coronavirus.data.gov.uk and ONS It was also revealed yesterday that the number of people with Covid- in England fell during the second half of May to , new infections daily, down from around ,. A more recent R infection update showed in the last week that new infections are flatlining, but outbreaks in hospitals and care homes are still sending fresh cases back out in to the community.  R rate in Englandaposs regions These are the estimated figures as a median average, according to research by Public Health England and Cambridge University. Research by Public Health England and Cambridge University’s MRC Biostatistics Unit - which estimates the R number in dferent regions - suggested it could be above  in the North West.

Stick to a routine We are creatures of habit, so work out exactly when you’ll be eating and snacking, and your body will begin to get hungry when it knows it’s time to have food. Try sticking to eating three square meals a day with perhaps one or two healthy snacks a day. . Think first If you are going to be eating between meals, choose healthier snacks. Although unhealthier options like chocolate will make you feel good straight away, when you eventually crash, you’ll be regretting your choice. Also think about how much you’re eating. If you’re opening a large family pack of crisps, try and eat it throughout the week instead of in one day.  . Don’t have food close at hand If you are working from home, keep your work space separate to your eating space. If you are eating and working in the same room, your brain doesn’t know when it’s time to work or time to eat. If you want to be really strict, don’t buy any unhealthy snacks – you can’t eat what you don’t have.  . Manage stress Excess snacking tends to come as a result of stress or boredom. Take time out to go for a walk in nature, or try a few minutes of meditation every day to ease anxiety. If you snack because you are bored, plan tasks for throughout the day, or find a hobby to keep you entertained and stop your brain from wandering to food.  . Speak to friends If you’re struggling and feel the urge to raid the cupboard even though you’re not really hungry, pick up the phone. Keeping in touch with friends and family helps you stay connected, and by the time you get off the phone you may have forgotten about the snack! . Curb your cravings  - Eat a little dark chocolate …at least % cocoa. The bitter flavour of dark chocolate is supposed to leave you feeling fuller, as it can slow the rate your stomach empties itself after a meal. Some studies prove even smelling dark chocolate can help with appetite suppression.  - Drink green tea For centuries, people have used green tea to suppress their cravings and appetite. This is because it contains EGCG , which makes you feel satisfied rather than hungry. Green tea can also help boost metabolism.  - Spice up dinnertime Capsaicinand capsiatecan help boost your metabolism and the feeling of fullness. Some evidence suggests that eating spicy food canboost your body temperature to burn more calories, so don’t be afraid to add some spices to your meals.  - Incorporate ginger into your diet Ginger has a wealth of benefits, but it is also believed to be a natural appetite suppressor. Ginger has been used for centuries for its stimulating effect on the digestive system, which can help you feel fuller for longer.

The person - whose identity, gender and age remains unknown - claimed they had gone to extreme s to maintain the lie, including moving into accommodation, attending lectures and befriending students, reports BirminghamLive. As well as fooling their parents with the lie, students attending the uni had also fallen for it, so they had to pretend they were sitting exams in dferent rooms. According to the Facebook post, the alleged student explained they had very strict parents and had been afraid to tell them they had spectacularly failed their A-Levels. So instead, they decided to create a fake results letter and pretend they had been accepted to their first choice uni to avoid being disowned. They wrote: My parents are very strict and wouldnapost accept me not going to university. I had UoB as my firm choice university but failed spectacularly in my A-levels and couldnapost even get into my insurance choice. What I regret doing was telling the other students I lived with the lie as well, I just wanted to fit in but they all believed it.  They continued: I ended up going to Freshersapos week and managing to go along to societies as a non member. What made things worse was I had a friend from home who also was doing my course and I took things too far and told her I couldnapost get into my timetable could she send me a copy of hers. I was shocked how easy it was to get into the lectures rooms and the first two weeks I went to lectures and made many friends who all believed me. I stopped after a few weeks but the people I met were great and I didnapost want to admit I had lied. I would just join in on the complaining about deadlines, I got around not being in their exam rooms by saying I had anxiety and had to be in a separate room.  The person went on to say that their parents were financially supporting them the entire time but they also worked in a restaurant to save money. In second year the lie got even deeper when they agreed to move into a shared student house with people studying the course they were pretending to be on. Their biggest worry wasnapost their pals finding out the truth though, it was all about the parents. My biggest concern was going to be my parents wanting to go to graduation but now its cancelled it couldnapost be more perfect for me, they wrote.  While that particular issue may have been resolved, the person is now unsure what le after fake uni will be like for them - and theyaposre even considering moving countries to escape the lie. None of my friends from home or anyone knows that I have faked everything and I am so deep into the lie Iaposve considered moving countries to escape. My parents arenapost going to be happy with me not having a grad job but Iaposve blamed it on corona. They added that they were unsure whether to add their pretend degree to their CV and asked the people of Facebook for some advice. Do I just put my fake degree on my CV and go with it, I know my subject very well from reading the textbooks and having to maintain conversation with my course mates.  Surely no company is going to check my degree so throughly they find me out as a fake  It feels good to admit this finally but I am seriousanyone knows what sort of checks a company can do please help.More than , people have liked the post with hundreds sharing and commenting.One person replied: This would be such a good TV show.

Peter Erdmann, , told the Sunday Mirror that Christian Brueckner gave sweets and cuddly toys to children aged seven to  for TWO YEARS. He said kids turned up at school with gts they said Brueckner gave them – and another local claimed children went behind the counter and into the storeroom of his shop.Peter now says police should investigate whether Brueckner, , was grooming kids at the kiosk just  yards from a school in Braunschweig, north Germany. The caretaker said today: “The police should definitely investigate whether Christian abused them. “He was mainly giving the presents to boys, but also some girls. He was giving them presents nearly every day and it went on for a couple of years. “I thought nothing of it and just thought he was a friendly man. I used to go into the kiosk and he would give me free shots of Jagermeister. He knew I was the school caretaker. It turns my stomach now.” Peter spoke as police in Germany revealed they are probing possible links connecting Brueckner to the disappearance of Maddie and three German children. Three-year-old Maddie, from Rothley, Leics, vanished while on holiday in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in May .Police are now looking at the cases of Inga Gehricke, five, and René Hasee, six, in Germany – and the murder of German girl Carola Titze, , in Belgium.Brueckner is in jail on drugs offences but can technically apply for parole. He was also jailed for seven years last December for raping a -year-old woman at her villa in Praia da Luz in . But a legal challenge over that conviction is reported to be under way over extradition issues.  Brueckner took a phone call in Praia da Luz on the night Maddie vanished. He lived locally, on and off, and had a grey Jaguar and a Westfalia campervan which were seen in the area. Caretaker Peter told the Sunday Mirror he regrets not speaking to police earlier. He worked at Grundschule Hohestieg School in Braunschweig from  until  and says Brueckner lived locally from -.Peter said: “The kids would come to school holding ponies and teddy bears. They said Christian gave them to them and he always had a big bag of them in the storeroom. “I asked himhe gave gts to the kids and he told me he had a box full of such gts in the kiosk.  “He would walk past the school at least once a day while walking his two dogs. I wish I had raised what was going on with my bosses at the time. “I regret it and not being more suspicious. It is gut-wrenching and I am disgusted by what I read about him.” There is no suggestion Brueckner abused any of the school’s pupils or the kids in the kiosk.  Another local named Norbert said he spotted kids as young as nine behind the counter. Norbert grew up in the area and later moved into Brueckner’s old flat nearby. He said: “He sometimes let children work behind the cashier. Children were also seen in the storeroom, but no one knew about his convictions then. He disgusts me.” Norbert allowed the Sunday Mirror inside the flat, which he says Brueckner left in a disgusting condition. He said: “There was rubbish everywhere. The floors and bottom of the walls were black and there was vomit and insects everywhere. Pest control had to disinfect everything. There were broken windows. The bedroom was wrecked. Everything was damaged. He was an animal. He held parties all night and neighbours complained to police.  “Who knowsthe children got involved  It wouldn’t surprise me.” Norbert also claimed Brueckner, who lived in the flat with a -year-old girlfriend, left two dogs to die of thirst during onevisit to the Algarve. And he alleged Brueckner ed and threatened him with a kne while demanding to take a freezer and air- conditioning unit he had left behind.

Most fans would think an owner would buy a club and then buy other clubs in other countries.“How I would see it personally is that you create really good partnerships, like Aberdeen have with Atlanta. That’s a fantastic partnership.“I’ve been out there. The owner has more zeros than you can write down. They’ve got a great structure. There are amazing ways of working.”Asghar, who is currently working with United boss Robbie Neilson on recruitment for next season, feels the club – and Scottish football as a whole – has lots to learn from other nations’ approach to marketing the game and driving revenue.That’s a task he is passionate about accomplishing at Tannadice.“I understand that Scottish fans traditionally come to the game at  o’clock on a Saturday after a few pints with their pals,” he said.“[They] have a pie at half-time and after a game they’re moaning about the team or talking about how well it’s done. A brilliant weekend, back in work on Monday.“Now football is much more than that.“We’ve got the opportunity to get Dundee United out to places like India, the Middle East, South America and the US because technology makes it a lot easier.“We’ve got a product we can definitely market better across the world.“It’s challenging. American clubs speak to us about how we get such passion and support. Dundee United fans have fathers and grandfathers who supported the club. That’s always going to be our core.“Now we need to encourage that fanbase to be bigger.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip.

The firrst houses are due to be built later this year.He said: ldquoWe have a unique opportunity here with a blank canvas for a new town at a time when climate change is central to policies.ldquoI also think the Covid- pandemic has driven forward the idea that people can work from home and find alternative ways to work with the support of digital technology.Central to the vision is alternative ways to travel with an emphasis on walkways and cycle routes.A new train station at a central hub within an area the council has dubbed Greater Blindwells will provide additional access to public transport.To the north of the central hub between Cockenzie and Port Seton and Longniddry there are proposals for a water park or outdoor leisure area with the potential to create a lido, space for kayaking and other water sports.At the former Cockenzie Power Station site, less than half-a-mile away, a new centre of excellence is proposed described as a training school and ldquoexemplar development in modular manufacture and construction.The council is launching an eight-week consultation on their vision for the area from tomorrow and people will be able to go in and give their views.They are also hoping that as lockdown restrictions ease they may be able to have outdoor exhibitions for people who cannot access the proposals online and will be advertising the consultation locally so people can get in touch through the post.The Scottish Government is currently looking at revising its framework and the council has made its case for the wider area to be classed as a National Development, which will give their proposals support at a national level.The consultation will open at https:eastlothianconsultations  from Monday, June ."},{"url":null,"title":"ball-outdoor-sports-return-garden-centres-re-open","story":"It was paradise for county golfers as they were able toto the greens after two months of inactivity.Some county bowling clubs also reopened, while beaches were busy during one of the hottest days of the year, despite East Lothian Council keeping coastal car parks closed.The majority of East Lothianrsquos -plus bowls clubs have reopened.The clubs still closed ndash including East Linton, Tranent, Elphinstone, North Berwick and Prestongrange ndash have indicated they are looking to open when the Scottish Government moves into phase two of its plan.

drew  responses.She said nearly half of parents who responded and had children who turn three in August were in favour of the change.However she added: ldquoMost parents carers of children who will be three years of age between September   and October ,  were not in favour of this change.Despite this she said the change would bring East Lothian into line with Scottish Government guidance and the practices across Scotland.She said: ldquoIn moving from a four-term to a three-term entry we will continue to support early entry for children with particular needs or those considered as vulnerable,

local authority with a series of images also unveiled.The proposed ClimatEvolution Zone would cover the under-construction town of Blindwells and surroundingcommunities stretching from Prestonpans to Longniddry and inland to Tranent and Macmerry.East Lothian Council is petitioning the Scottish Government to extend the National Development status given to the former Cockenzie Power Station site in its National Planning Frameworkdocument to a wider area in its planned revised framework which is under review.This could pave the way for the creation of the ClimatEvolution Zone which could transform the area over the next  years through innovative approaches to development.A public consultation on the vision has been launched by the council and breaks the plans down into dferent themes from environment to travel.It asks people to give their views on its approach to a wide range of issues including access and movement the water environment culture, heritage and leisure greenspace and bioersity strong communities and regeneration and enterprise.However, the vision has already come under fire from Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council which branded it ldquocomplex and unclear.The community council warned that the launch of a new vision for the area three years after the local authority produced its Cockenzie Masterplan document ndash which it has never adopted ndash would leave the public with no confidence in the planning system.East Lothian Council paid consultants to produce the Cockenzie Masterplan for the former Cockenzie Power Station site, which it owns, after a series of public consultations in  but the report remains an informal ldquovisionary document.Now the former power station site could be merged into the new ClimatEvolution Zone with no reference to the original masterplan.Bryan Hickman, community council chairman, said: ldquoThe community council are very concerned by the documents recently published by the council.\"We understood that the changes required for NPF related to the former power station site.\"The y report now extends to Tranent, Prestonpans, Cockenzie and Port Seton, Longniddry and Blindwells as well as the power station site.\"Whilst some of the objectives are to be welcomed, the overall content is complex and unclear and includes such a large area as to be unmanageable in its detail.ldquoThe existing communities have been consulted on the power station site and the result was a masterplan commissioned by the council but not adopted by them.\"We have submitted this masterplan to be included in NPF.\"A number of consultations have taken place in our area and they have come to nothing.\"The feeling is the residents have lost confidence in the system.Neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council also raised concerns about the consultation.Brian Weddell, chairman, questioned whether the proposed train station in the new plan would ever happen, saying: ldquoThere has been no meaningful consultation with local communities who all have concerns about the impact of this development on their communities.The new consultation is based around a study, drawn up in partnership with East Lothian Council, the Scottish Government, The Lothian Drainage Partnership, SEPA, Scottish Water and Scottish Natural Heritage.It considers how the council can take the opportunity of creating a new town at Blindwells and harness the latest technologies to reduce the arearsquos carbon footprint.Among the ideas up for discussion is using groundwater at Blindwells to create waterways and using natural geothermic energy to heat the outdoor water features.Douglas Proudfoot, project leader, said the idea behind the new water features was to avoid putting pipes underground to remove groundwater and utilise it instead as the new town of Blindwells develops on the former opencast coal site of the same name between Longniddry and Tranent.The first houses are due to be built later this year.He said: ldquoWe have a unique opportunity here with a blank canvas for a new town at a time when climate change is central to policies.\"I also think the Covid- pandemic has driven forward the idea that people can work from home and find alternative ways to work with the support of digital technology.Central to the vision is alternative ways to travel with an emphasis on walkways and cycle routes.A new train station at a central hub within an area the council has dubbed Greater Blindwells will provide additional access to public transport.To the north of the central hub between Cockenzie and Port Seton and Longniddry there are proposals for a water park or outdoor leisure area with the potential to create a lido with space for kayaking and other water sports.At the former Cockenzie Power Station site, less than half-a-mile away, a new centre of excellence is proposed described as a training school and ldquoexemplar developmentin modular manufacture and construction.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray welcomed the ambitious strategy.He said: ldquoThe Cockenzie and Blindwells sites are adjacent to one another and it has always been inevitable that their development will be closely linked, so it makes sense to seek to extend National Development status to Blindwells.ldquoThe whole area offers unique potential to transform these former industrial sites into places where people can live and work in a sustainable way.Kenny MacAskill, East Lothian MP, also welcomed the project which will lsquointeractrsquo with neighbouring communities.He said: ldquoThe area is a far wider community and cannot be seen in isolation.The inclusion of adjacent communities is therefore essential.Councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the proposals are not a lsquofinalised masterplanrsquo but rather a ldquohigh level document which sets out an ambitious vision for the area over the coming  years.He said: ldquoItrsquos an exciting opportunity to ensure that one of the key areas of East Lothian, is developed in an innovative way.\"Itrsquos not all about whatrsquos new, though.\"We are looking at enhancing the existing local environment and making the most of the arearsquos unique history as well as its mining and agricultural heritage and the site of the Battle of Prestonpans.The council launched its eightweek consultation on its online hub on Monday.The Scottish Government is revising its National Development Planning Framework which gives an overview of what it wants to see develop on key sites across Scotland.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoWe are grateful for the many views and ideas received in response to early engagement on National Planning Framework  .Our analysis of the responses is underway and will continue over the summer, and we expect to publish an

Tables will be spaced out in bars to keep people apart.Freshers fairs, in which university societies vie to attract new members, could be massively scaled back or moved online.Meanwhile, quirky ways to encourage social distancing ndash such as large comedy hats or wearable tables ndash may become a feature of student union events.A Universities UK briefing previously suggested students could be kept in small groups under a \"protective bubble\" approach.It comes amid fears universitiesface operating deficits of between pound million and pound million in the next academic year alone.Blake Gray, honorary secretary of theGlasgow University Union , said it is working on three dferent plans.The first is based around a normal freshers week, while the second is an \"off-the-shelf\" plan that would allow much of the traditional festivities to be delayed until it is safe to push ahead.The third looks at how freshers week could take place with restrictions and social distancing.This could involve greater use of online technology, while events usually held in smaller spaces ndash such as pub quizzes ndash could move to larger halls and debatingchambers.\"I wouldnt underestimate the creativity and the ingenuity of students in coming up with things that well be able to do,\" Gray said.He said the union is \"cautiously optimistic\" that bars will be open by September.Meanwhile, student officials have been attending online training sessions run by a security and stewardingcompany, focusing on ways the venue can operate safely.\"Were having risk assessments and things carried out,\" Gray said. \"Were very keen that once we open again it will be safe and it will be secure.\"He said the union \"of course\" feels sympathy for incoming students keen for a traditional freshers week.\"We all had that experience, and we really loved it,\" he said. \"We want to make sure we can give them as much of it as we can.\"He added:\"Were really focused on the idea thatwe cant provide that type of experience in September, we really want to provide that at some point in the year and still have a freshers week at some point.\"Nam Ranpuria, president of the GUU, said it all depends on what guidance is in place at the time.Kayla-Megan Burns, vice president of community atStrathclyde Studentsrsquo Union, also pointed to a greater use of online technology.\"I think were definitely trying to get bars open because that is just one of the key places for students to socialise,\" she said.\"Its one of the freedoms that you get whenever you come to uni.\"People turn  and they can go out and socialise and have a drink with all of their new mates.\"So I think were definitely going to try and keep them open, but at the same time, itll be quite dferent.\"Tables will need to be more spaced out.\"Were currently looking at more quirky ways to try and socially distance students.\"Youve seen across the globe clever and funny ways to keep people socially distanced, like wearing the funny hats with the big arms on them to keep people two metres apart, or the floating tables to give people a two metre radius.\"She said such unusual measures might not look all that out of place in a student union, adding: \"I think wed be able to take it in our stride, hopefully.\"Club nights present one of the biggest issues.\"At those kind of events students do tend to take a drink and that, and it becomes really, really dficult to ensure that people are socially distanced in that kind of crowd,\" Burns said.\"I dont knowthats going to be something were going to be able to do straight away, because as much as we do want students to get those really crucial experiences where they get to go out and have a bit of fun, at the same time its much betterwe leave those kind of mad events until we know its definitely safe.\"The fun isnt worth itstudents come out ill at the end of it.\"Burns said forging a sense of community is \"extremely beneficial for peoples sense of wellbeing, and can be really beneficial for retention in university courses\".International students could find it particularly tough.She said the union is hoping to hold events in person, but it \"wont be the same sort of thing\".Burns said: \"Previously, our freshers fairs would take place across two days and our entire ten-storey building nearly every nook and cranny would be filled with student societies, sports clubs, other student-related groups.\"Our whole building would just be packed with that for two days straight.\"Obviously social distancing just wont allow things like that to happen.\"She said the fair could instead happen over a \"much longer time period, so we dont need to worry about capacity as much\".\"Rather than everyone trying to jam in to see everything within two days, its more likely that we would have a much smaller scale fair over the course of potentially a few weeks, so that students still get that experience but they arent as at risk of being in a crowded space and social distancing measures are still able to be there and theyre still able to be safe,\" she said.Kellie Ioannou, vice president of student activities atDundee University Students Association , said it is not expecting its nightclubs to have reopened byfreshers week.She said: \"In the absence of our club nights, we are exploring creative alternative events that comply with social distancing requirements but also ensure that students can connect with each other and with DUSA.\"When we do reopen our nightclubs, we plan to have a full freshers week event programme, however, we understand this may not coincide with the start of the new academic year.\"We will continue with our online DJ sets that we currently run over the weekends and we are still actively encouraging our fantastic student societies to host inventive online events.\"She said the union is \"in the process of investigating how our freshers fair, which usually attracts over , people, can be facilitated online to ensure that students donrsquot miss out on signing up to over  student-led societies\".It is a similar picture where.Jamie Rodney, president of the University of St Andrews Students Association, said freshersrsquo week \"will look very dferent this year, but were working hard behind the scenes to bring students some unique and creative events that can be enjoyed both from home and in St Andrews

Working in the summer house at the top of the garden makes sense: with doors and windows wide open, a breeze keeps it cool enough to concentrate until mid afternoon, by which time it is like a sauna, except with a better view.On the hottest day of the year so far, ewes and their sturdy lambs stared at me while I read, on their way for a deeper patch of shade. On wires overhead, a brood of young starlings was learning to fly.The parents gathered them, and appeared to offer instructions on take-off and landing before soaring away, chicks in tow. One with ruffled feathers seemed unable to summon the courage.While its siblings filled the skies, it hopped left and right, one wing extended as it kept its balance, like a tightrope walker having a wobbleEventually it swooped down, into the next garden, rather than joining the others which by now were flying in formation.It is hard to concentrate on work when therersquos a baby coal-tit dangling upside down in the crab apple tree, unconcerned at being watched. This old and gnarled tree has become the woodpeckersrsquo Pret A Manger. One of them ndash a greater spotted that arrives in a flash of scarlet and black ndash is easily spooked, darting off the second I look up. But there is an older, bigger bird that drives off the others, and seems fearless. It pecked at the peanuts ashammering a nail. Like the bleating of sheep, it is a most peaceful soundtrack.Sparrow fledglings have made the garden their own, turning it into a creche. Round and fluffy as dandelion clocks they bounce on the birch tree, learning to hold their grip, before ing back into the hedge for a breather. There are so many nests in there, itrsquos like a tenement. At moments of peak activity, it quivers and shakes asit is about to erupt.With days so warm, everyone has been living outdoors. You can smell barbecue coals, and hear the laughter of cautious reunions. The other afternoon, I answered the door to find a woman clutching three tubs of ice-cream. It was a delivery from a local farm for neighbours who werenrsquot answering the door. When I managed to locate them, she handed me a tub of vanilla as a thank you. Summer just got sweeter."},{"url":null,"title":"pete-wishart-coronavirus-may-helped-devolution-come-age","story":"Assumptions that guided devolution have been tested and the mechanics underpinning the relationship between the four Governments reassessed. New language has emerged and new working arrangements invented on the hoof. There has also been unprecedented co-operation between the four administrations with territorial claims sacriced in order to work together. Political dferences have even been put on hold to ensure maximum co-operation.When the COVID pandemic is over the whole episode will emerge as a pivotal moment in the history of devolution.# This is why the Scottish Affairs Committee has undertaken an inquiry into Coronavirus in Scotland with an emphasis on the working arrangements of the lsquofour-nation approachrsquo. We want to better understand its meaning and how it has worked as a collective strategy.Has operational independence been suspended  What has informed its assumptions and who is actually responsible for the ious interventions that have been put in place for the entire UK to follow  Wersquoll also inevitably stray into what this episode means for devolution across the UK and how effective and resilient the institutions that support it have ed.Even before the pandemic kicked off devolution infrastructure was under unprecedented pressure.#:London based news reports contributing to confusion about dferent lockdown rules in devolved nationsWhen the Scottish Affairs Committee conducted its inquiry into inter-governmental relations last year we found an infrastructure falling behind the development of devolution and hindered by disputes with devolved administrations feeling undermined and powerless.During the pandemic it is perhaps not surprising that barely any of this infrastructure has been utilised.The Joint Ministerial Committee, which should provide central co-ordination of the relationship between the four nations has essentially been forgotten. Instead, new informal relationships have emerged overtaking the#old formal structures.Supra- national bodies such as COBR and SAGE have become the main focus of inter-governmental engagement.# The common usage of the term lsquofour nationsrsquo, and the concept itself, is perhaps the most consequential innovation for devolution.Itrsquos taken this pandemic to highlight the reality of a devolved UK and to finally acknowledge that distinct political administrations even exist. The concept of lsquofour nationsrsquo suggests an equality and operational independence that has barely been acknowledged in the history of devolution.Now that this genie is out of the bottle it is unlikely to be put back. This new lexicon will necessitate approaching everything dferently in the future.But just as we are beginning to adjust to the new reality there is a#sense of lsquoback to business as usualrsquo creeping in. Where it seemed easy for the four nations to come together at the beginning of this emergency it is perhaps inevitable that coming out the other end would prove to be more problematic.How this ergence is handled will perhaps determine the ultimate success of the whole four nations experiment.After the conditional lsquotrucersquo the political temperature has also been turned up. As each Government faces identical issues, the remedies for which are equally problematic, they are feeling the heat of increased scrutiny.The acquisition of PPE, testing, the high rates of infection in care homes, the ongoing debate about when we should have entered lockdown are the issues that are increasingly consuming political debate in both Holyrood and Westminster.Dferent Governments are being held to account by dfering oppositions eventhe questions asked in one Parliament could easily be transferred and asked in the other. What is perhaps most ironic is that all the Governments seem to be basing their operational policy on the same science and information available to all four Governments.The most signicant juncture, though, was the UK Governmentrsquos arbitrary decision to initiate its own way out of lockdown and change the messaging to support its new approach. This drove a coach and horses through the general principle of an lsquoagreedrsquo four nations agenda.:Agenda: Pete Wishart MP on Scottish excellence in renewables being underminedWhere all this leaves devolution we will try and examine in our Committeersquos inquiry, but ato usual business is unlikely.

Here was the UK Government, mired in a scandal of double-standards and hypocrisy amid the pandemic, and yet the press was somehow in the firing line.On social media, terms like ldquoscum media trended. The press was accused of a witch-hunt against Cummings. We were doing our job ndash which by its simplest definition is holding power to account as honestly as we can ndash and for that we were hated by a vocal section of the country.:Neil Mackay: Johnson  Sturgeon  When it comes to coronavirus, they are the sameEmily Maitlis on Newsnight was attacked for comments she made on air which were simply factual: that Cummings broke the rules. The BBC panicked and distanced itself from her. So, in the end, the only person to get in trouble for the Cummings scandal has been a BBC journalist who spoke the truth.Of course, in the Cummings case, the attacks came from the right. The Brexiter camp was angry its man was in the spotlight. But anti-truth attacks come just as often from the left. A journalist can be decried as a stooge for capitalism one minute, and a Trotskyite the next. In Scotland, a journalist can be a figure of hate for nationalists today, and a figure of hate for unionists tomorrow. In a single afternoon, Irsquove been attacked as an ldquoSNP apologist or ldquoNat hack, and also part of the ldquoYoon MSM and a ldquounionist lickspittle. Over the years Irsquove been called a commie, a fascist, a republican, a loyalist, an MI agent, and a traitor to Britain. Like many journalists today, Irsquom whatever someone wants to call me when it suits their own hardline political agenda.When I hear these insults I recall it was President Richard Nixon who said ldquothe press is the enemy. Politicians of all dominant parties in Britain feed this idea ndash often retweeting attacks on journalism from the internetrsquos blogosphere. If you see a politician cosying up to a journalist then the journalist isnrsquot doing their job right.When a reporter becomes a figure of hate for one side, however, the other side adopts them as a spokesperson. Just look at the behaviour towards Piers Morgan. Hersquos baited the left for years, and the left came to hate him. Now, though, as he holds the Government accountable over coronavirus, hersquos suddenly a hero for the left hellip and the right hates him. Meanwhile, the left also discovered that Morgan has previously said things they agree with ndash like guns in America are bad. If the hate wasnrsquot so relentless it would be comic. Until the advent of social media, most journalists considered their job well donethey annoyed both sides of the political ide ndash that meant you had held everyone to account. Today, the simple act of trying to do your job to the best of your ability unleashes a tidal wave of abuse that goes on for days. Anybody would find it psychologically distressing.Perplexing predicament Why are we in this strange place where people who try to tell the truth as best they can are objects of hate The bottom line is that the internet has changed how information is consumed. Journalists break into the closed conservation loops that define the digital age. We are, as the phrase goes, the awkward squad. We donrsquot make things easy. The best of us try to draw out reason in any argument, and as Michael Gove said not so long ago ndash British people are tired of experts. Ideological polarisation means many now see ldquotheir politicians as heroes. Therersquos cultish elements to Brexit, Corbynism, Remainerism, and Scottish nationalism. People donrsquot like you questioning their heroes or faith. Itrsquos easier to hate the questioner. Wersquove been here before, though ndash and itrsquos been much worse. At times of political extremes ndash and wersquore most certainly living in a time of political extremism ndash writers and journalists often find themselves the whipping boy. Extremists and authoritarians donrsquot like people who disagree with them or speak their mind and the British media landscape is a rambunctious place where voices of all stripes are to be heard, both left, right and in between.In Germany, the term ldquoLuumlgenpresse has recently made a comeback. Luumlgenpresse was a Nazi slur meaning ldquolying press. It was a catch-all for the left and Jews. But the term was around long before the s. It first cropped up during the  revolution in Germany and was used to denounce the ldquoliberal press, as reformers demanded political change. Under Hitler, the phrase would lead to the death of the free press, and the murder of journalists in concentration camps. Today, the far-right Pegida movement in Germany likes to throw the term ldquoLuumlgenpresse around, as do alt-right neo-Nazis like Richard Spencer in America. Itrsquos not just the right that uses the term though. In the interwar period, Marxists deployed ldquoLuumlgenpresse against ldquobourgeois journalists. During the  revolts in Europe, far-left students in Germany described the mainstream media as ldquoLuumlgenpresse.What is Luumlgenpresse but an old-style term for Donald Trumprsquos ldquofake news  Itrsquos the same old authoritarian trope just played to a new tune. Whatrsquos ldquoLuumlgenpresseitrsquos not the attacks on journalism by those on the extremes of the Brexit and Scottish independence debates. In Scotland, unionists will cheer the Daily Mail and hiss at The National. Scottish nationalists will cheer The National and hiss at the Daily Mail. In truth, both papers simply cater for the political views of their readers. Papers which adopt a centre-ground, impartial approach get it from both sides because their journalism subjects both sides to the same scrutiny.  One of the reasons why the media now finds itself hated by hardliners of all persuasions is that in recent times the press has had to take on the role of an almost semi-official opposition when it comes to some Western governments. In America, Democrats have been incapable of holding Trump to account. CNN does the scrutiny. In Britain, Corbynrsquos Labour Party was incapable of holding the Tories accountable. It took journalists to root out the truth about Brexit, where Labour dithered. In Scotland, opposition parties seem incapable of holding the Government to account. In a country where some Yes voters will let the SNP away with almost anything as long as the independence cause is advanced, thatrsquos not a recipe for good Government. And so the press gets it in the neck for doing its job.Mistakes admitted Think of any recent modern scandal, and itrsquos the media which exposed it. Without journalism wersquod be blind. None of this, however, is to say that the media is without fault. Far from it. Indeed, the press has made many, many mistakes. Therersquos myriad serious problems ndash but you donrsquot fix problems by calling for the closure of newspapers and resulting redundancies, the dismantling of TV channels, the sacking of writers, and the imprisonment of editors, simply because you donrsquot like what theyrsquove said. Unless, of course, yoursquore an extremist.One of the biggest scandals of the British press was phone-hacking ndash but the scandal would never have come to light unless newspaper journalists investigated the issue. The press reports well on itself. The BBC, in particular, is a past master at self-inflicted punishment via reporting.We need to fix media problems, not wage war on journalism. Every social pillar in the West is creaking today ndash politics, the health service, bureaucracy, religion, policing, education, the military, finance and industry. The media shares the same problems. An intelligent national discussion about addressing failings in the media ndash just as we do with politics, policing, banking, schools and hospitals ndash is surely a better way to improve things than hate and threats.If there are concerns about balance, letrsquos address them. Surely a new mode of media ownership can be worked out. Is there enough plurality of voices  If not, letrsquos work on getting more ersity into newsrooms. How do we reassure the public about oversight without handing government a stick to beat the free press  If therersquos concern about clickbait then look at the funding model which stimulates that.No-one is saying the media is free from sin, but the narrative today is that the press is somehow the enemy when, in fact, the press is a necessary pillar of democracy. No pillar of democracy is rock steady these days but itrsquos not a good idea to try kicking any of them down as the whole edice might fall on your head.The best thing the media could do to build trust is to be more transparent. Explain why we do things, open more dialogue with readers ndash bring critics into newsrooms, show them how editorial decisions are taken.Once a society starts normalising attacks on journalism itrsquos on a slippery slope to ruin. Britain is a long way from that yet, but America isnrsquot. Trump has weaponised hatred of the press ndash just as hardcore Brexiters and Scottish nationalists have tried to do. But in America, Trump has been successful. What started with words turned into threats, and now we see journalists arrested for doing their job.: Neil Mackay:Dominic Cummings has played a blinder for the SNP and independenceYou may not like the political position of certain newspapers but the alternative to the press is the wild west of the internet where the biases, prejudices and conspiracy theories of often one untrained, and usually obsessive, blogger are what passes for editorial standards. Media law doesnrsquot cover the internet the way it covers the traditional media. Newspapers and broadcasters in Britain are held to some of the highest legal standards in the world. If I defame you, you sue me. If a TV report is biased, it gets sanctioned and shamed. There are no standards online.The politics of the Dailyare pretty far removed from my own, but it was Thewhich broke the expenses scandal story and helped hold MPs to account in a way politicians had never been before. Many in the online world find it impossible to dferentiate between fact and opinion. They see a columnist hold a position and conflate it with the position of an entire paper. Or they see a pundit on a talkshow and think thatrsquos the stance of the BBC. However, an edition of Question Time doesnrsquot represent the views of the BBC. I donrsquot represent the views of this newspaper. News is played straight in nearly all British newspapers. A headline isnrsquot the same as the story beneath.When it comes to opinion, though, itrsquos a free country and people can say what they want.Some parts of the media, particularly the BBC, havenrsquot helped themselves, however, by attempting to introduce faux balance into reporting. When it came to Brexit, for example, the economics of leaving were clear ndash it would be a disaster. It was almost impossible to find a reputable economist who would say Brexit was a good idea. So to provide ldquobalance, TV stations sought out pundits to weigh against the economists. In a way, TV couldnrsquot win. The law requires balance, but sometimes balance is absurd.In this case, balance meant that someonersquos feelings were judged as equal to another personrsquos facts. The same happened with climate change ndash the science was conclusive, but to achieve some strange idea of balance, preposterous climate deniers were brought on to news shows to give the counter argument.Confirmation bias At the heart of the angry anti-truth movement lies the problem of confirmation bias. Most people like to hear what makes them feel good. Until the advent of the internet that wasnrsquot possible. Newspaper and TV editors curated the news and let you know what was happening.Now you can retreat into your own self-curated bubble and unless you read intelligent papers, magazines and books, yoursquore unlikely to break out of the bubble. Look at how many people on social media in Scotland were shocked to learn of the Sheku Bayoh case in the wake of the George Floyd killing. If you donrsquot want to know these days, you can just look away ndash andsomething is forced upon you, then you can rail against it for interrupting your world view.Journalism quite literally bursts the bubble. Itrsquos invasive and uncomfortable. As politics has polarised ndash with many of the most extreme now getting their information from fellow extremists online in a mix of conspiracy theories, outright lies and propaganda ndash so anything which attempts to put facts first is seen as partisan. Trying to be impartial these days is often seen as an act of extreme partiality.Therersquos something known as the Eliza Effect. It involves a computer which has been programmed to basically repeat your questions back to you. One conversation went like this: Human: My boyfriend made me come here.Eliza: Your boyfriend made you come here Human: He says Irsquom depressed much of the time.Eliza: I am sorry to hear you are depressed.Human: Itrsquos true. Irsquom unhappy.Eliza: Do you think coming here will help you not to be unhappy Humans liked the computer because it fed back to them their own thoughts. The press does the opposite. It interrupts your thoughts and asks you to think things that might be uncomfortable. That triggers hate and threats.None of this is to compare whatrsquos happening in Britain to whatrsquos going on where in the world. Journalists are being killed with appalling frequency. Now coronavirus is being used to suppress freedom of the press even in EU states like Hungary. However, Britain has seen journalists murdered. Martin OrsquoHagan, who I knew, and Lyra McKee, were both killed by terrorists in Northern Ireland. A journalist in northern England, Amy Fenton, had to flee her home recentlywith her child after threats, simply for reporting a court case. The Coventryeditor Keith Perry has warned that ldquotruly appalling online abuse of journalists is becoming the ldquonew normal.The central battle of our time is between reason and emotion. That puts journalism slap bang in the middle of an ideological war. I have not written here in defence of any particular newspaper or broadcaster and I fully acknowledge the failings within my own industry. This is simply a heartfelt plea saying real journalism matters. A society at war with journalism is at war with itself and the biggest casualty will be the rights of citizens and their ability to access the truth."},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown-need-wear-bra","story":"For many, this means saying goodbye to a slower way of le and easing back into the grind of a daily commute. For me  Its ing to the shackles of wearing a bra.If you dont wear a bra typically ndash and I appreciate that large swathes of the population have no need for one ndash then it is perhaps dficult to fathom the feeling of liberation that not wearing a form-fitting undergarment brings.I realise the bra has powerful political connotations and to avoid wading into that particular quagmire let me state: this is all about comfort and sloth.How you feel about bras largely depends on how you view breasts: ornamental or utilitarian  Those in the former camp tend to spend a lot of their hard-earned cash on fancy underwear and outfits that showcase their assets.: Susan Swarbrick: Ah, garden centres how do I love thee  Let me count the waysThe second category is typied by arriving home of an evening ndash or at least we did when offices were still a thing ndash to cast off both coat and bra in quick succession, sighing in relief as blood flow again reaches the welts on each shoulder where the straps have been digging in.During lockdown, the only times I have worn a bra is while exercisingor on a video call with colleagues .More recently, I have worn a bra when receiving guests in the garden, putting it on with all the lacklustre enthusiasm of a Victorian lady being shoehorned into her corset.It is a necessary evil when outdoors, as I discovered to my peril during a conversation with a neighbour over the garden wall.The upshot was I had to keep my arms strategically crossed over my chest the entire time which made me look far more defensive when discussing encroaching tree roots than I genuinely was.An underwire snapped clean in half the other day which I like to think was an act of rebellion but is more likely a reflection on the poor nick of an ageing fleet of brassieres.: Susan Swarbrick: Theof s-style holidays  Count me inNor are bras my only nemesis.

It started with a jolt, the lad hung by his fingers as it climbed, then, when it hit a right-angled bend ft up, The Rat shrugged him off.After a two-week trial the owners were found not guilty of failing to provide sufficient training and supervision.The fairground was set in more than  acres of glorious undulating countryside, on a hill above the small town of Galston and the Irvine Valley. You can look down on the buildings and shops from the grounds and the school, Galston Academy, where many of the teenagers came for summer jobs helping in the park.The centrepiece of the site is the A-listed castle, now fenced around and dangerous as it cracks and crumbles and the vegetation smothers it. The centuries, and particularly the later years of neglect, have not been kind to Loudon Castle.The castle is steeped in history and conflict, although the majority of it was built in the th century, adding to and engulfing the th-century remnants and the th-century keep.It had over  apartments inside, with an impressive ft library and , rare books. The structure was dominated by the main tower, now showing a formidable crack.Loudon Castle was known, in its time, as the Windsor of Scotland.It was originally owned by the Crawford family in the th century, but passed by marriage to the Campbells.In , Sir Hugh Campbell of Loudon assassinated Gilbert Kennedy, nd Earl of Cassilis, the reason for which is likely to be revenge for the burning down of the original castle by the Kennedys in a clan feud, or perhaps the second event was precipitated by the first.The Campbells were royalists and supported Charles  in the English Civil War. Loudon was besieged by Oliver Cromwellrsquos armies in , during which part of the original castle was destroyed, and finally surrendered by General Monck. It is said that a portrait of Charles had its nose cut off by Cromwellrsquos men.Robert Burns and his brother Gilbert farmed land belonging to the Earl of Loudon, Mossgiel Farm at Mauchline, which is now an organic farm delivering milk and dairy produce to the surrounding area.The present castle on the main estate was designed by Archibald Elliot for the then Countess of Loudon in , with additions to it in .One million trees were planted on the surrounding land, some of which were imported from Europe and America. The four-acre walled garden was turned into a mini-theme park for smaller children within the larger one, called Piratersquos Cove, with an inverted ship, wheels and merry-go-rounds. It is now locked and chained behind the high walls.In , on the eve of the castle being handed over to the War Office to be used as a billet for troops, it burned down again, and, without the funds to repair, has never been renovated and was left to ruin for nearly eight decades.The theme park, operated by a London-based company, opened in , and attracted around , visitors a year.When Codona retired in  it was bought for pound. million by another showman, one of the Dutch brothers who had run Dreamland Amusement Park in Margate. Johannes Hendrikus Christoffel Bembom is known as Henk. He invested a further poundm into the park and moved most of the Margate rides north.Some of them can be seen in the  Only Fools And Horses Christmas special, \"The Jolly Boys Outing\", where Del Boy, Rodney and Grandad visit Dreamland.After seven years, in September , Henk Bembom closed the park, with the loss of  permanent jobs and  seasonal ones.He blamed bad weather, the rise in VAT and the opening of free attractions ndash like the Burns Centre in Ayr and the Transport Museum in Glasgow ndash making it ldquono longer economically viable.In , four years after the park closed, plans were submitted for a massive poundm housing and leisure development on the  acres.The ambitious plans included , new homes,  holiday lodges, glamping pitches, indoor sporting facilities, a sub-tropical water park ndash even a distillery.Given the go-ahead it would enable the stabilisation and eventual restoration of the castle, it was said, which the developers envisage turning into a five-star hotel.The plans were rejected by the local council, again by a reporter to a public inquiry and, after being \"called in\", finally by the Scottish Government last year, over fears it could damage the historic site and that the proposals for housing were inadequate.There was ldquono certainty, said the Scottish Government, that the housing plan would allow the castle to be restored.The local East Ayrshire Council now wants there to be some kind of leisure development which will also save the castle, and is planning a consultation process.And there it stands.Behind the ornate locked gates, and up the long drive and past the booths where visitors used to pay their entrance money, the ruined and dangerous castle is visible through the metal fencing and the greenery overwhelming it.Whether it can be saved seems unlikely."},{"url":null,"title":"talking-rabbish-bard-bed-bag-revels","story":"Apart from misspelling ldquosleeve, no one knew what he was on about with his ldquoravellrsquod. Unravelled, yes. Thatrsquos a word folk say. But ravelled  There was a Maurice Ravel, a French composer, but he lived long after Shakespeare, and his name was pronounced Rav-ELL, stress on the second syllable.Shakespearersquos ldquoravel is pronounced the same way as ldquoRevel, the popular chocolate-coated confectionary with assorted centres, where the stress is on the first syllable.Shakespeare clearly loved the sweets, as he laments at one point: ldquoOur Revels now are ended. But he was also clearly fond of sleep as he goes on about it quite a bit in his sitcoms. ldquoTo sleep, quoth he, ldquoperchance to dream. Aye, therersquos the rub. Rub  What rub  Vickrsquos The man was clearly a mooncalf but I agree with him about the centrality of sleep in human le. Alas, as the public prints reported this week, the coronavirus has been wrecking it for many people.Thatrsquos a tragic problem which I will try to address here. Indeed, it is my earnest hope that, before the end of this article, I will have left many of you asleep.In a survey by Ipsos Mori,  per cent of peeps said their sleeps had become worse during the lockdown. Thatrsquos bad news, as experts say lack of asleep affects your wotsname. It also blooters your mood, concentration and immune system. And your memory. Did I say that already Insomnia: itrsquos a thundering nuisance. So, what can be done about it  Some citizens misunderstand the expression ldquosleep tight and gargle vats of grog before staggering to Slumberland. But, while drink gets you off to sleep, it wakes you in the middle of the night with a thumping heid and twinges of regret about your tweet agreeing with David Icke.Once awake, you can never get back off again as you fret about money, work and whether the baby Jesus really was God. Techniques such as the :: method ndash breathe in through your beak for a count of four hold for two out for four ndash are supposed to help. They do not.Nothing does. The whole thing is capricious. One day, you walk by the sea and sleep like a log all night. Next day, you walk by the sea and donrsquot get a wink. One night, you soak your heid in lavender oil and sleep like a baby. Next night, you find your heid is stuck to the pillow and you canrsquot breathe.Establish a routine  Makes no dference. Make your bedroom a haven  Hopeless. Have a bath beforehand  Works one night, not the next.Of late, Irsquove found that changing my sleeping position, so that my teddy bear is in my right hand rather than my left, has helped.

Whenever you feel yoursquove at last found your ideal home, He reveals a noisy neighbour, rising damp or a planning application for a nuclear abattoir next door. Never gives you a break.Itrsquos the same with sleep, though here he gives you a break you donrsquot want. That said, new evidence suggests wersquore meant to sleep in two periods. In medieval times, during the break, people would indulge in salacious awfulness.However, as thatrsquos banned under the coronavirus sexual distancing rules, you should better use the time to read or write that novel listen properly to music paint your Airfix kit.Donrsquot curse the hiatus. Make the most of it. Or at least make a cup of tea which, as Shakespeare wishes hersquod said, ldquomakes right your heid, unravels your sleeves, and gives your soul a good rub.Bier hereI WILL be quite candid with you here and confess Irsquom ambivalent about the idea of turning British pubs into German-style bierkellers as a way of getting round the coronavirus restrictions.Better than nothing, I suppose, anditrsquos all there is, Irsquoll take it. But, still, I fancy the long, open benches are too communal for me and perhaps more suited to the tribal nature of the Teuton.Once, in Holland, I walked into a bierkeller type of set-up and found the entire clientele ndash well over a hundred ndash swaying together and singing The Birdie Song.

There were several groups of cyclists not maintaining distance, people chatting close together, and an empty bus, unusual for London even on a Sunday morning.Host Sophy Ridge appeared to catch the Minister by surprise when she asked how many black people were in Boris Johnsonrsquos Cabinet.ldquoTherersquos a whole series of people from a black and minority ethnic background, said Mr Hancock, citing the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the Home Secretary, Priti Patel. When Ridge interrupted to ask about black members of Cabinet, Mr Hancock said he had previously served with Kwasi Kwarteng, former Parliamentary Under Secretary of State in the Department for Exiting the European Union, and now Energy Minister.ldquoBoris Johnson has a very good record on this, said Mr Hancock. ldquoIt brings people in and listens to a ersity of views.

We are rightly proud in the Northern Isles of having some of the highest standards of produce in the world. Farmers and consumers alike deserve peace of mind about fair standards and fair prices for the food we produce and eat.He continued: “I am astonished that the government has leapt directly from denying earlier this year that lower food standards would be permitted to defending this policy turn wholeheartedly. Undercutting farmers and crofters is not what was promised about the “brave new world” of future trade deals.“It is concerning that the government seems more interested in carrying water for Donald Trump and his #America First# mentality than in supporting our farmers. The government should be accountable to the people they represent, not the whims of US negotiators.”Speaking in the House earlier in the week, Mr Carmichael highlighted the potential impact to farmers and crofters in the Northern Isles: “I would like to hear what the Government’s response is to press reports today that the Government are set to open British markets to food products produced to lower US standards as part of the trade deal with Donald Trump. This was the rhetoric we were given by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster: he told us that there would never be chlorinated chicken on our plate.“Now, in fact, we hear that as a consequence of the so-called dual tarf process it is quite possible that we will see such products being imported to this country. In fact, we are told that the Secretary of State for International Trade is arguing that these tarfs should be reduced to zero over  years, giving farmers time to adjust to the new “normal”.“For the farmers and crofters in my constituency, it will be a hard reality for them to survive in. Because we are a long distance from the market, we have not gone for mass-produced food. We have sought to improve the quality of the products we have and put into market with a view to export. Tarfs on those export markets will be absolutely fatal to the agricultural interests of the highlands and islands.”Responding for the government, the Paymaster General, Penny Mordaunt MP, said: “I fully understand why he may be sceptical about trusting the government, but trust the people. They value animal welfare, we should trust the consumer and there are massive opportunities for our farmers for rest of world trade.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, we are asking you, for now, to please stay within, or close to, your own local area. And don’t use public transport unless it is absolutely necessary.”The first steps out of lockdown could only involve “careful and cautious” changes, she said.In Orkney, this means that travel on public bus and inter-island ferry and air services will continue to be for essential reasons only during Phase One, with passenger numbers severely restricted as a result of and in line with social distancing requirements.Across Scotland it is assessed that social distancing will reduce transport capacity by  per cent –  per cent and this figure is very much in line with the assessment in Orkney for our ferries and local bus services.During Phase One, there will be no changes to the current timetables for local bus, ferry and inter-island air services.For Orkney Ferries, the aim is to help protect residents in the isles from the risk of infection – along with the crews who operate the service – and to ensure that the ferries can continue to run and deliver freight and other essential supplies.The Scottish Government’s new guidance, published on Tuesday , will help public transport operators and passengers prepare for the further lting of lockdown restrictions at a future date.Detailed information from the government on the newly announced Public Transport Guidance has been sent to the council. Careful consideration is being given to how this might apply locally when the move to Phase Two begins.The guidance does state that people should wear face coverings when using public transport and further information on the council’s expectations on this will be provided in due course.The government has acknowledged that there will be geographic challenges in implementing the guidance and that there can be no ‘one size fits all’ to the approach taken across Scotland.The government’s latest travel advice is available here: https:www.transport.gov.scot coronavirus-covid- transport-transition-plan advice-on-how-to-travel-safely copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here is how some companies have been helped, and what is available.CASE STUDYIt was a week that felt like a year for Neil Lapping, chief adventure officer at Glasgow-based Macs Adventure, as the crippling impact of the Coronavirus on the travel industry became clear. The thriving guided tour business, accustomed to  per cent year-on-year growth, first saw international bookings collapse before a deluge of cancellations from domestic customers. Neil said: “It was emotionally devastating. We went from a growing and profitable business to zero revenue coming. “It was a week that felt like a year and I was in tears again and again.currently enlisted. The company also received £m from Barclays from the UK Government-backed Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme .“We have been able to retain our  staff in the UK through the furlough scheme. We would have been unable to pay them with zero revenue coming in. The CBILS has allowed us to cover our overheads including rent, rates and IT systems.”“Once we made a furlough claim the funds were released quickly and it is great news that it has been extended until October.”Neil said that Macs Adventure was well-positioned for the recovery in the travel market and that the Coronavirus had accelerated industry trends. He said: “It will take us between three to five years to rebuild the business however we are very well-placed to recover. “The market for impactful and active travel is growing.”Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers:Details of the support available to businesses across the UK can be found at www.gov.uk coronavirus business-supportcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The minister has agreed to look at Mr McArthur’s suggestion and highlighted that the government is looking at a range of ways to offer support to farmers.Following the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “The COVID- outbreak has forced ious initiatives planned by SNH and the Orkney Greylag Goose Management group to be put on hold. As a result, local farmers have been faced with having to spend more time and resources trying to keep resident greylag geese numbers under control.“I know from seeing first-hand the impact that greylag geese can have on crops and farmland. Over recent years, as the resident Greylag population has increased, so too has the damage and the cost of trying to address the problem. “It would seem sensible, therefore, to use any funding earmarked for the earlier control measures to help reduce the financial burden on farmers having to take steps themselves. This could include contributing to the cost of cartridges, but there may be other options available.“I’m pleased that the minister responded positively to this suggestion and agree to explore the options for providing such support, as well as wider efforts to bring Orkney’s resident Greylag goose population down to more sustainable levels.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

If born in Delhi then you might be Hindi or Sikh.Kenyans are more likely to be Christian.In Scotland, your type of Christianity might also depend on location catholics and protestants coming from fairly well-defined geographical areas.Of course, culture is more than religion, but even for non-adherents and atheists, it is often a signicant part of the richness of the societies we live in.I was in Bali, Indonesia earlier this year during the festival of Galungan.The place was literally dripping with decorations.Ornate and huge ‘penjor’ lined the roads and adorned buildings, taller than telegraph poles and more prevalent, they were beautully twisted and plaited from palm fronds.Shrines and offerings were everywhere. It was vibrant, colourful and beautul. It was a religious festival, but totally embedded in the culture of the Balinese, in the way Christmas is in Scotland.Balinese people are among the friendliest I have come across in all my travels, a genuine and warmth in their demeanour.Balinese folk are brown in colour, because it is very sunny in Indonesia they have evolved to have more melanin, and therefore more protection against the sun.We don’t choose the colour of our skin, or the culture we are born into, but what we do with our lot is a product of our upbringing, our wider society experience and everything that has happened to us.Most of our behaviour is due to nurture not nature, and is down to choice.Our values and empathies lie in our reaction to our experience and learning from consequence. The problem stems in that much of that experience lies out with our control.If we are black, poor and have been persecuted by institutional society since birth, we might take to the streets.When pepper sprayed, or met with water canon, rubber bullet or tear gas, we might resort to throwing rocks, petrol bombs.Windows might be broken, we might loot.If our role model father figure was a gun toting white supremacist, we might believe ourselves to have a greater entitlement than those of a dferent colour.We would be wrong.These are extreme examples # rationalising and trying to understand the actions of others is fraught with generalisation and perhaps cliché.We can never know what makes a person act the way they do, and we can only imagine being in their shoes, and seeing through the lens of their eyes.What is as tragic as a police officer killing another human being in a slow, seemingly deliberate fashion, is that a society, a culture and its institution can produce someone capable and accepting of such an action.I hope the killer will be brought to justice, and that a grieving family can find peace and forgiveness, but more importantly can we heal the society that produces this behaviour.Most of the ills are due to poverty, deprivation, and the inequality of opportunity.Fear and ignorance is layered on top, with greed and entitlement. Power normally resides with the rich, who want to stay rich.The cry is that we are all the same underneath, black, white, brown yellow, and yet we are all dferent, unique, products of vastly dferent culture, geography, upbringing, beliefs and experience.We are both the same and both dferent, and this confusing contradiction should be embraced, celebrated and above all respected.Scotland is known for celebrating ersity, but it is more than the music, the festivals, the ceremonies and the food, it is the people and their attitudes and their experience we should celebrate.It may be sometime before visitors from other continents arrive back to the Highlands in any number, but our communities as hosts are in a perfect situation to embrace the cultures brought and above all respect both dferences and similarities.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1942-2020-Stalag-9C-No-1401Original.jpg","title":"shinty pipers to commemorate the heroes of st","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine June , was to become one of the most important dates in the history of their regiments.It was to become, arguably the equivalent of the battle of Festubert in World War I which had a colossal and catastrophic impact of shinty playing communities.Both battles are seared in the memory of many families still involved with the game.The contribution through piping towards the special commemoration which has been organised for next Tuesday is being organised by Shinty Memories Scotland, the project which uses archive material to help people with dementia or suffering from isolation and loneliness.Shinty Memories will also be telling some of the stories involving the period after the battle.Shinty Memories ambassador John MacKenzie said: “The name St Valery is right up there with all he battles which have had tragic consequences for many families who were, and still are, involved with shinty.“Some of our greatest players and iniduals were involved at St Valery.

course, it’s a good thing.Very often we tend to forget where we feel we belong, particularlywe have been ‘transplanted’ where, either through natural migration or simply not being allowed back to your own bed because you are perceived as a walking , potential germ time-bomb.Despite Gaina being willing to take the daily risk, and my being eternally grateful that she is Marvin Gaye was wrong.Wherever I lay myhat, it’s certainly not my home.I lived in the centre of Stornoway in a previous le.It was tolerable because the front door of the Royal Hotelwas the distance of a free-kick from just outside the penalty box away.Barring that, the Wee Co-op and the Trading Post provided hugely comforting ‘book ends’, sandwiched as I was, comfortably in between.When nary an eyebrow was raised when you ordered a can of Special Vat cider at  in the morning, paying with a handful of change where a p was undoubtedly king of the finds the determination of where my ‘home’ was largely depended on proximity to alcohol.Luckily things have changed.It doesn’t take much to calibrate where you truly belong.I dare say that for each and every one of us that calibration is measured dferently, using dferent tools and metrics.Each to their own.There are bound to be many for whom the lockdown has heightened their state of anxiety.Townies, I respectfully suggest, much more than others.Waking on Sunday, after a night burning not much rubber, to the noise of whatever it was that had driven herself indoors from her crocheting in the sun I could feel the sap rise.A terrace in the capital is no place when the sun shines brightly and the neighbours are Status Quo fans.The decision was immediate.It required just the two connected synapses to flicker briefly.“Pack what you need, we’re going to Point”.As she continued with the never-ending blanket in the warmth and safety of the Republic, I decided to head for the shore.Something I don’t do nearly often enough is walk through my own village, in my own time, grown increasingly comfortable in my own head.With a colander on the cranium, attached to many electrodes and a Sinclair ZX , a compass and a barometer handy I reckon my epicentre would be found somewhere between my front door, Shinigeadh, Loch an Duin and Allt Diobadal.Shinigeadh was picture perfect.The walk down to the geodha was spectacular.Even the sheep knew I wasn’t a tourist.I’d wax more lyrical, but I know you’re already jealous.‘Mata’ MacIver, in his wonderful monthly column, ‘My Portnaguran’ in our local magazinealludes to the importance of our local football team when it comes to our sense of community.Guess who were amongst the very first to respond and offer their services when the Covid crisis struck Along with the people you’d expectthey were the first to coordinate support to anyone in need.Never mind the locally elected representatives and the Community Council we were left standing whilst the people of the Roo did what decent folk do.By the time we caught up, deliveries and safety nets were already in place.It was happening all over these islands and the people who don’t require prompting to do the right thing and never stop to look for recognition or thanks.It’s not what they’re about or why they get involved.But can we take the time to recognise each and every single one of them next time we step outside to clap The whole weekend was confusing for many unable to restrain themselves following weeks of conflicting messages.There was, of course, theof golf and fishing as part of the easing of the lockdown but throw in Dominic Cummings, the huge sense of relief at ‘something’ positive happening, no new cases in the Western Isles for nearly six weeks plus spectacular weather, and you could feel the collective engines revving.We should have been thinking of going from neutral into first gear as part of a gradual process back to a semblance of normality .What we saw was akin to the starting grid of a Formula  race.The lights went from red to green and, with added Buckfast and MD , a little bit of mayhem ensued.It was, in hindsightentirely predictable.A scientist, rocket or otherwise, wasn’t required.Luckily, or unluckily, the weather has ed to normal and, after some warnings, people recognised that their actions were premature and inappropriate.This ‘thing’ isn’t over and we need to remain vigilant.Complacency is our biggest danger, still.Let’s get back to keeping it real.Truth be told, we couldn’t wait.After a ten week lay-off, it was never going to be pretty.Especially for those of us who might still tend to struggle having played ten rounds in ten days.Naturally I started with a par at the, stroke-index one, hugely troublesome, opening hole at Stornoway.I may only ever manage a handful of fours in a season at the ‘Castle’, so the huge joke was on me and playing partner, Alan ‘Biddley’ MacLeod.‘Bid’s’ tee shot had last been seen heading left towards the Woodlands Centre and I fully expected to follow suit.I managed the plumb centre of the trees on the right, but miraculously played some decent recovery golf, albeit only briefly.It wasn’t so much a case of ‘it’s downhill after this’, which it certainly was, more a case of ‘who cares, isn’t this wonderful ’.Much like halitosis, any golf is better than no golf at all.We kept score, briefly, before it all became a bit too much and we decided to enjoy ourselves.The course was full.The sun was shining.Genuinely it was hotter than it had been in Florida last October.‘Things’, generally couldn’t be better.We will, naturally, spend a couple of weeks ‘acclimatising’ before we plunge headlong into competitive golf proper.That night my legs and feet ached, my back required some WD, but a’ bhalaich, I was a happy bunny.I wasn’t alone.Who was keeping score anyway Colin MacRitchie’s playing partner on Saturday, that’s who.Whilst some of us require several layers of cobwebs to be removed before we can be considered ‘contenders’ the talented require nothing more than a robust practice swing.Starting with a bogey, , at the ‘Castle’, nobody could have predicted the explosives to follow.Yes it was just a ‘bounce’ round and yes, we were still only playing off the yellow tees: but that didn’t detract much from the incredulity with which his card was greeted.From the second hole he went birdie, birdie, birdie, birdie, eagle, birdieto be ‘out’ in a breath-taking, -under, .He started back with yet another brace of birdies before completely losing form and racking up ‘just’ seven straight pars.  #         # Going round anywhere, at any time, in  blows is a stunning achievement.It certainly posts a warning to the other serious contenders for the summer season and the ‘majors’ ahead, however truncated it they may be.The Scarista faithful, too, were busy finding themselves at the weekend.Nobody was too keen to blow anything resembling the remotest trumpet, regards any semi-official scoring but the sense I got was that greenkeeper James Dunne was possibly the man to keep a close eye on.He spent the weekend asking about the bounce and loft on wedges.“ or  degrees loft with - degree bounce ”, he queried.Billy Fraser, who actually does know what he was talking about, chipped in with what appeared to be sound, indeed polite, advice.‘Bounce is your friend’ Captain Kuna opined.Now there’s a man in touch with his inner Barbara Woodhouse.Having latterly abandoned the notion of flailing around with a driver, or any fairway woods, James has foundthat his scoring has dramatically improved.The ‘Essence of Harris’ Trophy this Saturday may well be his opportunity to demonstrate his new-found Karma.Benbecula threw themselves straight back into competitive action with their May Medal last Saturday. Donald MacKay won with a nett , two shots ahead of Dami Steele on .Both qualy for the end of season gold medal.On Tuesday they began the season-long Order of Merit with a Willie Monkwin. Dami continued his runner-up habit.Down at Askernish they’re still probably trying to get over the shock of my naming it as my favourite course on ‘Spors na Seachdain’.I’ve been lucky enough to have played some wonderful courses these past -odd years but the South Uist links still ‘does it’ for me every time.I even considered becoming a member this year, along with Stornoway and Harris before Covid took a hold.Too far Maybe I should approach the Tiumpan Head grazings committee.What a course that would make.You’d never get me out of Point.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3149276.jpg--.jpg?1591018601000\n","title":"re open kits for town centre shops","story":"Around  ‘Retail COVID- Support Packs’ will be distributed to town centre businesses in Ballymena to help to ensure a safe re-opening to the public.The pack will include guidance on social distancing and infection control, posters for display, checklists to ensure employee and customer safety, useful contacts and infection control products.Council is working with its partners to develop a recovery plan for the three town centres across the Mid  East Antrim Borough.

Alliance, the SDLP and Ulster Unionists are also likely to be cautious.Mrs Dodds said that the economic consequences of not opening for business would be colossal.She has written to Health Minister Robin Swann, who is responsible for Northern Ireland#s coronavirus regulations. The Department of Health will now order risk assessment modelling.Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride and Chief Scientic Officer Professor Ian Young are expected to give their views to the Executive before Monday#s meeting.The DUP move comes as the Taoiseach announced a fast-tracking of the Republic#s journey out of lockdown, with all shops allowed to reopen on Monday unless they are in a shopping centre.Mrs Dodds said we had to move more swtly out of lockdown. Every month that passes with signicant restraints on trading is the equivalent of a large scale recession, she said. Northern Ireland output is at least %-% down. I have never tried to sugar-coat this. I fear that the recovery will not be as quick as the decline.The greatest help we as an Executive can provide to people is to allow our economy toagain in a manner that protects both staff and customers. On that basis I have requested that the Executive considers allowing the wider retail sector to open up and begin trading again.The DUP minister said she wanted to see as much of our economy open as possible.She added: Obviously this reopening must be in line with our knowledge about the transmission of the virus and consistent with the medical advice. However, as long as shops, cafes, restaurants, bars and attractions can open up in a safe and sensible way then we should move ahead with that phased reopening.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseA sign encouraging social distancing of two metres FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappA sign encouraging social distancing of two metresMrs Dodds said that the Executive had big decisions to make on social distancing.She noted that UK, Irish, US and Swiss government advice was that people should remain two metres apart.In Germany, the Netherlands and Poland it was one-and-a-half metres. Sweden, Finland, Norway and Austria have adopted the WHO-recommended one metre. New research funded by the WHO suggests that keeping one metre apart can reduce the likelihood of catching Covid by some %, Mrs Dodds said.It is generally accepted that we will be co-existing with this virus for some time. The dference between one and two metres will dramatically impact on workplaces such as a production line on a shop floor or a hotel#s ability to hold s such as wedding receptions, conferences or banquets. Likewise it impacts how many customers a restaurant or bar can safely serve at one time, or how many people can visit a theatre, travel in a bus or sit in a cafe. These are the balance of judgments that the Executive has to make.Businesses have been pressing for a relaxation of guidelines. However, a study published this week suggested that moving from two to one metres could signicantly increase the risk of infection.The Lancet study, which reached its conclusions from an analysis of nine pieces of research, put the risk of infection at % when people stand more than one metre away, compared with %within one metre.

Archdeacon David Huss, who is originally from Lisburn, took to the roads of south Donegal on his bicycle this week and will keep up the pace for as long as needed. Due to the current Covid- restrictions, the -year-old has not seen many of his flock in his Donegal group of parishes since the last services were held in churches on March .However, he has been able to keep in touch with them via phone and video calls, alongside online worship. He is now encouraging them to come to their doors and say hello from a distance of at least two metres. That also means he will not be accepting any cups of tea or entering any houses on his rounds. I was missing seeing people face-to-face, he explained.We#re now permitted to do #outdoor# get-togethers as long as we#re not in groups of more than four, so the idea came: why not do it by bike  Archdeacon Huss said his GP we Beverly had a hand in his two-wheeled ministry. The actual idea of going out on the bike was probably hers, so she#s very pleased to see me breaking away from my sedentary lestyle and getting exercise, he added.Day one of his visits around his parishes of Donegal Town, Killymard, Lough Eske and Laghey took place on Wednesday, which coincidentally was World Bicycle Day. I#ll be setting off each day at about pm and finishing who-knows-when, he said.From next week I#ll crank it up to longer distances there are a few hills in the parish but I#m spreading it over several days, so I should be fine.The father-of-three is at pains to point out that he will be observing social distancing at all times while on his travels. I hope to wave to people, stop at the gate, say hello, hopefully say a quick prayer. I won#t go into people#s houses or accept cups of tea, not until I#m permitted to do so, and that won#t be for the foreseeable future. Physical distancing doesn#t mean spiritual distancing, though, so it#s important to keep in pastoral contact. Doing it by bike is a great way of doing it, it#s good for my health and fitness, and it may create a bit more interest.

Every day we put them in a dferent themed pose except for Sundays when we always do church, Sunday school and creches, and then on Saturdays the theme will be sport of one kind or another.Now we are in the winding down stage and the bears will be going into hibernation. We have decided to repeat our top ten favourites including Northern Ireland Bake Off and Wimbledon.When the Belfastfirst covered what the couple were doing - the idea initially was to put a smile on the faces on people walking past their home, but now Mr Corrin said he and his we have benefited so much as well.Mr Corrin continued: My we loves teddy bears and I always got her a Harrods bear as part of her Christmas present when I used to go back and forward to London on business, so now she has  and around  dferent bears in total. We have been so fortunate with the weather but I have put the gazebo up in case it rains because these bears are very precious.My we is shielding and because she is I am too, so we haven#t been beyond our garden gate in ten weeks. We started this because we wanted to put a smile on people#s faces. As the weeks have passed we have heard more and more about the effects being in lockdown is having on people#s mental health and even our Minister said how beneficial this has been for everyone, he said.It has been of great benefit to us too because we have enjoyed seeing people saying hello from the other side of the gate and of course knowing we have raised so much for Marie Curie has been the icing on the cake.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: PSNI to seek prosecution of organisers of Black Lives Matter protests Madeleine McCann: Holidaying family from Louth may have witnessed abduction#I want to do it as best as I can and that#s me as a human being speaking, not me as Trimble speaking# - David Trimble#s son #humbled# to be new mayorBelfast woman accused of hitting infant with glass appears in court#We deserve to know about our parents# - Siblings who were abandoned in tartan bags on both sides of Irish border say story is far from over,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Police also seized a handgun and ammunition during the searches in the Ballymagroarty area on Friday and Saturday.The police believe the handgun is the same type of weapon used in the murder of journalist Lyra McKee last year. It is a main line of investigation that the weapons belong to the New IRA. Derry City and Strabane District Commander Emma Bond said: “This operation was designed specically to find items we believed were being stored by violent dissident republicans in the Ballymagroarty area and which posed a serious and imminent risk to the community.We were able to locate and safely remove a command-wire initiated bomb, a handgun and a quantity of ammunition. A strong line of enquiry is that these munitions belong to the New IRA. They have now been seized and will be subject to rigorous forensic examination in the coming days and weeks.The weapon found appears to be of the same type and calibre as the gun we believe was used to murder Lyra McKee, however at this time we are not in a position to say whether this is the murder weapon.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseChildren’s ‘den’ near to where the bomb and gun were found FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappChildren’s ‘den’ near to where the bomb and gun were foundDC Bond said the gun will be subject to extensive forensic testing in the coming days and weeks to determinethere is a link between the weapon and Lyra McKee#s murder. She added: The fact that these items were left close to a populated area, and particularly on land where children are known to play, yet again underlines the total lack of regard these violent terrorist criminals have for their own communities.These people are so singularly focused on murdering police officers that they do not careothers - men, women, children, families - are caught up in their evil plots. The community is simply collateral damage.The senior officer said violent dissident republicans are immersed in a constant campaign to kill police.This is the reality we live with every day, and yet everyday police officers come into work, they go out into communities like Ballymagroarty and they work to build relationships and tackle the issues that matter to local people, DC Bond said. NI Policing Board chair Doug Garrett praised the search operation.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseProximity of scene to local homes FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappProximity of scene to local homes“I welcome that these deadly items have been safely recovered, but share the concern voiced by others at the reckless disregard of the Dissidents in leaving weapons of harm in a community area, he said.Those who primed this bomb had the likely intent of killing our police officers, but they really have no care about anyone  who may be harmed in the process. Despite the clear threat faced, we thank our officers for their continued work in the community to tackle and respond to issues of public concern.The police need the support of the public to stop further acts of terrorism.

The following day, the story of the baby left in a driveway appeared on the front page of the #Belfast #, but no one came forward to claim him.Across the Border, six years later, Donal Boyle, a lorry driver from Macroom, Co Cork, was on his way to Belfast when he stopped in Dundalk to make a call. Inside a phonebox close to a local hospital, he found a red tartan duffel bag with a baby girl stowed safely inside. The little girl was wearing a handmade dress and the bottle placed next to her was still warm. Again, efforts to trace the baby#s parents proved unsuccessful.Without birth records or parents, the two abandoned babies were adopted and grew up as David McBride and Helen Ward.They both led happy lives, David in Lisburn and Helen in Dublin, but fundamental questions about identity, about when and where they were born, meant a reckoning with the past was inevitable.When I was , I asked my [adoptive] dad, Helen told the Irish Independent this week. He said, #Let sleeping dogs lie# and I think he said that because he wanted to protect me.Helen, now , made several fruitless attempts to discover more about her origins, including a  interview with the Irish Independent which led her to Donal Boyle and an appearance on RTÉ#s #Liveline#. Separately, David launched an appeal for information on the radio in  and appeared on the Gerry Kelly TV show in the North, also in vain.I had sort of given up a wee bit, said David, speaking from his home in Birmingham this week.I did a newspaper article in  but that was it then. It is like hitting your head against a brick wall sometimes, so you go through phases.Despite several news stories at the time, no one ever made the connection about the tartan bags. Helen just south of the Border, David north of it.That is until Ariel Bruce, a social worker who has made a career of tracking down long-lost relatives, entered the frame.My sister encouraged me to send my DNA profile to Ariel to seeshe could find a match, said David.Separately, Helen had entered her own DNA on to the system a year before, a th birthday present from her best friend Eimear.It was the best gt anyone has ever given me, Helen said.Through the advances of modern science, there then followed a remarkable discovery. When Ariel put David#s DNA into the online database, she discovered he had a perfect match.Not a parent in fact, but a sister, a full sister. It was Helen.Ariel had never come across anything like it before, said David.Helen doesn#t know this, but I was asked to send a second profile. I think they wanted another test because at that point they had spoken to Helen and they wanted to confirm exactly what they found. I ended up doing two DNA tests.What followed was an emotional meeting, featured last weekend on #Long Lost Lives, Born Without a Trace#, an ITV programme that tracks down lost relatives. In an extraordinary moment captured on screen, David and Helen met for the first time.Tears were shed, stories exchanged. And they were left with more questions than answers. The show has not been broadcast in Ireland, prompting the siblings to tell their story here, in the hope that they can piece together the missing parts of a puzzle that kept them apart for years.We know there are people in Ireland who know something, he said. We would appeal to those people to come forward and confide in us. We deserve to know about our parents.As the programme revealed, when researchers trawled an ancestry DNA site, they found profiles that matched Helen and David. Family members connected to both their parents had uploaded their DNA, leading the team to establishing who their mother and father were.David and Helen#s mother was Catholic who had a love affair spanning almost  years with their father, a married man with  children. Both lived in Dublin.Our father was a musician who played in a Dublin dancehall and I presume that#s how they met, said David. Our mother worked in retail. She was from Kerry but had moved to Dublin. We know little about their relationship as it stands.Both birth parents have sadly passed away. Their father died in , aged , and their mother in  at the age of .The siblings have also learned that their mother was  when she had David, and  when she gave birth to Helen - never marrying or having any more children.Illegitimacy and the religious ide sealed David and Helen#s fates their mother#s death three years ago meant some mysteries would always remain unsolved, some wounds impossible to heal.If we had met her before she passed, I probably would have wanted to know why she did what she did, said Helen.From that question you would probably get answers as to the times, as to the circumstances, as to her choices.Out of respect for two families they are still trying to get to know, both David and Helen have asked that, for now, their birth parents are not named.They have four older sisters and  older brothers on their father#s side and extended family members on their mother#s side, and they are still making tentative steps to learn more about each parent.We are hoping this will help jog memories, said David.In Kerry, someone might recall something. With a bit of luck, it might jog the memories of our mother#s side too. People might say, #Look, we have kept this under the carpet for too long, we need to come out and reveal this, particularly because Helen and David need to know.# Our mother and father have passed away. They were our parents and we have a right to know what went on between them.Central to their shared story, the siblings believe, is the Ireland of the s, a time and place that was a cold house for unmarried mothers.Back then, a child born out of wedlock was a scandal, but a child born to a Catholic mother and a married Protestant father was another scandal entirely.After meeting each other for the first time last October, the siblings journeyed to Kerry, where they laid flowers at their mother#s graveside.It was a journey I never thought I would make with a brother, said Helen.She was our mother and we believe she wanted the best for us. In doing what she did, she sentenced herself to a letime of suffering in silence.As part of their journey together, each has visited the spot where the other was found and they both now have theories on why their parents did what they did.In , Donal Boyle told Helen that he recalled there was a car parked close to the phone box - and while he was inside, this car circled around before driving off. It is a detail that still niggles.There are a few dferent ways of looking at it, said Helen. Until we find out more, we can#t actually say, right, #It was your mum and dad who put you in the phonebox that night#. Was it a friend  Was it a grandparent  Was it an aunt  Friends of my father, friends of my mother Although lockdown has prevented meetings with extended family members on both parents# sides, David had a brief meeting with some of his relatives before Christmas.I met some of our mother#s family in Kerry, he said.I learned that she had a personality very much like Helen#s - she was a dressmaker, like Helen. She was sociable and articulate and very kind.Like his sister, David believes someone helped his mother on the night she left Helen and that their parents may have been influenced by other people when decisions were being made.I think there are people who assisted our parents, he said.I am almost certain the lady who was seen the night that Helen was found was our mother. I also think it was our mother who placed Helen in the telephone box.Whether the gentleman that was in the car was our father, or a family relative of our mother, I don#t know.It may have been that the inidual who went along with our mother that night may have been going along to make sure that Helen was placed in a telephone box to make sure what they had agreed was happening.The siblings believe shame and fear may stop them getting to the full truth.Several themes run through their story, close-knit communities in rural Ireland, the influence of the Church, the attitude of society to unmarried mothers, and the bubbling tensions in the North.There was a lot at stake, said David.If they had been found out, their lives were over. They would have been sent to prison and cast out by their families.As Helen and David spoke via a shared video-call this week, thoughts ed to the almost identical bags each was placed in as babies.The siblings have learned that their father was born in Scotland and moved to Dublin as a baby.Was the red tartan a nod to his heritage  Or is the simpler explanation that their mother wanted someone to make a link between her two children  I think there is a connection with the bag, said David.There was six years between us. Our mother or father, or both of them, had to find the same bag, which was the same colour and the same make. I think someone wanted a connection to be made.The question of how no connection was made until last year is one they have both discussed.We were found in two dferent jurisdictions in the s, said David. There was a huge mistrust between the RUC and gardaí at that time.I would question how much co-operation there was between the two jurisdictions at the time and whether or not there was a concerted effort to link up.To date, the siblings have no knowledge that their parents had any link to the North.Again, they are looking for answers about why David was placed there, on a quiet residential street, under the cover of darkness.Our story didn#t end with the programme, said Helen.It brings us to another chapter, one we will share together as we try to find out the truth.I hope our story will encourage people to let the secrets of the past be free, for their own peace of mind and for those who need answers.

Kerry keeper Shane Ryan managed to claw Paddy Smalls speculative shot from above the bar, before toe-poking to the safety of Stephen OBrien. The Kenmare man offloaded to David Moran, who in turn thumped a long ball down the Cusack Stand sideline. When defender Davy Byrne lost the flight of the ball, Tommy Walsh didnt need a second invitation. Killian Spillane burst purposefully through the middle. Walsh, only on the pitch two minutes, gave him the ball. Dublin had enough bodies to deal with it, but Spillane had other ideas. Fresh and fearless. With one feint of the shoulders, he was onto his left foot before burying to the net. Stephen Cluxton shouldve done better, but the Kerry mans low bolt unleashed a bottled emotion from five years of waiting. googletag.cmd.push In , he was the fulcrum of Jack OConnors attack as Kerry won a first minor All-Ireland in two decades. With - to his name and a natural ability to kick off both feet, he lit up that summers championship. In most other counties, he wouldve been straight into the senior team the following season. This was the year of the senior and double. How can we ever forget Kieran Donaghys retort at Joe Brollys statement of Kerrys demise. His family tradition would suggest that he was born to play for Kerry, but Spillane – son of four-time winner Tom - was going to have to wait. googletag.cmd.push Stephen OBrien, Johnny Buckley, Donnchadh Walsh, Paul Geaney, Donaghy and James ODonoghue held the senior jerseys. Darren OSullivan, Kieran OLeary, Declan OSullivan and Barry John Keane were all on the bench. When the squad was announced for the  Super s game with Donegal, Spillane was listed at number , but started the game. Peter Keanes secret weapon notched three points in a - apiece blockbuster. He had arrived and his All-Ireland final goal announced him as a Kerry star of the future. A marked man. On the Ring of Kerry, you will pass through Templenoe. Apart from the sign, you wont even know youve passed through it until you reach the nearby Kenmare. The clubs pitch, which produced Tom, Mick and Pat Spillane, hugs the bay. They supplied four players to the Kingdom squad for last years All-Ireland final - Gavin Crowley, Tadhg Morley, brothers Adrian and Killian Spillane. Almost a tenth of their , from a club that won an All-Ireland junior title. ANOTHER PATH In years between being a minor winner and Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice handing him a senior league debut, in , Killian played on the Kerry junior team. Jason Foley and Graham OSullivan, mainstays of the current defence, did the same. Conor Cox, now playing with Roscommon, used the junior grade as a step ladder to the next level of his career. It has a ruling that enforces a county to change their entire team after winning it, yet Kerry have still won it five times in a row. Its not the most prestigious title in the world, but its football and a shop window. The fact that Kerry are getting such a pull from the bottom rung, gives them such an advantage. Declan OSullivan hails from Dromoid Pearses. In Tyrone, you have Rock supplying Kieran Gourley when Tyrone were in their pomp. Galway goalkeeper and An Spideal man Maghnus Breatnach has played for the juniors, a grade that helped elevate his clubmate Antaine Oacute Laoiacute to Paacutedraic Joyces attention. Mayos Darren Coen was the same. Derry are nowhere close to getting this type of . In the last  seasons,  players have played league or championship. From John Brennans Ulster final season of  to the present day, none come from junior clubs. Goalkeeper Oran Hartin had two appearances and played junior championship for Limavady, but of the  seasons, they have played at intermediate level for six of them. Of the , only  hail from intermediate clubs. For the purposes of the study, the club is graded on the number of years playing at championship level in the last decade. It ranks Greenlough and Newbridge as senior, with Foreglen at intermediate. Enda Lynnhas represented Derry most during the window. Oisin Duffy, Niall Keenan and Neil Forester are the only intermediate players to exceed  outings, with Marty Donaghy taking his tally to  in the  qualier exit to Longford. In terms of championship action, nobody outside of the senior grade has played more than  times, though Niall Keenan is likely to be the first. A debate for another day is the lack of city players that have made the breakthrough. The total sits at three. Neil Forester and Eoghan Concannon, neither of whom are on Rory Gallaghers senior squad, are two. Ben McCarron is the third. Of around  boys in a year group at St Columbs, I remember Eamonn Burns saying that only around  had the basic skills by the time they entered the gates in first year. Some dont have clubs at all. Until that changes, it is dficult to see the city really giving Derry the support it needs to progress as a county. And there are people promoting Gaelic games in the city, who are as passionate as anywhere  in Ireland. There just arent enough. When I think of the joy in the face of Neil Forester after winning games with Derry minors and the sheer dejection after Castledawson beat Steelstown in the  intermediate final. Real emotion. If only there were more like him to drive the GAA message in the city. Back to the topic in question, getting players from minor to senior. The Derry conundrum. Rather than going around in circles, why not enter a team in the All-Ireland junior championship  Since there are no Ulster teams involved, it would take travel and money. And it would take time. Derry have been at the top of the charts in recent years, in terms of funding from Croke Park. Maybe it is time to filter some of that cash into the area that is failing most and leave underageto clubs and schools, who are continually churning out players. From chatting to a few people from non senior clubs, there could be an appetite for it. But it would need to be done properly. Not a half-arsed job. As a starting point, draw up a football development committee. Call a meeting, for all the captains and chairmen of Derrys intermediate and junior clubs and put out the feelers. Ask the hard questions. Why have players been overlooked  Leave it open to players who either have not made the U , or are too old for it. Take a look at the club manager circuit and approach someone to take it on. It wouldnt take up that much time, as players need to have access to their club. They have the first draw on the players after all. Essentially, it is a development squad for the seniors. What would it have not done for a Lee Moore, who was one of the best county minors in Ireland for two seasons  He wasnt ready to displace Paddy Bradley. Who was, Lee had all the qualities to have been his successor. A Paudie ONeill needs his class properly massaged into a county senior player. It is a long shot and it will be hard to sell. There will be plenty of obstacles. But isnt there always, in all walks of le. If it was easy, it would have been done already. In the last ten years, Neil Forester, Niall Keenan, Oisin Duffy, Eoghan Concannon, Marty Donaghy and Bliain Gormley are the six intermediate players, from the  who have worn an Oakleaf championship jersey, to have played in the championship for Derry from outside the senior ranks. Its not enough. Kerrys Shane Ryan and Killian Spillane dont play for senior clubs. They were county minors in , and five years later – in their senior debut season – they were on the front line, battling for Sam. ALSO READ - Be careful what you wish for. More...

Kerry keeper Shane Ryan managed to claw Paddy Smalls speculative shot from above the bar, before toe-poking to the safety of Stephen OBrien. The Kenmare man offloaded to David Moran, who in turn thumped a long ball down the Cusack Stand sideline. When defender Davy Byrne lost the flight of the ball, Tommy Walsh didnt need a second invitation. Killian Spillane burst purposefully through the middle. Walsh, only on the pitch two minutes, gave him the ball. Dublin had enough bodies to deal with it, but Spillane had other ideas. Fresh and fearless. With one feint of the shoulders, he was onto his left foot before burying to the net. Stephen Cluxton shouldve done better, but the Kerry mans low bolt unleashed a bottled emotion from five years of waiting. googletag.cmd.push In , he was the fulcrum of Jack OConnors attack as Kerry won a first minor All-Ireland in two decades. With - to his name and a natural ability to kick off both feet, he lit up that summers championship. In most other counties, he wouldve been straight into the senior team the following season. This was the year of the senior and double. How can we ever forget Kieran Donaghys retort at Joe Brollys statement of Kerrys demise. His family tradition would suggest that he was born to play for Kerry, but Spillane – son of four-time winner Tom - was going to have to wait. googletag.cmd.push Stephen OBrien, Johnny Buckley, Donnchadh Walsh, Paul Geaney, Donaghy and James ODonoghue held the senior jerseys. Darren OSullivan, Kieran OLeary, Declan OSullivan and Barry John Keane were all on the bench. When the squad was announced for the  Super s game with Donegal, Spillane was listed at number , but started the game. Peter Keanes secret weapon notched three points in a - apiece blockbuster. He had arrived and his All-Ireland final goal announced him as a Kerry star of the future. A marked man. On the Ring of Kerry, you will pass through Templenoe. Apart from the sign, you wont even know youve passed through it until you reach the nearby Kenmare. The clubs pitch, which produced Tom, Mick and Pat Spillane, hugs the bay. They supplied four players to the Kingdom squad for last years All-Ireland final - Gavin Crowley, Tadhg Morley, brothers Adrian and Killian Spillane. Almost a tenth of their , from a club that won an All-Ireland junior title. ANOTHER PATH In years between being a minor winner and Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice handing him a senior league debut, in , Killian played on the Kerry junior team. Jason Foley and Graham OSullivan, mainstays of the current defence, did the same. Conor Cox, now playing with Roscommon, used the junior grade as a step ladder to the next level of his career. It has a ruling that enforces a county to change their entire team after winning it, yet Kerry have still won it five times in a row. Its not the most prestigious title in the world, but its football and a shop window. The fact that Kerry are getting such a pull from the bottom rung, gives them such an advantage. Declan OSullivan hails from Dromoid Pearses. In Tyrone, you have Rock supplying Kieran Gourley when Tyrone were in their pomp. Galway goalkeeper and An Spideal man Maghnus Breatnach has played for the juniors, a grade that helped elevate his clubmate Antaine Oacute Laoiacute to Paacutedraic Joyces attention. Mayos Darren Coen was the same. Derry are nowhere close to getting this type of . In the last  seasons,  players have played league or championship. From John Brennans Ulster final season of  to the present day, none come from junior clubs. Goalkeeper Oran Hartin had two appearances and played junior championship for Limavady, but of the  seasons, they have played at intermediate level for six of them. Of the , only  hail from intermediate clubs. For the purposes of the study, the club is graded on the number of years playing at championship level in the last decade. It ranks Greenlough and Newbridge as senior, with Foreglen at intermediate. Enda Lynnhas represented Derry most during the window. Oisin Duffy, Niall Keenan and Neil Forester are the only intermediate players to exceed  outings, with Marty Donaghy taking his tally to  in the  qualier exit to Longford. In terms of championship action, nobody outside of the senior grade has played more than  times, though Niall Keenan is likely to be the first. A debate for another day is the lack of city players that have made the breakthrough. The total sits at three. Neil Forester and Eoghan Concannon, neither of whom are on Rory Gallaghers senior squad, are two. Ben McCarron is the third. Of around  boys in a year group at St Columbs, I remember Eamonn Burns saying that only around  had the basic skills by the time they entered the gates in first year. Some dont have clubs at all.

The Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, Rt RevAndrew Forster, joined scores of parishioners from the Parish of St Augustine’s and further afield for the service at Bishop Street car park in the city centre on Sunday morning to mark Pentecost Day. The service,which took place in glorious sunshine,was led by the Rector of St Augustines - ‘The Wee Church on the Walls’ -Rev Nigel Cairns. The car park adjoins St Augustine’s Parish Hall and is opposite the city’s courthouse. A team of volunteers, dressed in ‘high-vis’ vests and PPE gear, oversaw a one-way, ‘car ferry’ type system, that meant cars were directed in one entrance and out bya dferent route after the service. googletag.cmd.push Social-distancing guidelines required all those present to remain in their cars during worship, and parish volunteers ensured that none of the worshippers fell victim to the soaring temperature. Bishop Andrew, who preached the sermon,welcomed the congregation to what he called his ‘back garden’ . He said: St Augustine’s was known as ‘the Wee Church on the Walls’. Today, we’re the wee church without walls. I always think about St Augustine’s as the wee Church with a big heart and today we’re showing our big heart because we’re together, worshipping God on this Pentecost Sunday. googletag.cmd.push “This is definitely a first for me,” the Bishop said, “and I would imagine it’s a first for many of you as well, but God is here and we worship him in spirit and in truth.” Rev Cairns echoed Bishop Forster’s welcome to the first ‘Drive-through Church’ in the inner city, and thanked all those who had helped make the service possible. He said the St Augustine’s parishioners would be gathering for worship in the same location again next Sunday.

The plan was to bring entertainment to the war weary inhabitants of the town.This meeting would lead to the formation of St Patrickrsquos Operatic and Pantomime Society and their first production was Phyllis, the Farmerrsquos Daughter mdash a title that has dated somewhat.The public responded by volunteering as actors, stage hands, working with costumes and music.Principals and chorus rehearsed separately. Only one week before opening night did they merge, coming together for the first time on the stage of St Patrickrsquos Hall.It was advertised as lsquoA Feast of Music, Song and Dancersquo boasting  voices. Rehearsal took place in the McLean home, the cast rehearsed upstairs, while machinists and costumiers worked downstairs.Phyllis, the Farmerrsquos Daughter was performed on Sunday, May , and Monday, May , .It proved successful enough to be followed in  by other productions such as Tangles, The Enchanted Rose and Quest of Olwen.The performances, in the absence of film footage and photographs, appear to be lost in the haze of time.Tangles, described as a grand musical comedy, was performed in St Patrickrsquos Hall on Monday, June , the night before the Normandy Landings. The performance was in aid of the Down County Infirmary.The programme included cast and production notes. The actors, credited as lsquoMortalsrsquo included Michael Tomelty as Lollipop, Sally King as Princess Pansy, Lillian Lundy as Dame Mouldy, Leslie Rice as Lord Humbug and Master Michael Rea as the Inn Keeperrsquos Son. lsquoImmortalsrsquo included Peggy Halloran as Titania, Maura Blaney as Nona and Mary Gilmore as lsquoCinderellarsquo.Also included was an array of guardsmen, a chorus of fairies, village chorus, court dancers, innkeeper chorus, fairy partners, bunnies and a chorus of gnomes, who included Maureen Dorrian, Annie Murphy and June Doyle. In all, the cast numbered .The scenic artist was Mr James Maguire and the costume designer was Mrs OrsquoKelly. In charge of actors make-up were Mrs Maguire, Kathleen Branf and Mrs Gilmore.But, what was the story  With appearances from gnomes and Cinderella it may have had a little to do with fairyland.Is there anyone out there who remembers  At this distance, it is just a forgotten show, one of many that enter-tained people at a most dficult time in history.Around Lecale and where, there were a number of amateur dramatic companies, many more than today, who performed many shows. Here are but a sample.Old King Cole by May King, with nine scenes and a chorus of , was a three-hour show, staged in St Patrickrsquos Hall, Downpatrick, at pm on Sunday, February , .Reserved tickets were on sale from Mr Breen, Mr Fox and Mr Doris.Ballykilbeg Dramatic Society gave the public a production of Paul Twyning by George Shiels on Sunday, March , and Tuesday, March , , with a repeat performance in St Patrickrsquos Hall, Downpatrick, the following Sunday.Kilclief Parish Amateur Dramatic Club staged Shielsrsquo new comedy, The Fort Field, in St Malachyrsquos Hall in the village on Sunday, May , . They also performed it in the Stella Maris Hall in Strangford the following Friday.Killyleagh Dramatic Society presented St John Ervinersquos lsquoBoydrsquos Shop at the Belfast Dramatic Festival during the first week of September , having staged it during the late summer of that year in Strangford.On the night of Sunday, November , , you could treat yourself to Stars over Ballynoe, an all-star iety concert in St Patrickrsquos Parochial Hall, Ballynoe, with Alister Dick, the famous Irish tenor, Alfie Donnelly, Irelandrsquos funniest comedian, the Legamaddy Dancers and the Portaferry Hawaiian Band.

Hopefully, therersquos more to come, he said.Joersquos latest work is QUINN - No Place to Hide, a standalone follow-up to a successful launch of the first in the series. The title is dedicated to his great grandfather, Sam Quinn, a man Joe admired for the way in which he dealt with the harshness of le in Downpatrick at the turn of the twentieth century.ldquoHe worked -hour shts, six days a week, as a yard foreman at the Rearsquos bottling plant in Market Street, Downpatrick. It was backbreaking work for which he earned a pittance to feed a large family. He never complained, never took a holiday, and never ventured outside the confines of the town. He lived through two world wars, the creation of the Irish Republic, and countless other momentous times, yet he kept his head down and simply got on with his own le.Joe is quick to point out that the character in his latest book is nothing like his ancestor. ldquoAll Irsquove taken is his name. My version of Quinn is that of an international assassin who leaves Downpatrick to join the Irish Rangers and later becomes a gun for hire in America. Talk about two dferent worlds! Perhaps though, therersquos a bit of parallel in that I transferred old Sam Quinnrsquos stoicism and relentless nature into a make-believe cut-out who lives his le by those very ideals.With a -year background in journalism, it was hardly surprising that Joe wanted to keep writing when he switched careers in  to head up Down Business Centre, a support enterprise agency to help promote start-up businesses.He said: ldquoI loved the interaction with local entrepreneurs, but the writing bug doesnrsquot go away. I had always an idea for a book and couldnrsquot stop scratching the itch. After a few years, I decided to put it into action.That first book mdash SOMEONE HAS TO PAY mdash was a product of the Northern Ireland Troubles. It is set in the unlikely surroundings of Bishopscourt, a former RAF base just outside Downpatrick, and features a British government elite squad assembled under the relative anonymity of the old complex for the purposes of waging a final shoot-to-kill war against the IRA.Joersquos own assessment of the story brings a wry smile. ldquoItrsquos a far-fetched idea, isnrsquot it  It couldnrsquot have happened, could it  Thatrsquos the essence of the storyteller and I guess itrsquos why I love doing it.A recurring theme in Joersquos books is that he likes toin a mention of his hometown whenever possible. Yoursquoll find Downpatrick cropping up a lot in background narratives, or as the setting for a few hair-raising episodes that attempt to weave their way into the history and fabric of the area.ldquoItrsquos just something I like to do. Irsquom a Downpatrick man and I have the urge to shout about it when the chance arises. Wersquove a lot going for us in this area and it can only do good to let the world know wersquore here.One of his other books SPENT FORCE, which was a crime thriller set in the West of Ireland and featured a fading Garda detective, attracted praise from two signicant sources. One was Ken Bruen, the international bestselling author of the Jack Taylor Irish crime series, who wrote: ldquoSometimes a book comes along that you instantly know......damn, I am now going to have to read this all over again for the sheer joy of the narrative. It means that I will have to swear off other books for a time as very few can provide the utter joy and delight of Joe McCoubreyrsquos superb novel.Another unexpected source was a serving Garda sergeant who posted a glowing review on the Amazon . ldquoA top-class novel which deserves high praise. I am from Irish law enforcement and this novel is as close to a real-le investigation as you can get. Gripping from start to finish, totally believable characters, strong storyline, Highly Recommended.Joe admits he was floored by the feedback. ldquoOn the one hand there was an endorsement by perhaps Irelandrsquos foremost crime thriller author, while on the other there was vindication from a policeman that the research and effort to get things right had paid off. Itrsquos what any author craves, and itrsquos what makes you want to get back over the keyboard and start into the next adventure.That next adventure is taking Joe back to the West of Ireland to team up again with his favourite Garda detective. The sequel is provisionally titled FORCE OF NATURE which delves into the murky world of a serial killer. Not surprisingly, Downpatrick features heavily again.ldquoYes, the killerrsquos first three victims are young girls from Downpatrick. The story will move from here to Westport and back again. Irsquom still not sure how it will end, and thatrsquos as much an appeal to me as it is to the reader.Joe explains that hersquos not a dedicated story plotter. ldquoI use a broad brush. I get an idea and just run with it. I donrsquot like to be confined to structure from start to finish, with the result that Irsquom not quite sure where Irsquom going from one chapter to another. I think of it as being spontaneous, which means I usually go off on tangents that keeps things fresh and moving along. Itrsquos a seat-of-the-pants alternative to being a plotter.Joe publishes all his books under his own publishing house, Inishfree Communications, which also offers support to local writers. To date, he has helped eight others to complete their author journey ndash between them they have published more than  titles. He provides proofing, formatting, and design services, including suggestions on the most effective covers for inidual books.ldquoItrsquos a big part of what I do these days, says Joe. ldquoThere are lots of budding writers and independent authors out there who just need a bit of extra help and encouragement to bring their work in front of the masses. I get as much of a kick out of seeing these books go on sale as I do from my own works.Joe McCoubreyrsquos books are available as paperbacks or eBooks on the Amazon and Barnes  Noble s..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Call for hedge removal after near miss  ","story":"AN overgrown hedge close to a BT exchange in Killyleagh is being blamed for a near miss involving a pedestrian and a bus last week.A woman who was forced to step on to the main road to avoid the hedge was almost struck by the vehicle as it passed, leaving both her and the driver shaken.BT has confirmed that it plans to cut the hedge this week, but local councillor Billy Walker said the telecoms giant must go further and remove it completely.He said there was a wall behind the hedge, suggesting that once the hedge is removed, BT would only have to build a small fence on top of it to secure its base.ldquoThe overgrown hedge has been an issue for many years and there have been countless near misses involving people who have had to step off the footpath to pass, including mums with prams. What happened last Friday is the final straw as far as I am concerned, declared Cllr Walker.ldquoThe only sensible solution is to remove the hedge in its entirety. To do so would not cost a lot of money, but would save lives as at this time of year as people would not have to walk on a busy main road to pass.Cllr Walker says he has raised the issue with the telecoms company over the years, but was told the hedge could not be cut back as it was the nesting season.ldquoMy biggest fear has always been that someone could end up getting killed or seriously injured at this part of Killyleagh. While I am thankful the woman who stepped off the footpath last Friday was not seriously injured, this must be the last incident of this kind, said Cllr Walker.ldquoI am appealing to BT to do the decent thing and finally remove the hedge.

Some people have looked at Everest and thought climbing it is necessary. Others call those people crazy.Everesting is described as ldquofiendishly simple, yet brutally hard. Ride hill repeats on any hill anywhere in the world mdash or on Zwt, the virtual cycling simulator mdash in a single activity until you climb the equivalent height of Mount Everest.The concept was created by Hells , who also control the induction into the Everesting Hall of Fame. Website Everesting.cc contains the rules to follow.Well, call me crazy, but I did it. No, I didnrsquot fly to Nepal and climb the actual mountain. Irsquom not a former pro athlete or extraordinarily gted human, nor am I an adventure adrenaline junkie looking for a fix. Irsquom just a  something mdash  to be precise mdash son of God who has a family, a job, a dog, a bicycle, and I landed myself in the Everesting Hall of Fame. And you can too.I decided to use the challenge to help raise funds for mental health organisations Aware and Ballynahinch Counselling Service, or The Hub, as itrsquos known locally. My initial target was pound but I was astounded and humbled by the generosity of people. In the end donations totalled pound,.I chose to start at am so I could have family support at the finish. Despite the early start I was joined by my we, Jennie, and through the day she was a great support, bringing me fresh drinks and relaying messages of support.I turned on my favourite music playlist and hit the hill with a measured effort that I thought I could sustain for hours. I planned a bidon of sports drink for each ascent, as well as -g carbs per hour. Real foods early in the ride and gels and sugary drinks for later in the ride.The first three or four ascents felt strangely comfortable, averaging  minutes up each time. I was almost an hour ahead of my estimated -hour schedule by midday. I later noticed some friends,, who were tracking my progress, were saying how strong I was riding and hoped that I wouldnrsquot pay for it later.They were right! Ascents six and seven were so tough, even to the point where I felt physically ill, and my times were now over  minutes per climb.vEveresters add the tag lsquovEverestingrsquo to their Zwt profile name which means anyone on the course that sees it knows you are vEveresting and many will ride with you, congratulate you, give you a thumbs up, or just encourage you to keep going.These wonderful sherpas made it a much more enjoyable experience, especially during the sixth and seventh ascents when it was dficult to want to keep riding and my butt was telling me that I was crazy to push on.Despite wanting to reach the finish as soon as possible, I had to listen to my body, and so I stopped for some food and a bit of a rest. Another quick shower, kit change and application of chamois cream, and I was ready to continue.I was joined online this time by good friends Nathan Mullan and Stephen Hanna, both from Dromara Cycling Club, and Sam Carmichael and Nigel Bradley, from my old club, Northwest CC. Seeing them there gave me a real boost and that combined with knowing I had the end in sight really spurred me on to the finish.The final  metres of climbing were the best - I was getting messages of encouragement from Zwters from places as far away as Germany, USA and Colombia. I finished shortly after pm, over  hours after I first leapt into the saddle and boy did I sleep well that night.So to finish, Irsquod like to say a huge thanks to everyone for their support, to those who donated in such hard times mdash Irsquom so grateful and Irsquom hopeful we will make le that little bit easier for others.I havenrsquot put any thought into the next challenge mdash on Sunday I said never again mdash but the beauty of cycling is therersquos always the next time.

Thatrsquos something our whole extended family embraces.ldquoItrsquos going to be bittersweet but we are happy for Mary and the lovely couple who are adopting her. Itrsquos good to know that she will be going to her forever home and will have a lovely little le. Thatrsquos always the ultimate aim for a child, particularly a younger child.ldquoHowever, one of the challenges is trying to teach her about adoption. How do you teach a three year-old that she will be leaving us and going to a forever family  We had to be creative and came up with the idea about the Christmas elf. Like many houses, we had Bauble the elf at Christmas, who was then lsquoadoptedrsquo by Mary and now lives with us all year round and is part of our family. We even made an adoption certicate to show her it was real.ldquoWhile Covid- has put a hold on this for now, we still have to prepare both Mary and ourselves, as it will be hard to say goodbye. But, as our daughter keeps saying, itrsquos part of foster care and what is right for Mary.ldquoEveryone has been writing their goodbye letters to her. We have prepared a book about her time with us and videos so that she wonrsquot have any gaps when shersquos looking back on her le.The Dicksons have been fostering since  and have looked after eight children so far, ranging in age from one to eight. They do respite fostering ndash temporary childcare for another fosterer or family ndash and short-term foster care.Itrsquos something that the couple have wanted to do for a long time.ldquoI wanted to foster for as long as in my early twenties and my husband felt the same, said  year-old Tanya. ldquoWe both came from family backgrounds where close relatives were in the caring professions.ldquoWe were very united in knowing that we would foster one day, even from the day we were married. However, when our daughter Hannah came along, we wanted her to be part of it, obviously, and to wait until the time that we were sure she understood the impact of it.ldquoWe waited until she was about  before we contacted the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust. Thatrsquos where our journey started, and we havenrsquot looked back once. The Trust has been with us every step of the way. The only regret we have had about fostering is not doing it sooner.The Dicksons have also been supported by their nearest and dearest in doing something that many other people consider doing.ldquoWe were lucky that our families were always on board with us regarding our fostering, Tanya said. Our employers have been amazing, our church family and even the village family of Crossgar. Everyone has really embraced our fostering journey.After making contact with the Trust Tanya, who works at Kilmood Early Years Playgroup, said that after a period of assessment and training they began to foster six months later.ldquoI think the assessment can put people off, but I believe itrsquos an invaluable tool as you come out of it knowing yourself better, she explained. You know your own personal qualities better and your skill base.ldquoItrsquos also essential as it helps the Trust match children with dferent needs with dferent foster carers. The only thing we stipulated is that any child we cared for would be at least two years younger than Hannah as we wanted her to be the eldest child in the house.Hannah, who is a student of Saintfield High School, has been integral to the couplersquos success as foster parents and has relished her role as lsquobig sisterrsquo.Mrs Dickson said: ldquoHannah has been so great with the children. With Hannah maturing, she is showing her experience of fostering in a very positive and beautul way by showing empathy to others.ldquoThatrsquos something she would never have experienced had we not fostered and she feels more grateful for her family le. She wants to be a nurse and I can see that great caring spirit being fostered in her care of Mary. Itrsquos been so rewarding and has changed us completely for the better.Unlike many first-time parents, Tanya said foster parents always have help and support available.She said: ldquoEvery child that comes through our door is dferent and you adapt accordingly for whatever that child needs. We have the support of a link worker, who has had a lot of training. Yoursquore never on your own.ldquoWe have learnt to take things at a childrsquos pace. Some children who have been looked after before are used to being more independent and self-sufficient. You have to walk a fine line at the beginning with each child to know what they want you to do for them.The Dicksons hope to continue fostering for as long as possible and to do their best for any child that comes their way.ldquoCaring for a toddler has kept us young. You are on the ball from the crack of dawn until bedtime. I would like to think we could continue fostering for as long as we want as therersquos no age limit to fostering, she added.If you are interested in becoming a foster carer, like Tanya, or just want to find out more about what is involved, visit the HSC Northern Ireland Adoption and Foster Care website or call    to find out more.* Maryrsquos name has been changed to protect her identity..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Dean pops the question at open air gig  ","story":"A KILMORE man enlisted the help of local musician Eddie Booth when he got down on one knee to propose to his girlfriend recently.Dean Campbelland his girlfriend of ten years Laura Walters, have been big fans of Eddiersquos lsquoLive at the Lamplightrsquo gigs which he performs from his garden in Kilmore each Saturday night during the Covid- lockdown.However, unbeknown to Laura, who is a care worker for the NHS, Saturday, May , was about to become the most memorable of them all.Dean, who works for a local quarry company, says keeping the proposal a secret from Laura was the hardest thing he ever had to do.ldquoI had spoken with Laurarsquos parents, who live in England, to let them know what I was planning and arranged for them to be tuning into Eddiersquos gig via Zoom, he said.While Laura, who is also , was excited about seeing her family, she remained oblivious to the fact Eddie, was in on the delightful conspiracy.ldquoTherersquos just so much sad news around at the moment, I thought it would be a wee morale boost for the community to pop the question, so I approached Eddie to ask for his help.

Republicans are already planning a memorial on council property in Castlewellan and it is believed that loyalists in Ballynahinch may erect a memorial to dead UVF terrorists on council land at Langley Road.KILLYLEAGH ndash A new community forum, to represent the interests of a wide range of groups in the Killyleagh area, is to be set up.The umbrella organisation will represent what has been described as the ldquoimpressive level of community activity in the area.The idea to create the new group was floated at last weekrsquos annual meeting of the Killyleagh, Shrigley and District Town Committee by secretary Peter Bryson.He said the new group is vital to enable better communication and planning and help with the compilation of joint funding applications to a range of funders.He said the creation of the new group could provide the perfect  on which to develop partnerships of shared interest in the Killyleagh area.SAINTFIELD mdash As the controversy over the dangers of mobile telephone equipment continues, Saintfield residents have found themselves at the centre of the most recent debate.Parents and councillors met in the local library last week to discuss their fears of two telecommunications masts at Comber Road, which they believe are casting a shadow over the local high school.The public meeting was called by mother-of-three Laura Bill in the wake of the independent Stewart report which advises parents not to allow their children to use mobile phones, and pointed to children as being most likely to be affected by possible health risks.Leukaemia is one illness which reports have suggested could be caused, or aggravated by, radiation from mobile phone masts.One woman told Thursdayrsquos meeting that a pocket of seven children under  years of age suffer from childhood leukaemia in the Saintfield area, leading to parental fears that this could be aggravated by the existence of the masts.BALLYGOWAN mdash A shooting incident in Ballygowan during the early hours of Monday is being linked to a paramilitary feud.The house at Comber Road was sprayed with automatic gunfire by four men who smashed a number of windows.

Indeed, the safety of those working in the sector, as well as that of the wider public, will be paramount in all of this.Ms Rogan said that the reopening of tourist accommodation will depend on the rate of transmission, appealing to people to ensure this can go ahead as planned by continuing to follow social distancing guidelines.She added: ldquoIf we continue to work together, to follow the guidelines and stay safe and save lives then we can get our tourism economy open for business again.Cllr Curran said he was pleased that a major part of the tourism sector was scheduled to reopen and echoed calls for people to continue following public health advice, suggesting aldquochallenging world awaits all aspects of business in the months and years ahead.ldquoTourism is the districtrsquos number one product and, prior to the pandemic, generated hundreds of thousands of pounds for the local economy, helping sustain thousands of jobs, he continued.ldquoClearly, the safety of staff and the public is paramount moving forward and I have every confidence that those who run our hotels, guesthouses, caravan parks and other tourist accommodation will have this at the top of their agenda.Cllr Curran said he concurred with the economy ministerrsquos contention that enabling accommodation businesses to generate essential revenue will help to protect iniduals and livelihoods which support families and communities across Northern Ireland.He said hoteliers and tourist accommodation providers will be seeking clarity of exactly what services they will be able to offer, so that they can plan for reopening with confidence.Cllr Curran recently called for the umbrella group that represents Northern Irelandrsquos  councils to have a role in helping the tourism industry recover from

have changed signicantly when the crisis ends, but I believe there are opportunities to build for the future.ldquoSouth Down and the wider Lecale area relies heavily upon tourism and the sector must

redevelopment of a major town centre site in Downpatrick were discussed at a key meeting yesterday.A steering group overseeing the redevelopment of the former Irish Street police station, a number of adjacent empty buildings and a Newry, Mourne and Down Council-owned car park met to discuss a new brochure which has been designed for the near two acre site.While it was suggested that the coronavirus pandemic is likely to delay the redevelopment of the huge site, traders and politicians are keen to see work starting on the eagerly-awaited economic regeneration of this historic part of the town.The local council and the Department for Communities are spearheading an ambitious regeneration project with the new brochure mdash understood to be still in draft form ndash designed to provide potential developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquospotential and secure expressions of interest.A number of Irish Street businesses have already invested in upgrading their respective shop fronts while the former police base was recently given a fresh coat of paint as part of a revitalisation scheme.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the pubic virtually.Described as a strategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential.While the imposing former police station enjoys protected status and cannot be razed to the ground, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come with an imaginative plan for the building.It has been identied as a development opportunity site in the Down Area Plan, with the area to the front included in Downpatrickrsquos conservation area.While it has been suggested that housing could form part of any redevelopment proposal, the building has been touted as a potential base for offices.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.They are keen to retain Irish Streetrsquos uniqueness where residents and traders live and work alongside each other and ensure that there is adequate parking. There have already been suggestions that an underground parking facility at the current Irish Street car park would allow retail units to be built on top.Work was recently completed on a protracted public realm scheme in Irish Street and it is hoped that the redevelopment of the former police base will complement this project, which resulted in the provision of new granite paving, street furniture and lighting.Downpatrick councillors are keen to see the redevelopment proposal increase the number of shoppers to the town to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the townrsquos economy for many years.It is also hoped to regenerate the town centrersquos night time economy with politicians eager for the Irish Street scheme to create a number of much-needed new jobs.Earlier this year, a number of Downpatrick councillors were given the opportunity to view the inside of the former police base and the expansive grounds to the rear.Local council officials say they are committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site and had been planning to meet with them to discuss the way forward prior to the coronavirus pandemic.In addition, the local authority aims to work alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have previously expressed an interest in the Irish Street location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre. However, it remains to be seenthat interest remains given the current economic climate.Downpatrick councillors say that they recognise the Irish Street regeneration project provides an opportunity to regenerate the town centre and provide a boost for existing businesses and hope that the project can be progressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Minister asked to give assurances on bypass  ","story":"STORMONT roads minister Nichola Mallon has been asked to make it clear that delivering Ballynahinchrsquos multi-million pound bypass remains one of her key priorities.The appeal has been issued by South Down MP Chris Hazzard mdash a former minister at the Department of Infrastructure mdash who is keen to see work starting on the poundm project.When he was at the helm of the Stormont department, Mr Hazzard signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December .Since then, there has been major progress to deliver the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads, with work already completed on a major archaeological investigation along parts of the route.Work was due to complete on the schemersquos economic appraisal before the end of last year, with roads engineers confirming recently that in order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents was ongoing to ldquominimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.The bypass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with major new roundabouts proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Mr Hazzard said while the coronavirus pandemic has consumed much time for all government departments, he does want to diminish Ms Mallonrsquos role in working constructively with her executive colleagues in mitigating the worst effects of the global emergency.But he said since that taking over the reins at the roads department five months ago, the minister has issued statements on electric bikes and hydrogen buses and what he described as ldquoplenty of positive soundings on other capital projects, but there hasnrsquot been a single word on the long overdue Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThis is a relatively low-cost, yet strategic infrastructure scheme that is shovel ready. Yet it hasnrsquot featured in any of the ministerrsquos public commentary on her departmentrsquos priorities for the time ahead since taking office in January, said Mr Hazzard.ldquoIt is unsurprising then that local businesses and commuters are beginning to question the infrastructure ministerrsquos commitment to deliver this scheme.The MP says he has once again asked Ms Mallon to definitively set out that the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for her department and set out a timeline for commencing construction.He added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the successful delivery of this project will be a vital step in improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our local community in these dficult times.In a letter to Ms Mallon, the South Down MP said the bypass scheme is at an advanced stage and is as close to ldquoshovel ready as any other project in the government departmentrsquorsquos capital programme.He has asked the ministerthe Ballynahinch scheme remains a ldquopriority capital project, what stage is it currently at and when will construction work be signed off Responding to Mr Hazzard, a spokesman for the roads minister said that while she is currently faced with ldquoserious and challenging budget constraints, she has already stated that she is committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for communities and improve lives across the North.ldquoShe very much recognises that many in the local community support the provision of a bypass in Ballynahinch, the spokesman continued.ldquoIn finalising budget decisions, the minister is focused on addressing the need to fund essential infrastructure work, promoting a green recovery and getting other strategic projects underway.The spokesman said that in particular, Ms Mallon is considering her long term priorities for strategic road improvement schemes and how they might facilitate complementary improvements to promote sustainable travel choices, connecting people and communities, creating thriving and liveable places that enhance opportunities and our economy.The spokesman added: ldquoThe minister understands the frustration among the people of South Down at the failure of previous administrations to deliver important projects.ldquoShe has already set out her ambition to address regional imbalance with the delivery of projects and hopes elected representatives from across all parties and across the Executive will support her in securing the money to deliver strategic projects which improve both our economy and the wellbeing of our local communities in South Down and across the North in these dficult times..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"National Trust sites reopen  ","story":"A NUMBER of local National Trust properties reopen from today.The National Trust has confirmed that Saintfieldrsquos stunning Rowallane Garden and Castle Ward and Mount Stewart mdash both on the shores of Strangford Lough mdash will be welcoming visitors after being closed for a number of weeks as part of the coronavirus lockdown restrictions.In total,  properties are reopening across the province, with Trust officials confirming that advance bookings will be required in order to limit numbers and maintain public safety.

Please try again later.Submitting...It seems obvious, but how many of us really know when we’re reaching the end of our contracts The rules for most business sectors state that you should be notied in advance of a contract renewing. For things like insurance where the regulations are strict, you should be notied in writing a month in advance. However, some sectors just send an email or even *shocked face* a text! I don’t think that’s fair or transparent, but given the current situation, its up to you to turn detective to beat the sneaky renewals.Why not set up a calendar reminder a month before the renewal date so you know you’ve got time to shop around ... the firm isn’t providing the service you signed up for.Nothing lasts forever and over the course of a year, the service that businesses offer you will change too.If you believe that the business you signed a contract with isn’t providing the key things that you wanted from it, that can often be grounds to break the contract early. However, the rules are not definitive in most sectors, so you’ll have to put your case to the business in detailyou want to avoid an exit fee.... the relationship has broken down ‘Breaking up is never easy, but I have to go...’ sang Swedish megastars and tragic relationship experts, ABBA. Sometimes relationships with businesses break down and you shouldn’t have to be tied to them by a contractthey’ve behaved badly.As with any relationship, it pays to be honest with yourself about where the blame lies. If a business has treated you badly and refuses to listen, then make a complaint and take it to an ombudsman or alternative dispute resolution scheme need be. Make sure that you specy in your complaint that you want to move on without charge. Resolver can help you make a complaint – or even pass on your comments – to a business for free....you’ve moved and the service isn’t available.Sometimes businesses aren’t very good at logic. One of the big areas of complaint I’ve seen involves people who move to other parts of the UK where a service isn’t available or isn’t much cop. This is most common when it comes to broadband, cable or mobile phone services.The fact of the matter is,your service isn’t available in your new home you shouldn’t have to pay an exit fee. Yet some firms are still digging their heels in over this. Don’t take no for an answer. Be polite but firm and ask the business to waive chargesyou can’t get the service – and go to the free ombudsman servicethey don’t listen....the firm changes its TC’s and you’ll be paying more moneyMany contracts allow businesses to change their terms mid-way through. Butthe change is ‘signicant’ and – more importantly – you’ll be paying more money you should be given the opportunity to get out of the contract without charge. However, you’ll be given a window of opportunity to do this andyou don’t respond in time, you’ll often be chargedyou realise late and try to leave.Meanwhile, remember pandemic-related problems. Be realistic about some problems posed by COVID . There may be a shortage of engineers and contracts to install services, for example.

We will need the help of both the UK government and the EU to make this work, and they will need to help us work through these issues over the coming weeks and months.“Basically the simpler the processes while maintaining biosecurity, promoting public health and complying with the law, the more likely we will be able to succeed in our aim of reducing trade friction.”Dr McMahon said % of UK food imports are from the EU and % of the retail food supply to Northern Ireland comes from Great Britain, adding “to put it bluntly, we all need to make this work”.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Writing in the FT this week about the possibility of a severe recession becoming a depression, former World Bank president Robert Zoellick recalled the warning of the s: “The Depression caused more than economic pain. It metastasised to a loss of faith in democracies, the triumph of ideologies of hate, a turn to demagogues, a breakdown of international trade and finance and, ultimately, the second world war.”With much of the world seething with anger, stoked dangerously by our increasing reliance on mass communication technology the implications of which we still do not fully comprehend, with a rise of nationalistic populism, and a widespread sense on both left and right that for years the old economic order has been breaking down, that is a sobering historic reminder.With Northern Ireland’s long and bloody history of tribal ision, and with heightened constitutional dispute in recent years ahead of the looming centenary commemorations, there are obvious dangersthe upheaval now upon us cannot be managed in a way which both unionists and nationalists believe to be fair.Northern Ireland’s large public sector will only partially cushion the inevitable mass unemployment when the government’s furlough scheme stops paying % of the salaries for jobs which in many cases will no longer exist.The UK economy could shrink by betweena quarter and a third over the second quarter of this year, according to theInstitute for Fiscal Studies, but in a way which exacerbates existing inequality, hitting the poorest most viciously, as well as disproportionatelyhurting women and the young.That economic emergency will only be one of multiple crises which the Executive will face over the coming months. Having been chaotically ided in the early weeks of the pandemic, the Executive has – at least outwardly – come together in the last month. But that unity has been bought at the expense of delaying crucial dficult decisions over how and when lockdown will end. That most pressing question is just the start of a period in whichscores of major decisions will have to be taken about how to reshape NorthernIreland’s economy and multiple areas of society.In that is opportunity as well as threat – but also the potential for Stormont’s sluggish decision-making and mutual vetoes to delay the decisions which could helpbring some good out of this period of death and disruption.Through the increased public expenditure in England to respond to the crisis, the Executive has already seen signicant new income. Much of that has just been doled out in broadly similar ways to GB, attempting to prop up as much of the economy as possible until lockdown ends.But as time goes on there will be increased scope for local decision-making as to how that money should be spent. If, for instance, it becomes clear that tourist numbers are going to be signicantly depressed for years, does Stormont prop up such a sector, or use that money where Queen’s University academicJohn Barry hassuggested a massive retrofit of the worst insulated homes, something which could improve the lives of those in the most dficult circumstances, improve air quality and provide jobs.\u2028Others have suggested following some European cities which have pedestrianised city centre roads, allowing cafes and cyclists to fill the streets in an attempt to revitalise city precincts which otherwise could shriveleateries are unable to survive by serving only a tiny percentage of their normal customers due to social distancing.With technology having allowed a large percentage of the population to work productively from home, many of those people are either unlikely to everto the office, or to only do so intermittently.That has implications for the historically higher house prices in cities –we don’t need to be in a city centre office, why not buy a larger home further away Those without gardens, and especially those living in expensive shoebox apartments, may after lockdown prioritise securing a morespacious property with a garden or some other outdoor space.If we are trying to stay apart, using public transport is less practical than driving, walking or cycling. Butpassenger numbers collapse, does Stormont then bail out Translink so that it can maintain sparsely-populated bus and train services, or does it ask it to cut services, thus forcing the same number of people on to fewer buses and trains where social distancing will be impossible If a company has been able to effectively maintain its operations with staff working remotely, it decide to stop renting expensive city centre offices, especiallyit is struggling to break even as a result of the recession.Those decisions and a thousand others will then have implications for planning and infrastructure policy, with increased potential for urban sprawl and city centre decay.Politicians will have to decide whether to continuing deepening our relationship with China despite its reckless lies over coronavirus, whether local manufacturing should be prioritised as a part of a move to deglobalisation, the role of the public sector, and relations with unions as relationships between workers and employers are transformed.While very few young people are likely to die from the virus, they will suffer in a decimated job market, with the potential to trigger inter-generationalanger.Yet there is now a rare moment of opportunity for visionary politicians to use their power to reshapehow we live and work. This is a moment which for many politicians never arrives even in a long political career: The chance to dramatically reshape society and fix some of what they knew to be broken.Behind many of these questions, the prudent retort of“how are you going to pay for that” will not retain the potency which it had – at least until there are massive tax hikes – because we have seen how when government felt something was of sufficient importance it was able to borrow money more than at any time since the Second World War. Though largely not a matter for Stormont, the debate will therefore sht from whether borrowing for policy X is possible, to whether it is of sufficient importance to add to the gargantuan national debt – and whether that is fair to future generations.There are also areas where Northern Ireland is well positioned to profit from the post-pandemic world. In recent years Belfast has become a centre of cyber-security expertise. With technology now more dominant in our lives, and the online security commercially paramount as we handle company secrets on laptops in our kitchens or bedrooms, that area has potential for sustained growth.Our large agricultural sector may also benefit as the severing of global supply lines demonstrates the criticality of maintaining food security. Stormont will face an ideologicalargument on top of its traditional constitutionalargument in the midst of what will be at least a recession and possiblya depression – and possibly still a public health crisis.That would challenge any government, let alone our constitutionally and ideologically ided Executive. But it is also an opportunity for it to do something truly momentously meaningful.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues

new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One,
